records&#x2014;<strong>Michael Cohen</strong> made a phone call to <strong>Stephanie Winston Wolkoff.</strong> For years, Cohen and Wolkoff had operated in a shared milieu. Both lived on the same block on the Upper East Side. More notably, both were crucial supporting players in the Trump orbit. Cohen had been an indefatigable booster of <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/donald-trump#intcid=dt-hot-link">Donald Trump</a>,</strong> helping to arrange his real-estate deals, paying off alleged mistresses, and quashing would-be damaging stories regarding his boss. Wolkoff, for a time, was a lesser-known, but equally diligent enforcer for <strong>Melania Trump.</strong></p><!-- react-empty: 231 --><p data-reactid="232">The two women had met years earlier, when Wolkoff helped produce the Metropolitan Museum&#x2019;s Costume Institute Benefit. (<strong>Anna Wintour,</strong> who hosts the gala, is editor-in-chief of <em>Vogue</em> and the artistic director of Cond&#xE9; Nast, <em>Vanity Fair</em>&#x2019;s parent company.) Over the years, Wolkoff would become a member of Melania&#x2019;s small inner circle. After Trump&#x2019;s surprise electoral-college victory, she went on to help the First Lady in Washington, serving as a senior adviser to her official governmental office on matters large and small. Wolkoff helped facilitate Melania&#x2019;s transition to the White House, and advised her on policy platforms, East Wing d&#xE9;cor, and her overall messaging.</p><!-- react-empty: 233 --><!-- react-empty: 234 --><p data-reactid="235">The two were close enough that Wolkoff could openly express divergent views. According to sources familiar with the conversations, Wolkoff told Melania and East Wing staffers that the name for her anti-bullying initiative, &#x201C;Be Best,&#x201D; sounded illiterate. (The First Lady, according to these sources, feared that an alternative, &#x201C;Children First,&#x201D; was too similar to her husband&#x2019;s &#x201C;America First&#x201D; branding.) They also disagreed about the infamous &#x201C;I Really Don&#x2019;t Care, Do U?&#x201D; jacket that the First Lady wore to the U.S.-Mexico border. (Melania, according to these sources, thought the trip would not get attention without such a brazen fashion gesture. In an interview with ABC News in October, she said that she wore the jacket for the media and people who were criticizing her, and wondered aloud whether the trip would have received similar attention without it.) But the two women remained close, nevertheless. On trips to D.C., Wolkoff would sometimes spend the night in the White House residence; other times, she would book a room in the Trump International Hotel down Pennsylvania Avenue. According to e-mail exchanges from the time, she was given the friends and family rate of $345 a night, and told to submit receipts to <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/reince-priebus#intcid=dt-hot-link">Reince Priebus</a>.</strong></p><div data-reactid="236"><div class="embed block row iframe"><div class="wrapper"><div class="embed iframe-embed-component " data-type="iframe" data-url="https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/c97a4730-bc95-4032-b21a-a970764c038c?customColor=%23ff0000"><iframe height="220" width="750" src="https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/c97a4730-bc95-4032-b21a-a970764c038c?customColor=%23ff0000"></iframe></div></div></div></div><p data-reactid="237"><strong><em>iTunes user?

Cohen, of course, went from being one of the president&#x2019;s closest confidants to one of his most bitter and dangerous adversaries. Wolkoff&#x2019;s separation was less public, but is increasingly newsworthy. Through her company, WIS Media Partners, Wolkoff oversaw Trump&#x2019;s sprawling week-long inaugural festivities&#x2014;she sourced and managed third-party vendors, entertainers, and broadcasters, and oversaw the themes and production of all the concerts, dinners, balls, and programming. She worked in close proximity to the Trump family and inaugural chair <strong>Tom Barrack,</strong> a billionaire private-equity real-estate investor who had been a close friend of the president for years. And yet a year after the swearing-in ceremony, Wolkoff left the White House amid an uncomfortable public-relations crisis regarding the president&#x2019;s inaugural committee.</p><p data-reactid="239">Last February, <em>The New York Times</em> published an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/politics/trumps-inaugural-committee-paid-26-million-to-first-ladys-friend.html">article</a> centered on WIS, headlined &#x201C;Trump&#x2019;s Inaugural Committee Paid $26 million to Firm of First Lady&#x2019;s Adviser.&#x201D; The inaugural committee had raised a stunning $107 million&#x2014;about twice what <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/barack-obama#intcid=dt-hot-link">Barack Obama</a></strong> had hauled in 2009&#x2014;from donors such as <strong>Sheldon Adelson</strong> and corporations like AT&amp;T. But as the <em>Times</em> reported, the tax form revealed profligate spending&#x2014;nearly $10 million on travel; $4.6 million on salaries and benefits; and $100,000 to <strong>Rick Gates,</strong> the former campaign aide and deputy chairman of the inauguration who, about a week later, became one of <strong>Robert Mueller&#x2019;s</strong> first major cooperating witnesses. Some $40 million was publicly unaccounted for. Wolkoff, as the event planner in charge, became the face of the disarray. The <em>Times</em> story quoted an official from a government watchdog group accusing the inaugural committee of &#x201C;fiscal mismanagement at its worst.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="240">Privately, Wolkoff refuted the characterization. According to bank statements, checks, and internal documents that I&#x2019;ve reviewed, the $26 million in payment to WIS was largely distributed to third-party vendors and labor. Nearly $24 million was paid for projects related to the work of a subcontractor, Inaugural Productions, an independent organization run by individuals formerly associated with television producer <strong>Mark Burnett,</strong> which was responsible for staging several events. Around $1.6 million was used to compensate 15 contract workers who worked with Wolkoff as staffers. Wolkoff herself received $500,000 for her work on the inauguration. She had submitted audited records to the inauguration committee in March 2017, a month after she signed a gratuitous-services contract to work as an unpaid strategist and senior adviser to the First Lady.</p><div data-reactid="241"><div class="embed image row"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="pinterest-link-container"><img src="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5c5ca4a9d950fb48c24e1c32/master/h_606,c_limit/Stephanie-Winton-Wolkoff-Melania-Trump-embed-01-a.jpg" alt="Stephanie Winston Wolkoff" title data-pin-desc="Stephanie Winston Wolkoff attends Strut: The Fashionable Mom Show during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in 2014.

But the administration demurred. <strong>Stephanie Grisham,</strong> the First Lady&#x2019;s spokesperson, wrote in an e-mail, &#x201C;This messaging is the best way to go in order to minimize the negative press stories of today and protect FLOTUS &amp; this administration.&#x201D; A week later, Wolkoff left the East Wing after the White House instilled new security protocols in the wake of the <strong>Rob Porter</strong> scandal. A member of the White House Counsel&#x2019;s Office called her on February 20, 2018, to let her know that the White House would be terminating all gratuitous-services agreements, including hers. It had nothing to do with her work on the inauguration, this person told her. &#x201C;I am sorry that the professional part of our relationship has come to an end, but I am comforted in the fact that our [friendship] far outweigh[s] politics,&#x201D; Melania wrote her in an e-mail later that day. &#x201C;Thank you Again! Much love.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="243">Later that evening, in a phone call, Wolkoff told the First Lady that she worried it appeared as if she had been fired on account of her work on the inauguration. The First Lady urged her not to be &#x201C;dramatic.&#x201D; Less than a week later, however, the <em>Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/melania-trump-inauguration-adviser.html">published a story</a> stating that the severance of Wolkoff&#x2019;s contract had been &#x201C;prompted by displeasure from the Trumps&#x201D; over the $26 million payment. Grisham told the <em>Times</em> that Melania &#x201C;had no involvement&#x201D; with the inaugural committee, and &#x201C;had no knowledge of how funds were spent.&#x201D; The president would create similar distance. <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> would later say, &#x201C;The president was focused on the transition during that time, and not on any of the planning for the inauguration.&#x201D; (A spokeswoman for the First Lady declined to comment for this story, as did the White House.)</p><p data-reactid="244">By the time Cohen and Wolkoff spoke last summer, she had returned to her life in New York. He would soon plead guilty to eight counts in a federal courthouse downtown. But Cohen let Wolkoff know that, among other documents and recordings, the F.B.I. had seized hours of their own conversations that he had taped. According to people familiar with the recordings, some of the taped conversations dealt directly with the inauguration. In them, Wolkoff detailed her own contemporaneous concerns with the inauguration&#x2014;about how money was being spent, the general chaos of the process, and the involvement of Trump&#x2019;s adult children. During these conversations, Wolkoff also raised her issues with the two men in charge of the committee: Gates and Barrack.</p><p data-reactid="245">These recordings, in part, led the Southern District of New York to launch a criminal investigation into how the inaugural committee spent its record $107 million. Now, the investigation appears to be advancing. In December, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-inauguration-spending-under-criminal-investigation-by-federal-prosecutors-11544736455"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/trump-inauguration-investigation.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported that prosecutors are examining the committee&#x2019;s spending, and investigating whether foreign donors from nations including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates funneled money to the committee in an effort to influence U.S. policy. On Monday, the inaugural committee received a subpoena from the S.D.N.Y. requesting documents related to spending and donors, vendors, and benefits handed out, as well as documents related to a wealthy donor who had once registered as a foreign agent working on behalf of the Sri Lankan government. The <em>Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-inauguration-spending-under-criminal-investigation-by-federal-prosecutors-11544736455">reported</a> that prosecutors have asked Gates about the inaugural fund&#x2019;s spending and its donors. (<strong>Lorin Reisner</strong>, an attorney for Wolkoff, said in a statement: &#x201C;Stephanie is not going to comment on these reports. She remains proud of her work on the inauguration, and we are confident that her conduct was proper in all respects.&#x201D; Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.)</p><p data-reactid="246">The subpoena is the latest sign that, while the Mueller investigation could be winding down, the Southern District may be probing a variety of Trump-adjacent avenues into the foreseeable future. An inquiry into the inauguration might also be acutely poignant, given Trump&#x2019;s concurrent association with both his business and his incoming administration in its earliest days. It involved big money and outside influence. And it involved the Trump family in intimate, important ways. Wolkoff, suddenly and unexpectedly, could find herself in the middle of the maelstrom.</p></section><section class="content-section" data-reactid="247"><p data-reactid="248">Wolkoff had made a career in the events business, but she knew from the outset the inauguration would be a unique, and uniquely Trumpian, experience. First, she was a political novice who knew little about what an inauguration entailed. Then, there was Trump&#x2019;s controversial reputation. Upon accepting the post on the Friday after his election, Wolkoff quickly reached out to her network of vendors. Most of them, according to people familiar with these conversations, resisted the opportunity to work with Trump. Even Burnett, who Trump enlisted to conjure up reality-show-like gimmicks (such as flying a gaggle of drones over the crowd), wanted to keep his involvement private. (Burnett did not respond to a request for comment.)</p><p data-reactid="249">Moreover, and perhaps not surprisingly, Trump&#x2019;s family wanted to be involved in certain aspects of the coordination. Part of this, of course, was because they were going to be included in many of the events and, logistically, they had to know where to be and what to wear. It was also because Trump&#x2019;s adult children have always been involved in affairs pertaining to their father, from his businesses to <em>The Apprentice</em> to his campaign. Each week, Wolkoff met with senior inaugural-committee members to present itemized, detailed updates on the status of her planning and financial reports from each vendor and for each event. She was also making regular presentations to Trump, Melania, and the Trump family about various decisions, so that they could weigh in. (White House spokespeople have previously denied that the Trumps were involved in any planning, and said they knew little about the events.) Trump and <strong>Ivanka</strong> were briefed on Burnett&#x2019;s drone idea, for instance, after they had met with singer <strong>Andrea Bocelli</strong> in his office in Trump Tower about the possibility of him singing at an event. (The Italian tenor did not end up performing.)</p><p data-reactid="250">Trump was focused on the big-picture theatrics. He wanted to arrive on the Mall in a military plane with a military escort, much as he had arrived for tapings of <em>The Apprentice</em> on Trump Organization helicopters. He also wanted to have a full military parade, as well as tanks and helicopters on the ground. Ivanka, meanwhile, had more particular interests, according to e-mail and text exchanges and people familiar with the conversations. Originally, Ivanka wanted to host an event for women on the Wednesday before her father&#x2019;s swearing-in ceremony. (The plan was ultimately scrapped.) To be helpful, she suggested a photographer who had once shot her for <em>Town &amp; Country</em> as someone who could take the official family portrait. She also offered a D.J. friend of hers from New York as a possible performer. She texted photos of the Obama family standing onstage together, with <strong>Sasha</strong> and <strong>Malia</strong> prominently situated in the middle of the frame. &#x201C;FYI regarding the swearing in, it is nice to have family with him for this special moment,&#x201D; she wrote.</p><div data-reactid="251"><div class="embed image row"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="pinterest-link-container"><img src="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5c5ca4a99e70dd2f91afe3b5/master/w_690,c_limit/Stephanie-Winton-Wolkoff-Melania-Trump-embed-02.jpg" alt="Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushne" title data-pin-desc="Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner dance at the Inaugural Ball.

Bernstein/Getty Images.</div></div></figcaption></figure></div></div><p data-reactid="252">In large part, Wolkoff worried about potential ethical issues surrounding the First Family-elect and their businesses. After all, Gates had been staying in a suite at the Trump Hotel for most of the inaugural planning. More than a dozen inaugural staffers had also been staying there. The <em>Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/trump-inauguration-spending.html">reported</a> last month that WIS alone had charged $31,000 for hotel rooms in the span of less than two months, including almost $18,000 at the Trump International Hotel. That did not include what was charged for room service, meals, and travel. In all, the Trump International Hotel was paid more than $1.5 million in inaugural funds, according to the <em>Times.</em> (Wolkoff&#x2019;s contract states that the inaugural committee would reimburse WIS for travel, long-distance phone calls, mail-delivery services, and expenses connected to the performance of its work. WIS stands for &#x201C;Who Is She,&#x201D; Wolkoff&#x2019;s play on her own anonymity.)</p><p data-reactid="253">During the course of planning, Wolkoff had corresponded with Ivanka about the cost of using the Trump Hotel for events leading up to the swearing-in ceremony. On December 10, 2016, a Trump Organization employee sent an estimate for a ballroom rental and food and beverage minimum to use the Trump Hotel space for eight days. The price she quoted was $3.6 million, according to an e-mail. A week later, Gates e-mailed Ivanka about the cost. In this exchange, first <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-trumps-inauguration-paid-trumps-company-with-ivanka-in-the-middle">published</a> this past December by ProPublica and WNYC, Wolkoff flagged her concern. &#x201C;These events are in PE&#x2019;s [the president-elect&#x2019;s] honor at his hotel and one of them is for family and close friends. Please take into consideration that when this is audited it will become public knowledge,&#x201D; she wrote. (<strong>Peter Mirijanian,</strong> a spokesperson for Ivanka&#x2019;s counsel <strong>Abbe Lowell,</strong> said in a statement: &#x201C;When contacted by someone working on the inauguration, Ms. Trump passed the inquiry on to a hotel official and said only that any resulting discussions should be at a &#x2018;fair market rate.&#x2019; Ms. Trump was not involved in any additional discussions.&#x201D;)</p><p data-reactid="254">For an event producer used to detailed lists and punctilious itemization, Wolkoff was often caught off guard by the ad-hoc nature of the committee. According to the two people familiar with the matter, Gates approached a couple individuals working on the inauguration and asked if they would be willing to be paid directly for their work by a donor, rather than by the inaugural committee. They had received more donations than they&#x2019;d initially anticipated, Gates told these people. Skirting the usual payment route could allow the inaugural committee to avoid reporting the full amount raised from donors. (A lawyer for Gates did not respond to a request for comment.)</p><p data-reactid="255">Wolkoff frequently told Melania about her concerns regarding Gates, these people said. She relayed her concern about the high access level of his security pass within Trump Tower and his closeness with the Trump family. In her view, these people said, he exacerbated a situation already fraught with potential conflicts of interest. Members of the inaugural committee talked about how he frequently worked out of <strong>Donald Trump Jr.&#x2019;s</strong> office. He was in constant communication with the adult children in order to keep them in the loop about decisions surrounding the inauguration.</p><p data-reactid="256">Wolkoff also questioned Gates and Barrack about pricing and budgets across the board, according to the people familiar with the conversations. She started to grow concerned about being left out of meetings, particularly as she raised more red flags. Because part of her responsibilities included reviewing all budgets from her vendors and presenting them to other members of the inaugural committee, she studied the line items in order to be able to explain them. At points, she could not justify the numbers coming in. After circulation of a quote from one of their largest event-production vendors, Hargrove LLC, Wolkoff was shocked that no one in the organization appeared willing to question the figures. She suggested that the quote seemed far beyond what the Obama inaugural committee would have been charged in 2009. She sent an e-mail to her team and Barrack on December 31, 2016. &#x201C;I am DISGUSTED by [Hargrove&#x2019;s] lack of transparency and entitlement to [the Presidential Inaugural Committee&#x2019;s] funding,&#x201D; she wrote. &#x201C;I can not approve any budget line items because I do not have a clue what these numbers represent!!&#x201D; (Hargrove did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)</p><p data-reactid="257">One of the most concerning aspects to Wolkoff&#x2019;s team, according to the people familiar with the situation, was the amount of money and attention being spent on Barrack&#x2019;s chairman dinner, which he hosted on an evening before the swearing-in. A draft guest list for the event from days before the dinner included the likes of retired Lieutenant General <strong>Mike Flynn,</strong> G.O.P. fund-raiser <strong>Elliott Broidy,</strong> Michael Cohen, and key officials in the incoming administration. Among the list marked as confirmed were seven people described as &#x201C;foreign ministers&#x201D; for Saudi Arabia, one foreign minister from Qatar, and one from the United Arab Emirates. They were the only people on the list who were unnamed. (On Tuesday, ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-tom-barrack-colony-company-of-trump-inaugural-chair-sought-to-profit">published</a> a memo that showed Barrack&#x2019;s investment firm planned to profit from its connections to the Trump administration. A spokesperson called it &#x201C;an outline of a proposed potential business plan which was never acted upon or implemented.&#x201D;)</p><p data-reactid="258">A spokesman for Barrack declined to comment, but pointed me toward comments Barrack made in a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chairmans-global-dinner-most-exclusive-event-preceding-trump-inauguration-1484571781"><em>Journal</em> report</a> published days before the inauguration. &#x201C;The evening is intended to be the president-elect&#x2019;s first fingerprint on the global canvas of social democracy and outreach,&#x201D; Barrack said at the time, explaining that the evening was set up to reach out to local international diplomats and create a &#x201C;hopeful tapestry of international cooperation and respect.&#x201D;</p></section><section class="content-section" data-reactid="259"><p data-reactid="260">Much has been made of the various problems with the inauguration, from the lackluster crowd size to the president&#x2019;s own &#x201C;American carnage&#x201D; speech, which struck a tone so dark that <strong>George W. Bush</strong> was reportedly heard calling it &#x201C;some weird shit.&#x201D; But Wolkoff&#x2019;s part, the event itself, went off without a hitch, and the family was pleased. The day after the swearing-in ceremony was Wolkoff&#x2019;s birthday. The Trumps sent flowers to the Trump Hotel room where she had been staying. She flew back to New York on a military plane with Melania, her stylist, hairdresser, makeup artist, and the rest of the Trump family, apart from the president, Ivanka, and <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> who remained in Washington.</p><p data-reactid="261">Much is still unknown about how inaugural funds were managed, or if the unaccounted for $40-odd million will ever be publicly explained. It&#x2019;s unclear whether there was foreign influence, or illicit attempts to profit off of proceedings. What Gates has offered investigators&#x2014;about anything, really, but about the inauguration, in particular&#x2014;is also unclear. How deep the Southern District&#x2019;s investigation into all of this is yet unknown. But much like some of Cohen&#x2019;s other taped conversations, the discussions with Wolkoff about the inauguration may have turned out to be consequential. On the witness stand during <strong>Paul Manafort&#x2019;s</strong> trial in Virginia last summer, prosecutors asked Gates if he charged personal expenses to the committee. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s possible,&#x201D; he responded.</p><p data-reactid="262">As investigators continue to pursue the matter, they may find themselves in a familiar situation: seeking out former Trump allies-turned-adversaries who saw it all go down firsthand. One of the most inexplicable plot points in the whirling Trump drama has been the president&#x2019;s public treatment of his former lawyer. Trump was aware that Cohen possessed all manner of damaging information about him, and yet he wasted few opportunities to disparage him publicly. Ultimately, Cohen implicated Trump in federal campaign-finance violations as he pleaded guilty. He spent more than 70 hours cooperating with federal investigators, opening his book to tell them what he knew about the president, his business, and the campaign. While Wolkoff&#x2019;s treatment has been gentler, she&#x2019;s been similarly isolated and publicly disparaged. And now, what she knows could be of interest to investigators, too.</p><p data-reactid="263"><em>This story has been updated to reflect Mark Burnett&apos;s connection to Inaugural

Both lived on the same block on the Upper East Side. More notably, both were crucial supporting players in the Trump orbit. Cohen had been an indefatigable booster of <strong><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/people/donald-trump#intcid=dt-hot-link\">Donald Trump</a>,</strong> helping to arrange his real-estate deals, paying off alleged mistresses, and quashing would-be damaging stories regarding his boss.

(<strong>Anna Wintour,</strong> who hosts the gala, is editor-in-chief of <em>Vogue</em> and the artistic director of Cond&#xE9; Nast, <em>Vanity Fair</em>&#x2019;s parent company.) Over the years, Wolkoff would become a member of Melania&#x2019;s small inner circle. After Trump&#x2019;s surprise electoral-college victory, she went on to help the First Lady in Washington, serving as a senior adviser to her official governmental office on matters large and small.

According to sources familiar with the conversations, Wolkoff told Melania and East Wing staffers that the name for her anti-bullying initiative, &#x201C;Be Best,&#x201D; sounded illiterate. (The First Lady, according to these sources, feared that an alternative, &#x201C;Children First,&#x201D; was too similar to her husband&#x2019;s &#x201C;America First&#x201D; branding.) They also disagreed about the infamous &#x201C;I Really Don&#x2019;t Care, Do U?&#x201D; jacket that the First Lady wore to the U.S.-Mexico border. (Melania, according to these sources, thought the trip would not get attention without such a brazen fashion gesture. In an interview with ABC News in October, she said that she wore the jacket for the media and people who were criticizing her, and wondered aloud whether the trip would have received similar attention without it.) But the two women remained close, nevertheless. On trips to D.C., Wolkoff would sometimes spend the night in the White House residence; other times, she would book a room in the Trump International Hotel down Pennsylvania Avenue. According to e-mail exchanges from the time, she was given the friends and family rate of $345 a night, and told to submit receipts to <strong><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/people/reince-priebus#intcid=dt-hot-link\">Reince Priebus</a>.</strong></p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/c97a4730-bc95-4032-b21a-a970764c038c?customColor=%23ff0000\"><iframe height=\"220\" width=\"750\" src=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/c97a4730-bc95-4032-b21a-a970764c038c?customColor=%23ff0000\"></iframe></div></div></div>","isEmbed":false,"type":"div"},{"content":"<p><strong><em>iTunes user?

Cohen, of course, went from being one of the president&#x2019;s closest confidants to one of his most bitter and dangerous adversaries. Wolkoff&#x2019;s separation was less public, but is increasingly newsworthy. Through her company, WIS Media Partners, Wolkoff oversaw Trump&#x2019;s sprawling week-long inaugural festivities&#x2014;she sourced and managed third-party vendors, entertainers, and broadcasters, and oversaw the themes and production of all the concerts, dinners, balls, and programming. She worked in close proximity to the Trump family and inaugural chair <strong>Tom Barrack,</strong> a billionaire private-equity real-estate investor who had been a close friend of the president for years.

But as the <em>Times</em> reported, the tax form revealed profligate spending&#x2014;nearly $10 million on travel; $4.6 million on salaries and benefits; and $100,000 to <strong>Rick Gates,</strong> the former campaign aide and deputy chairman of the inauguration who, about a week later, became one of <strong>Robert Mueller&#x2019;s</strong> first major cooperating witnesses. Some $40 million was publicly unaccounted for. Wolkoff, as the event planner in charge, became the face of the disarray.

Nearly $24 million was paid for projects related to the work of a subcontractor, Inaugural Productions, an independent organization run by individuals formerly associated with television producer <strong>Mark Burnett,</strong> which was responsible for staging several events. Around $1.6 million was used to compensate 15 contract workers who worked with Wolkoff as staffers. Wolkoff herself received $500,000 for her work on the inauguration.

A member of the White House Counsel&#x2019;s Office called her on February 20, 2018, to let her know that the White House would be terminating all gratuitous-services agreements, including hers.

He would soon plead guilty to eight counts in a federal courthouse downtown. But Cohen let Wolkoff know that, among other documents and recordings, the F.B.I. had seized hours of their own conversations that he had taped. According to people familiar with the recordings, some of the taped conversations dealt directly with the inauguration. In them, Wolkoff detailed her own contemporaneous concerns with the inauguration&#x2014;about how money was being spent, the general chaos of the process, and the involvement of Trump&#x2019;s adult children. During these conversations, Wolkoff also raised her issues with the two men in charge of the committee: Gates and Barrack.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>These recordings, in part, led the Southern District of New York to launch a criminal investigation into how the inaugural committee spent its record $107 million. Now, the investigation appears to be advancing. In December, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-inauguration-spending-under-criminal-investigation-by-federal-prosecutors-11544736455\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/trump-inauguration-investigation.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported that prosecutors are examining the committee&#x2019;s spending, and investigating whether foreign donors from nations including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates funneled money to the committee in an effort to influence U.S. policy. On Monday, the inaugural committee received a subpoena from the S.D.N.Y. requesting documents related to spending and donors, vendors, and benefits handed out, as well as documents related to a wealthy donor who had once registered as a foreign agent working on behalf of the Sri Lankan government. The <em>Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-inauguration-spending-under-criminal-investigation-by-federal-prosecutors-11544736455\">reported</a> that prosecutors have asked Gates about the inaugural fund&#x2019;s spending and its donors.

An inquiry into the inauguration might also be acutely poignant, given Trump&#x2019;s concurrent association with both his business and his incoming administration in its earliest days.

First, she was a political novice who knew little about what an inauguration entailed. Then, there was Trump&#x2019;s controversial reputation. Upon accepting the post on the Friday after his election, Wolkoff quickly reached out to her network of vendors. Most of them, according to people familiar with these conversations, resisted the opportunity to work with Trump. Even Burnett, who Trump enlisted to conjure up reality-show-like gimmicks (such as flying a gaggle of drones over the crowd), wanted to keep his involvement private. (Burnett did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>Moreover, and perhaps not surprisingly, Trump&#x2019;s family wanted to be involved in certain aspects of the coordination. Part of this, of course, was because they were going to be included in many of the events and, logistically, they had to know where to be and what to wear. It was also because Trump&#x2019;s adult children have always been involved in affairs pertaining to their father, from his businesses to <em>The Apprentice</em> to his campaign. Each week, Wolkoff met with senior inaugural-committee members to present itemized, detailed updates on the status of her planning and financial reports from each vendor and for each event. She was also making regular presentations to Trump, Melania, and the Trump family about various decisions, so that they could weigh in. (White House spokespeople have previously denied that the Trumps were involved in any planning, and said they knew little about the events.) Trump and <strong>Ivanka</strong> were briefed on Burnett&#x2019;s drone idea, for instance, after they had met with singer <strong>Andrea Bocelli</strong> in his office in Trump Tower about the possibility of him singing at an event.

He wanted to arrive on the Mall in a military plane with a military escort, much as he had arrived for tapings of <em>The Apprentice</em> on Trump Organization helicopters. He also wanted to have a full military parade, as well as tanks and helicopters on the ground. Ivanka, meanwhile, had more particular interests, according to e-mail and text exchanges and people familiar with the conversations. Originally, Ivanka wanted to host an event for women on the Wednesday before her father&#x2019;s swearing-in ceremony. (The plan was ultimately scrapped.) To be helpful, she suggested a photographer who had once shot her for <em>Town &amp; Country</em> as someone who could take the official family portrait. She also offered a D.J. friend of hers from New York as a possible performer. She texted photos of the Obama family standing onstage together, with <strong>Sasha</strong> and <strong>Malia</strong> prominently situated in the middle of the frame. &#x201C;FYI regarding the swearing in, it is nice to have family with him for this special moment,&#x201D; she wrote.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<div class=\"embed image row\"><figure class=\"embedded-image\" data-type=\"image\"><div class=\"pinterest-link-container\"><img src=\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5c5ca4a99e70dd2f91afe3b5/master/w_690,c_limit/Stephanie-Winton-Wolkoff-Melania-Trump-embed-02.jpg\" alt=\"Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushne\" title data-pin-desc=\"Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner dance at the Inaugural Ball.\n\" data-pin-credits><a class=\"pinterest-link\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fnews%2F2019%2F02%2Fbehind-the-scenes-of-trumps-107-million-inauguration&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.vanityfair.com%2Fphotos%2F5c5ca4a99e70dd2f91afe3b5%2Fmaster%2Fw_690%2Cc_limit%2FStephanie-Winton-Wolkoff-Melania-Trump-embed-02.jpg&amp;description=Ivanka%20Trump%20and%20Jared%20Kushner%20dance%20at%20the%20Inaugural%20Ball.%0A\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div><figcaption class=\"caption callout-image-caption\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><span class=\"caption\"><p>Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner dance at the Inaugural Ball.</p>\n</span><div class=\"credits\">By Aaron P.

After all, Gates had been staying in a suite at the Trump Hotel for most of the inaugural planning. More than a dozen inaugural staffers had also been staying there. The <em>Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/trump-inauguration-spending.html\">reported</a> last month that WIS alone had charged $31,000 for hotel rooms in the span of less than two months, including almost $18,000 at the Trump International Hotel. That did not include what was charged for room service, meals, and travel. In all, the Trump International Hotel was paid more than $1.5 million in inaugural funds, according to the <em>Times.</em> (Wolkoff&#x2019;s contract states that the inaugural committee would reimburse WIS for travel, long-distance phone calls, mail-delivery services, and expenses connected to the performance of its work.

On December 10, 2016, a Trump Organization employee sent an estimate for a ballroom rental and food and beverage minimum to use the Trump Hotel space for eight days. The price she quoted was $3.6 million, according to an e-mail. A week later, Gates e-mailed Ivanka about the cost. In this exchange, first <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-trumps-inauguration-paid-trumps-company-with-ivanka-in-the-middle\">published</a> this past December by ProPublica and WNYC, Wolkoff flagged her concern. &#x201C;These events are in PE&#x2019;s [the president-elect&#x2019;s] honor at his hotel and one of them is for family and close friends. Please take into consideration that when this is audited it will become public knowledge,&#x201D; she wrote. (<strong>Peter Mirijanian,</strong> a spokesperson for Ivanka&#x2019;s counsel <strong>Abbe Lowell,</strong> said in a statement: &#x201C;When contacted by someone working on the inauguration, Ms. Trump passed the inquiry on to a hotel official and said only that any resulting discussions should be at a &#x2018;fair market rate.&#x2019; Ms. Trump was not involved in any additional discussions.&#x201D;)</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>For an event producer used to detailed lists and punctilious itemization, Wolkoff was often caught off guard by the ad-hoc nature of the committee. According to the two people familiar with the matter, Gates approached a couple individuals working on the inauguration and asked if they would be willing to be paid directly for their work by a donor, rather than by the inaugural committee. They had received more donations than they&#x2019;d initially anticipated, Gates told these people. Skirting the usual payment route could allow the inaugural committee to avoid reporting the full amount raised from donors. (A lawyer for Gates did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>Wolkoff frequently told Melania about her concerns regarding Gates, these people said. She relayed her concern about the high access level of his security pass within Trump Tower and his closeness with the Trump family. In her view, these people said, he exacerbated a situation already fraught with potential conflicts of interest. Members of the inaugural committee talked about how he frequently worked out of <strong>Donald Trump Jr.&#x2019;s</strong> office. He was in constant communication with the adult children in order to keep them in the loop about decisions surrounding the inauguration.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>Wolkoff also questioned Gates and Barrack about pricing and budgets across the board, according to the people familiar with the conversations. She started to grow concerned about being left out of meetings, particularly as she raised more red flags. Because part of her responsibilities included reviewing all budgets from her vendors and presenting them to other members of the inaugural committee, she studied the line items in order to be able to explain them. At points, she could not justify the numbers coming in. After circulation of a quote from one of their largest event-production vendors, Hargrove LLC, Wolkoff was shocked that no one in the organization appeared willing to question the figures. She suggested that the quote seemed far beyond what the Obama inaugural committee would have been charged in 2009. She sent an e-mail to her team and Barrack on December 31, 2016. &#x201C;I am DISGUSTED by [Hargrove&#x2019;s] lack of transparency and entitlement to [the Presidential Inaugural Committee&#x2019;s] funding,&#x201D; she wrote. &#x201C;I can not approve any budget line items because I do not have a clue what these numbers represent!!&#x201D; (Hargrove did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>One of the most concerning aspects to Wolkoff&#x2019;s team, according to the people familiar with the situation, was the amount of money and attention being spent on Barrack&#x2019;s chairman dinner, which he hosted on an evening before the swearing-in. A draft guest list for the event from days before the dinner included the likes of retired Lieutenant General <strong>Mike Flynn,</strong> G.O.P. fund-raiser <strong>Elliott Broidy,</strong> Michael Cohen, and key officials in the incoming administration. Among the list marked as confirmed were seven people described as &#x201C;foreign ministers&#x201D; for Saudi Arabia, one foreign minister from Qatar, and one from the United Arab Emirates.

Trump was aware that Cohen possessed all manner of damaging information about him, and yet he wasted few opportunities to disparage him publicly. Ultimately, Cohen implicated Trump in federal campaign-finance violations as he pleaded guilty. He spent more than 70 hours cooperating with federal investigators, opening his book to tell them what he knew about the president, his business, and the campaign. While Wolkoff&#x2019;s treatment has been gentler, she&#x2019;s been similarly isolated and publicly disparaged.

So let’s just zero in on the money.\n<p>“I’m <em>really</em> rich,” Trump declared while announcing his candidacy in June 2015. To prove it, he released a “Summary of Net Worth” balance sheet, indicating a net worth of $8,737,540,000. A month later he upwardly revised that figure to “in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.” (The caps are his.)</p>\n<p>Since then, a cottage industry of spreadsheet-diving journalists has worked itself into a lather trying to peg his real net worth.

Despite the all-caps figures Trump has dispensed, most estimates from the established financial-media outlets have been lower, FAR LOWER. <em>Forbes</em> put his net worth at $4.5 billion. <em>Fortune</em> postulated $3.7 billion, and later upped it to $3.9 billion. Bloomberg guessed it was “closer to $2.9 billion.”</p>\n<p>In response to these wanton guesstimates, Trump instinctually fired back at the guesstimators. “<em>Forbes</em> is a bankrupt magazine, doesn’t know what they’re talking about.” “<em>Fortune</em> has no idea what my assets are” and “has totally lost its way.” But the real sulfuric acid was reserved for the lowballers over at Bloomberg. As usual, Trump made it personal, even suggesting his “friend,” the former New York City mayor, might be jealous. “Maybe Michael told them to do it,” Trump speculated in the <em>Daily Mail,</em> “because he always wanted to do what I’m doing.” Perhaps wisely, <em>The New Yorker</em>&#8212;even with its legendary phalanx of persnickety fact-checkers&#8212;wouldn’t venture any closer than “just a back-of-the-envelope calculation” of $2.56 billion, “which shouldn’t be taken too seriously.”</p>\n<p>In November, Trump was elected president of the United States in a shocking turn of events. He lost the popular vote by some two million ballots.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/donald-trump","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"5748bf9ab58adb2f614da195","revision":5,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"August 1, 2017 5:46 pm","uri":"people/donald-trump"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Trump Reportedly Does All His Own Makeup","promoHed":"Trump Reportedly Does All His Own Makeup","dek":"If no tanning beds exist within White House walls, what is the source of Trump’s infamous hue?","promoDek":"If no tanning beds exist within White House walls, what is the source of Trump’s infamous hue?","body":"<p>Long before <strong>President Trump</strong> decried investigations of his office over Twitter, a gentler query dogged the celebrity businessman: how does he maintain his infamous orange hue, even while residing in wintry D.C.? It’s a question that persists into the third year of Trump’s tenure in the White House, and investigations of the matter have yielded surprising insight into the commander in chief’s styling habits.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/us/politics/trump-tan.html\">The New York Times</a></em> pursued the idea as a matter of Trump’s health, though a senior administration official only offered that Trump’s notable tan&#8212;in February, no less&#8212;is the result of “good genes.” Further investigation revealed that neither tanning beds nor spray-tan booths exist within the White House or Air Force One, at least according to senior officials. Former aide <strong>Omarosa Manigault Newman</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/death-spiral-why-omarosa-totally-triggered-trump\">wrote in a tell-all book</a> that Trump travels with a tanning bed, while lighter-hued circles around the president’s eyes have fueled speculation that he utilizes goggles to protect himself from ultraviolet rays.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, neither bronzer nor tanning cream has been observed among Trump’s bathroom grooming products, at least when the president has offered a tour of the facilities to supporters. Trump, who suffers from rosacea, is reported to apply his own translucent makeup powder before television appearances, and has even adjusted the lighting at White House events to avoid appearing too orange on-screen. When possible, he prefers the natural light of the White House Rose Garden.</p>\n<p>Trump’s orange hue has also proven a frequent source of media ridicule, even as <em>Saturday Night Live</em> star <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> has suggested makeup artists deliberately avoid exaggerating the shade&#8212;at <strong>Lorne Michaels’s</strong> behest&#8212;so as “not to over-orange anything out of malice.” Baldwin has otherwise described Trump’s look as somewhere between “Mark Rothko orange” and a “slightly paler Orange Crush.”</p>\n<p>The president is famously self-sufficient when it comes to appearance, even detailing the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/photos/2015/09/an-illustrated-history-of-donald-trumps-hair\">elaborate process</a> behind his signature swooping blond hair. And while an unnamed former campaign hand admitted Trump’s orange glow is “a captivating story,” they insisted Trump’s grooming habits are his own secret to keep.</p>","rubric":"45

on Friday, and has agreed to back pay some 800,000 federal workers the salaries they missed during the previous 35-day shutdown. But when it comes to the federal contractors who also went unpaid during that period&#8212;up to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/13/18223471/back-pay-federal-contractors-shutdown\">580,000 people</a>, according to one estimate&#8212;it gets trickier. “I’ve been told the president won’t sign” anything that guarantees them back pay, Senator <strong>Roy Blunt</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-blocking-contractor-back-pay-gov-t-funding-deal-lawmaker-n971226\">told reporters</a> on Wednesday. “I guess federal contractors are different in his view than federal employees.”</p>\n<p>On the 2016 campaign trail, it was a well-known (but ultimately overlooked) fact that Trump <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-business-plan-left-a-trail-of-unpaid-bills-1465504454\">routinely refused to pay contractors</a> during his career as a businessman. But the idea of paying these contractors reportedly had bipartisan support, until <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> shot it down. A legislative source <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/429827-push-to-include-contractor-back-pay-in-funding-deal-hits-gop-roadblock\">told</a> the Hill that the administrative cost alone to pay back the contractors would be as high as the back pay itself, and that previous shutdown negotiations did not include this provision. “That was not initially part of our deal,” Senator <strong>Richard Shelby</strong> explained. “I personally would rather keep it narrow in scope.”</p>\n<p>Other Republicans, such as <strong>John Cornyn,</strong> seemed to take joy in turning contractor pain to political gain. “<strong>[Nancy] Pelosi</strong> and <strong>[Chuck] Schumer</strong> should have thought about this and other collateral damage when they initially refused to negotiate on border security, something they are apparently now willing to do,” he told NBC News. “Thousands of federal contractors have not been reimbursed from the 35-day shutdown,” Schumer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1095770911196831744\">said</a> in response to these reports. “This issue is hanging in the balance. . . .

let go of his longtime rivalry with <em>S.N.L.,</em> squeezing in a ding at the “Democrat spin machine” here, a defense of <strong>Kanye West</strong> there, but largely ignoring its jabs. That appeared to change Sunday morning, as Trump resumed his full-throated attacks after a particularly scathing series of sketches. “Nothing funny about tired <em>Saturday Night Live</em> on Fake News NBC!” he tweeted.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The president presumably caught wind of Saturday’s cold open, which featured <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> reprising his long-standing impression to mock the president’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-national-emergency-declaration-wall\">declaration</a> of a national emergency on Friday. Trump and his ilk have famously bristled at the impression, and didn’t take kindly to <em>Saturday Night Live</em> recounting&#8212;arguably without parody&#8212;the controversial press conference.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block video row\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8vQlhWBvAwY\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"> </iframe></div></div><p>“Wall works, wall makes safe. You don’t have to be smart to understand that&#8212;in fact, it’s even easier to understand if you’re not that smart,” he said, increasingly stunting his grammar. “You can all see why I gotta fake this national emergency, right? I have to because I want to. It’s really simple. We have a problem. Drugs are coming into this country through no wall.”</p>\n<p>The impression also took aim at Trump’s own sing-song recital of the challenges his declaration will face in court.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ll immediately be sued, and the ruling will not go in my favor and then\nend up in the Supreme Court, and then I’ll call my buddy Kavanaugh\nand I’ll say, ‘It’s time to repay the Donny,’ and he’ll say, ‘New phone, who dis?’\nAnd by then the Mueller report will be released, crumbling my house of cards,\nand I can just plead insanity and do a few months in the puzzle factory and my\npersonal hell of playing president will finally be over.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the real Trump threatening “retribution” for NBC’s “Republican hit jobs,” the president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097117499336855553\">reiterated his talking point</a> that “THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!” Trump had kept largely silent on the topic of <em>S.N.L.</em> in recent months, only piping up when supporter Kanye West controversially <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/kanye-west-trump-rant-video-saturday-night-live-snl-chris-rock-instagram\">donned a “Make America Great Again” hat</a> in a September outro:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1046443996074127361\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1046443996074127361\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1046443996074127361</a></p></blockquote></div><p>He also raged against the network in December, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1074302851906707457\">tweeting</a>, “A REAL scandal is the one sided coverage, hour by hour, of networks like NBC &amp; Democrat spin machines like <em>Saturday Night Live.</em> It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials.

Get you a large adult son who can do both, as they say.</p>\n<p>Trump Jr. attended Malaysian designer <strong>Zang Toi’s</strong> show at Spring Studios on Wednesday. His look for the night was salt-and-pepper beard. Against all known <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/science-explains-why-a-beard-makes-you-look-hotter_n_6618142\">beard science, which states men look better with beards</a>, his look is more of a bot that is getting better and better at this smiling thing every day. His family <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2018/11/26/lead-pamela-brown-dnt-trump-ignoring-everything-jake-tapper.cnn\">has not put much faith in science</a>, anyway.</p>\n<p>Junior’s ex-stepmother, <strong>Marla Maples,</strong> was there, too, sitting a cool three seats away from him&#8212;close enough to look like they’re a part of one big party, and far enough away that she could convincingly avoid eye contact. (In past years, <a href=\"https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/presidents-former-wife-a-regular-zang-toi-10987395/\">Toi has invited</a> Junior’s mom and the president’s first ex-wife, <strong>Ivana Trump.</strong>) Between the biggest Trump boy and Maples was Fox News’ <em>America’s Newsroom</em> host <strong>Bill Hemmer</strong> and Fox News personality-turned-Don Jr’s girlfriend <strong>Kimberly Guilfoyle.</strong></p>\n<p>There at the fashion show, Junior told the press that he’s dating a cool girl. She fishes and shoots guns, he said, but also wears makeup and the fashions. “[Guilfoyle has] even been out with me down to Texas with some of my buddies there. They all go, ‘Hey, it’s a guy camp. Are you sure she’s going to be O.K.?’ I’m like, ‘Don’t worry, boys. I’m making you sign a waiver. She’s going to destroy all of you,’” he <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/02/13/donald-trump-jr-and-kimberly-guilfoyle-to-keep-it-low-key-for-valentines-day/\">told</a> the <em>New York Post.</em></p>\n<p>Toi’s finale look was an American flag skirt that could very well come to a <strong>Joy Villa</strong> near you next fall. (Wow, can’t believe this guy is co-signing a person dragging the American flag on the floor like that. What a shame&#8212;it’s like he doesn’t even respect America anymore, etc.) The designer made a special stop at the end of the runway to kiss Guilfoyle and shake Don’s hand. Who knows what he’s thinking as he smiles down at the designer. My best guess? “She’s going to destroy all of you,” over and over again, forever.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The dirty truth about <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/the-dirty-secret-of-el-chapo-downfall?inline\">El Chapo’s downfall</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; That time <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/brian-rea-modern-love-death-wins-a-goldfish?inline\">death took a break</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The 25 <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/25-best-movie-scenes?inline\">most influential movie scenes</a> of the past 25 years</p>\n<p>&#8212; Acupuncture and hypno-birthing?

Let Koch’s expert on water and chemical regulations decide.","body":"<p>Of all the federal agencies that fall under <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> purview, none embodies the administration’s unofficial mandate to do the exact opposite of its stated mission quite like the Environmental Protection Agency. For the last two years, the E.P.A.&#8212;which, as a reminder, is supposed to be protecting human health and the environment&#8212;has done everything in its power to turn the planet into an ashtray and convince Americans that toxic chemicals are actually totally fine to drink, breathe, and otherwise ingest, all in an effort to help companies secreting those chemicals maximize their profits. Which is to say, we probably should have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/04/former-koch-official-runs-epa-chemical-research-1136230\">seen this one coming</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Trump administration has placed a former Koch Industries official in charge of research that will shape how the government regulates a class of toxic chemicals contaminating millions of Americans’ drinking water&#8212;an issue that could have major financial repercussions for his former employer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Dunlap,</strong> a deputy in E.P.A.’s Office of Research and Development, is playing a key role as the agency decides how to protect people from the pollution left behind at hundreds of military bases and factories across the country. . .He spent the previous eight years as Koch Industries’ lead expert on water and chemical regulations, a position that typically includes helping companies to limit regulatory restrictions and liability for cleanups.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dunlap was hired in October, according to previously undisclosed documents. Since then, he has been extremely busy, having reportedly been involved in high-level meetings that preceded the agency’s decision <em>not</em> to set drinking water limits for chemicals known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which “have been linked with kidney and testicular cancer, as well as other ailments.” (In a statement, <strong>David Ross</strong>, EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Water, told the Hive: “Despite what is being reported, EPA has not finalized or publicly issued its PFAS management plan, and any information that speculates what is included in the plan is premature. The agency is committed to following the Safe Drinking Water Act process for evaluating new drinking water standards, which is just one of the many components of the draft plan that is currently undergoing interagency review.”) According to Politico, Dunlap has been able to avoid a Senate confirmation hearing in which his prior work experience might come up because Trump has not officially nominated anyone to run to office. (Dunlap’s <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/research/david-dunlap\">official bio</a> on the E.P.A. Web site declines to mention any of his employers during his “more than 30 years” working for “private industry, trade associations and as an environmental consultant.”) Currently, Koch subsidiary Georgia-Pacific, a paper and pulp conglomerate, is facing at least one class-action suit related to chemicals now under Dunlap’s purview.</p>\n<p>Koch’s various environmental crimes against humanity are laid out in several high-profile lawsuits over the past 20 years. According to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111005022145/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-02/koch-brothers-flout-law-getting-richer-with-secret-iran-sales.html\">Bloomberg</a>, “Koch Industries was assessed more than $400 million in fines, penalties, and judgments” between 1999 and 2003, such as for dumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of aviation fuel into a Minnesota wetland. “You want an independent, hardheaded scientific review of these issues; you don’t want somebody who is already taking the industry party line,” <strong>Erik Olson,</strong> who heads up the Natural Resources Defense Council’s public health work, told Politico. “There’s a legitimate threat there and, from my perspective, the conflicts of interest that [Dunlap] has having worked as a regulatory compliance director at Georgia-Pacific raises questions about whether he can make those objective decisions or should be recused.”</p>\n<p>Dunlap, of course, is unlikely to be replaced by someone without a host of conflicts of interest given that the guy currently running the E.P.A., <strong>Andrew Wheeler,</strong> is a walking, talking conflict of interest, having <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/07/06/626525274/get-to-know-andrew-wheeler-ex-coal-lobbyist-with-inside-track-to-lead-epa\">served as a coal-lobbyist</a> prior to taking over the top job from departed Grift King <strong>Scott Pruitt.</strong> It is, in other words, par for the course.

The president showed up about 40 minutes late to his planned speech Friday morning in the Rose Garden and immediately began rambling about trade negotiations with China. He proceeded to go on a long tangent about trade, Brexit, Syria, and his plans for a second summit with North Korea’s <strong>Kim Jong Un,</strong> all without the use of a teleprompter. Eventually he got to the point. “I’m going to be signing a national emergency,” Trump said. According to White House officials, the declaration will allow Trump to redirect $3.6 billion from the military, $2.5 billion from counter-narcotics programs, and $600 million from the Treasury to build a border wall that Congress refused to fund.</p>\n<p>Trump appeared resigned to being sued for what both Democrats and Republicans have denounced as an unconstitutional power grab. “We will have a national emergency, and we will then be <em>sued,</em>” he explained, breaking into a strange sing-song voice. “And they will sue us in the Ninth <em>Circuit,</em> even though it <em>shouldn’t</em> be there, and we will possibly get a bad <em>ruling,</em> and then we’ll get another bad <em>ruling,</em> and then we’ll end up in the Supreme <em>Court,</em> and hopefully we’ll get a fair <em>shake,</em> and we’ll win in the Supreme <em>Court</em> just like the <em>ban.</em>”</p>\n<p>The government lawyers who will inevitably have to argue that case were surely appalled by what came next. “We have so much money. But on the wall, they skimped,” he said, complaining that Congress had not given him the $5.7 billion in funding he wanted. “I didn’t need to do this,” he added, potentially undermining any legal justification for an emergency declaration. “But I’d rather do it much faster.”</p>\n<p>It is hard to capture in text the utter strangeness of the entire incoherent, self-defeating monologue. As always with Trump, the <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?457952-1/president-trump-sign-national-emergency-build-border-wall&amp;vod&amp;start=34\">full video</a> needs to be seen to be believed. But for those who can’t bring themselves to watch 50 minutes of the president praising himself and berating reporters, here are the most absurd highlights:</p>\n<p><strong>On other emergency declarations:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s been signed many times before. It’s been signed by other presidents. From 1977 or so, it gave the presidents the power. There’s rarely been a problem. They sign it; nobody cares. I guess they weren’t very exciting. But nobody cares. They sign it for far less important things in some cases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On executing drug dealers:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[In China] a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty. Our . . . drug dealer gets a thing called, “How about a fine?” . . .  So if we want to get smart, we can get smart. You can end the drug problem&#8212;can end it a lot faster than you think.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On Paul Ryan, who advised him against focusing on the wall:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will tell you, I’m very disappointed at certain people&#8212;particularly one&#8212;for not having pushed this faster.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On his biggest conservative fans:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Look, <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do. Not of me. If I change my views, he wouldn&#39;t be with me. <strong>Rush Limbaugh:</strong> I think he’s a great guy. Here’s a guy who could speak for three hours without a phone call. Try doing that sometime. For three hours, he speaks. He’s got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world. I mean, this guy is unbelievable. Try speaking for three hours without taking calls. Taking calls is easy. “O.K., I&#39;ll answer this one, that one.” He goes for three hours and he’s got an audience that’s fantastic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On his friendship with dictator Kim Jong Un:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was a very tough dialogue at the beginning. Fire and fury. Total annihilation. “My button is bigger than yours” and “my button works.” . . . [But] I like him a lot and he likes me a lot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On Ann Coulter, who has called his emergency declaration a scam:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ann Coulter,</strong> I don’t know her. I hardly know her. I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year. but the press loves saying “Ann Coulter.” Probably if I did speak to her, she’d be very nice. I just don’t have the time . . . I would speak to her, I have nothing against her. . . . But she&#39;s off the reservation. But anybody that knows her understands that. But I haven’t spoken to her. I don’t follow her. I don’t talk to her. But the press loves to bring up the name “Ann Coulter.” And you know what, I think she’s fine. . . . I just don’t speak to her.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On where he gets his (debunked) statistics on immigration:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I get my numbers from a lot of sources, like Homeland Security, primarily. And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster. And you know what else is a disaster? The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, <strong>Kirstjen [Nielsen],</strong> for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration. Billions and billions of dollars a month. Billions and billions of dollars and it’s unnecessary. . . . I use many stats . . . you have stats far worse than the ones I use, but I use many stats. But I also use Homeland Security.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On why he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, Part I:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think the people understand what we do. . . . Prime Minister <strong>[Shinzō] Abe</strong> [gave me]&#8212;it’s the most beautiful five-page letter. Nobel Prize. He sent it to them. You know why? Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan. And they had alarms going off&#8212;you know that. Now, all of a sudden, they feel good. They feel safe. I did that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On why he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, Part II:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you look at Idlib Province in Syria, I stopped the slaughter of perhaps three million people, nobody talk about that. . . . Russia and Iran and Syria were going to go in and perhaps destroy three million people in order to get 45,000 terrorists. And I heard about it from a woman who had her parents and her brother living there. And she said, “Please, please.” And I thought&#8212;I said, “No. It can’t happen. What are you talking about it?” “No, they’re going to. ” And I come home and I read a certain paper where the story was there, that they were actually forming to go into&#8212;to, really, to really do big destruction. And I put out a statement that, “You’d better not do it.” And in all fairness to Russia and Iran and Syria, they didn’t attack. Or they’re doing it surgically, at least. Saved a lot of people.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

troops depart.","promoDek":"America’s allies “unanimously” declined the Trump administration’s request to pick up the slack in Syria when U.S. troops depart.","body":"<p>Yet again, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has jumped the gun. Last week, the Trump administration revealed plans to remove all American troops from Syria by the end of April&#8212;a position long championed by the president. The move rankled even some congressional allies like Senator <strong>Lindsey Graham,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">apparently</a> made his displeasure known to Acting Defense Secretary <strong>Patrick Shanahan</strong> over the weekend. Now, it’s clear lawmakers weren’t the only ones blindsided by the planned withdrawal&#8212;key United States allies appear to have been left out of the loop as well.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/allies-say-they-wont-remain-in-syria-after-us-troops-withdraw/2019/02/20/62e503b2-3532-11e9-a400-e481bf264fdc_story.html?utm_term=.9c6870c65501\">reported</a> that U.S. allies “unanimously” declined the Trump administration’s request to pick up the slack fighting ISIS in Syria if the U.S. removes its troops in the spring, as Trump has apparently directed Shanahan to do. A senior administration official told the <em>Post</em> that allies have made it clear they “won’t stay if you pull out.” Trump’s hasty move, then, could leave behind a powder keg. “It’s not safe to leave these enemies there, without any referee or mediating force,” said a U.S. official.</p>\n<p>His approach to Syria is the latest example of Trump’s seeming tendency to push policy without working out the details, which has frustrated even some of his closest allies. “That’s the dumbest fucking idea I’ve ever heard,” Graham evidently <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">told</a> Shanahan of Trump’s withdrawal plan in a meeting in Munich last Saturday. The South Carolina Republican, normally a staunch defender of the president, has been venting about the administration’s Syria policy since December, when Trump suddenly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/donald-trump-syria-troops\">announced</a> it would be up to other nations to fight ISIS there&#8212;despite also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1075397797929775105\">claiming</a> that the terrorist organization had been “defeated.” Graham torched the policy, saying at the time that he would “hold the administration accountable for this decision,” and threatened hearings over the planned move.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to imagine that any president would wake up and make this kind of decision with this little communication,” Republican Senator <strong>Bob Corker</strong> said at the time.</p>\n<p>But it appears that’s precisely how Trump has approached one of the most complicated foreign-policy conundrums of his presidency. While the commander-in-chief seemingly continues to talk out of his ass&#8212;on Friday, he said he would announce the “eradication of the caliphate . . . over the next 24 hours,” but no such announcement has come&#8212;U.S. allies appear to be losing patience. Last week, French Foreign Minister <strong>Jean-Yves Le Drian</strong> <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/u-s-pullout-from-syria-benefits-iran-says-french-fm-1.6938647\">called</a> Trump’s call for withdrawal a “mystery,” and British Foreign Secretary <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> has said that “there is no prospect of British forces replacing the Americans” in Syria. Their pushback has left Trump hanging. Whether it will be enough to force him to reconsider remains to be seen.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a

Trump’s</strong> efforts to build a Trump Tower in Russia during the presidential campaign, <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> appeared Friday on ABC to downplay the controversial real-estate project&#8212;and put some distance between herself and the president. Asked by <strong>Abby Huntsman</strong> whether she had any concerns about the project, the senior White House adviser <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/08/politics/ivanka-trump-russia-investigation/index.html\">responded</a> that she knew “literally almost nothing” about a Trump Organization proposal to build a skyscraper in downtown Moscow, and said she had “zero concern” that anyone in her family could be implicated in <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> investigation into Russian efforts to fix the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Of course, Ivanka’s account differs somewhat from various reports suggesting she knew a great deal about the project. According to <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/mueller-eyes-ivanka-don-jr-s-work-trump-tower-moscow-003012099.html\">Yahoo News</a>, both she and <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong> were involved in the project as far back as 2013, and were aware that former Trump lawyer <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> had been working to revive the deal. In October 2015, Trump Sr. signed a letter of intent to move forward with negotiations, but has continued to be evasive about the extent of his ambitions. In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress about the scope of the Trump Tower project, and BuzzFeed News recently reported that the president directed Cohen to say that those negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did, though the special counsel’s office issued an unusual statement disputing the BuzzFeed story as “not accurate.”</p>\n<p>According to the contested BuzzFeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation\">report</a>, both Ivanka and Trump Jr. received “regular, detailed updates” about the project from Cohen. Ivanka would reportedly have managed a spa at the tower, and per BuzzFeed, instructed Cohen to speak with a Russian athlete who had “synergy on a government level” to move the project along. A spokesperson for the First Daughter’s attorney told BuzzFeed that she was only “minimally involved” in proceedings, and “did not know about this proposal until after a non-binding letter of intent had been signed.” Her older brother, meanwhile, has testified under oath that he was only “peripherally aware” of the plans.</p>\n<p>She contested the Yahoo report too, insisting that her involvement in the project was limited to recommending an architect. But in her interview with Huntsman, she offered additional explanations: the Moscow deal was one of many she was juggling, she was too busy to have paid much attention, and it never moved beyond a theoretical stage. “There was never a binding contract,” she told Huntsman during the <em>Good Morning America</em> interview, part of which aired Friday. “I never talked to the&#8212;with a third party outside of the organization about it. It was one of&#8212;I mean, we could have had 40 or 50 deals like that, that were floating around, that somebody was looking at. Nobody visited it to see if it was worth our time. So this was not exactly like an advanced project.”</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing there, yet it’s created weeks and weeks and months of headlines,” she added. “So no, I have zero concern.”</p>\n<h3>More

Chief among them, of course, have been Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-attacks-obstruction-investigation.html\">1,200 or so</a> public attacks on individuals and groups connected to inquiries into potential collusion between his campaign and Russia. (Trump has called <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> investigation a “witch hunt” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=witch%20hunt%20from%3Arealdonaldtrump&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en\">dozens of times on Twitter</a>; other times he just blurts “witch hunt!” without any context whatsoever.) There’s also the time he <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/donald-trump-fires-fbi-director-james-comey\">fired</a> the director of the F.B.I.; the private campaign to remove <strong>Jeff Sessions</strong> for failing to “protect him”; and the hiring of <strong>Rudy Giuliani,</strong> whose job has been to wage a public-relations war to “undermine the credibility of both Mr. Mueller and the Justice Department,” which has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/rudy-giuliani-robert-mueller-collusion-russia\">not worked out so well</a>. More recently, the president apparently used some precious hours of “Executive Time” to try to install a friendly face atop the investigation into his hush-money payments during the election.</p>\n<p>Last year, according to the <em>Times,</em> Trump summoned his newly installed acting attorney general, <strong>Matthew Whitaker</strong>&#8212;the one he claimed to not know despite <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/trump-denies-knowing-whitaker-who-he-met-a-dozen-times.html\">meeting with him on at least 12 separate occasions</a>&#8212;to ask him a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1068442531887632384\">very legal and very cool</a> question. Could <strong>Geoffrey Berman,</strong> the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, take over the investigation into <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-played-central-role-in-hush-payoffs-to-stormy-daniels-and-karen-mcdougal-1541786601\">Trump’s role</a> in paying porn star <strong>Stormy Daniels</strong> and former <em>Playboy</em> model <strong>Karen McDougal</strong> to keep quiet about their alleged affairs? In Berman, Trump obviously saw the perfect guy for the job, given his background as the son of a real-estate developer; his time <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/10/top-ny-prosecutor-geoffrey-berman-trump-appointee-recused-michael-cohen-inquiry/502367002/\">as a principal at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/rudy-giuliani-greenberg-traurig-resignation\">which previously employed Giuliani until the association likely became too mortifying to bear</a>; and his <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-thought-hed-picked-his-perfect-us-attorney-in-geoffrey-berman-he-was-very-wrong\">hefty donation to the Trump campaign in 2016</a>. In Whitaker, too, Trump presumably saw a guy with a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/matthew-whitaker-world-patent-marketing-scam\">somewhat elastic view of right and wrong</a>, who would be eager to do his bidding. But alas! It was not to be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Whitaker, who had privately told associates that part of his role at the Justice Department was to “jump on a grenade” for the president, knew he could not put Mr. Berman in charge because Mr. Berman had already recused himself from the investigation. The president soon soured on Mr. Whitaker, as he often does with his aides, and complained about his inability to pull levers at the Justice Department that could make the president’s many legal problems go away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The revelation not only highlights Trump’s continued reliance on <em>Sopranos</em>-esque tactics while working in the White House, but also puts Whitaker in an awkward situation vis-à-vis potentially lying to Congress:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Whitaker, who this month told a congressional committee that Mr. Trump had never pressured him over the various investigations, is now under scrutiny by House Democrats for possible perjury.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A spokeswoman for the Justice Department told the <em>Times</em> that the White House never asked Whitaker to interfere in the hush-money investigation. “Under oath to the House Judiciary Committee, then-Acting Attorney General Whitaker stated that ‘at no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel’s investigation or any other investigation,’” said <strong>Kerri Kupec.</strong> “Mr. Whitaker stands by his testimony.” Meanwhile, it will undoubtedly shock you to hear that Trump has dubbed the whole thing “fake news”:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962\">https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962</a></p></blockquote></div><h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Storms’-a-brewin","socialTitle":"Report: Trump Tried to Muzzle Investigation into His Porno Payoffs","socialDescription":"The president thought he could install a friendly face atop the probe.

href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/congress-reaches-deal-to-fund-quarter-of-trump-border-wall\">border-security deal</a> a bipartisan panel of Capitol Hill negotiators struck late Monday, despite the fact that it allots the president <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/12/18221468/congress-border-security-deal\">less money</a> in barrier funding than he was offered last year, before he shut down the government for five weeks. The president has made clear he’s no fan of the agreement, but with no Republican appetite for a second shutdown or unilateral action by the White House, and a Friday deadline looming, he may not have much of a choice&#8212;even as he leaves open the possibility of finding “other sources” to get the sum he’s spent months demanding. “I’m not happy about it,” Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/12/trump-meeting-cant-say-happy-border-deal-remarks-ip-vpx.cnn\">told reporters</a> of the deal on Tuesday. “It’s not doing the trick. But I’m adding things to it, and when you add whatever I have to add&#8212;it’s all gonna happen where we’re gonna build a beautiful, big, strong wall.”</p>\n<p>“It’s very simple,” he said.</p>\n<p>It makes sense that Trump isn’t thrilled about the deal. It includes just $1.375 billion for border fencing&#8212;far less than the nearly $6 billion he’d been seeking to build a concrete wall, and less even than the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/418507-schumer-dems-oppose-spending-more-than-16b-on-border-security\">$1.6 billion</a> <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> had offered him before Trump shut down the government last year. For the guy who authored <em>Art of the Deal,</em> it’s unquestionably a defeat&#8212;a fact his base has already picked up on. Rep. <strong>Mark Meadows,</strong> one of Trump’s top Hill allies, said on Monday that the bill “does not represent a fraction of what the president has promised the American people” and suggested he shouldn’t sign it. <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> Trump’s Fox News id, called the funding measure a “garbage compromise” when details first emerged.</p>\n<p>But Hannity has since softened, saying he’s “not as concerned” about Trump signing what he’d previously described as an “insane” deal&#8212;as long as he also declares a national emergency to get the rest of the money for the wall. “The president would need to declare a national emergency,” Hannity <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2019/02/12/sean-hannity-says-declaring-national-emergency-border-necessity/222852\">said</a> Tuesday. “This is the time. That is a necessity.” Trump, too, has hinted that he could pull additional cash from “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1095469449052868610\">other sources</a>,” a possible reference to the nuclear option he’s been threatening for weeks. “Was just presented the concept and parameters of the Border Security Deal by hard working Senator <strong>Richard Shelby,</strong>” Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1095469447933059073\">tweeted</a> Tuesday evening. “Looking over all aspects knowing that this will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources. . . . Regardless of Wall money, it is being built as we speak!”</p>\n<p>There is more than one way for the White House to tap those “other sources,” although each comes with potential legal hurdles. As Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/11/mick-mulvaney-border-wall-funds-1163996\">reported</a> on Monday, the White House has already developed plans to redirect unspent federal dollars as part of an executive order that would bypass Congress without requiring an emergency declaration. “There are certain sums of money that are available to the president, to any president,” Chief of Staff <strong>Mick Mulvaney</strong> explained Sunday on <em>Meet the Press.</em> “So you comb through the law at the president&#39;s request . . . And there’s pots of money where presidents, all presidents, have access to without a national emergency.” Experts say the move would almost certainly provoke a challenge.</p>\n<p>For now, at least, Trump’s signature on the bipartisan border deal would avert another destructive shutdown. But it’s not a done deal just yet. While the funding measure was agreed to in principle, Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2019/02/13/is-the-border-wall-deal-in-danger-of-falling-apart-392261\">reported</a> Wednesday that lawmakers have discovered some unresolved areas of contention as they’ve worked to finalize it. That could be troublesome with a Friday deadline fast approaching&#8212;especially when the ultimate decision comes down to an unpredictable president whose whims can change with the wind.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

Republicans’ grip on the federal purse strings, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is set to bypass Congress and use the nuclear option to build his long-promised wall at the United States-Mexico border. It’s a move that will trigger a tough, protracted legal fight&#8212;and one that could even cause a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/trump-declares-national-emergency-border-wall-funding\">rift within the G.O.P.</a>, where leadership previously warned the president against an emergency declaration.</p>\n<p>Democrats, naturally, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/national-emergency-blocked-courts-temporarily-doj-warns-white/story?id=61086962\">labeled</a> the move “crazy,” “ridiculous,” and something “all of us will come to regret.” But Thursday also saw renewed cries of alarm from Republicans. Senator <strong>Susan Collins,</strong> who has criticized Trump in the past, released a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorCollins/status/1096175131733475330\">statement</a> calling the administration’s plan B a “mistake.” “Such a declaration would undermine the role of Congress and the appropriations process,” Collins said, warning of the precedent it could set. Kentucky Senator <strong>Rand Paul,</strong> a proponent of limited government, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096149684840738816\">told a reporter</a> he was “not in favor” of the plan, saying that “revenue raising and spending power was given to Congress” and suggesting that going around lawmakers would be an abuse of executive power. And Alaska Senator <strong>Lisa Murkowski,</strong> who’s stood up to the administration before, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096151375875133440\">said</a> she “[doesn’t] think this is a matter that should be declared a national emergency.”</p>\n<p>“I wish he wouldn’t have done it,” Senator <strong>Chuck Grassley</strong> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/14/gop-national-emergency-declaration-trump-1170697\">told</a> Politico. “I imagine we’ll find out whether he’s got the authority to do it by the courts.”</p>\n<p>“I never thought that was a good idea,” Republican Senator <strong>Pat Toomey</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096153688681467905\">told a reporter</a>. “I still don’t.”</p>\n<p>Trump had long suggested he’d employ the nuclear option, having previously called the bipartisan talks that led to this week’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/congress-reaches-deal-to-fund-quarter-of-trump-border-wall\">border-security agreement</a> a “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/trump-great-negotiator-gives-up-on-negotiating-border-wall-national-emergency\">waste of time</a>.” He’d even <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/republicans-think-trump-nuclear-option-national-emergency-is-a-terrible-idea\">implied</a> that he would declare a national emergency during his State of the Union address earlier this month, but ultimately decided against it amid bipartisan backlash&#8212;including from Senate Majority Leader <strong>Mitch McConnell.</strong></p>\n<p>Now, though, Trump is planning to sign the bipartisan deal <em>and</em> employ the nuclear option. That will likely please his base, including <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> who signaled this week that the only way he’d give his blessing to the “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-prepares-to-sign-garbage-compromise-on-border-wall-funding\">garbage compromise</a>” would be if the president accompanied his signature with a national emergency. It’ll also please some of his Capitol Hill allies, including <strong>Lindsey Graham,</strong> who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GarrettHaake/status/1096144722215743489\">said</a> Thursday that “this is a political fight worth having.”</p>\n<p>It remains to be seen whether pushback from lawmakers can overcome the kudos from Trump’s base. That, after all, is one of the defining problems of Republican criticisms of Trump: that his detractors, time and again, have proven far more pliable than his allies. McConnell, who had previously opposed the nuclear option, announced his support on the Senate floor Thursday. And even those who expressed concern with the maneuver seemingly left themselves wiggle room. Take <strong>Marco Rubio:</strong> the Florida Republican indicated he believes Trump may be violating the Constitution if he bypasses Congress to build the wall&#8212;but only went so far as to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenRubioPress/status/1096172609392254978\">say</a> he is “skeptical it will be something [he] can support.” “I will wait to see what statutory or constitutional power the President relies on to justify such a declaration before making any definitive statement,” he said.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and

But in declaring a national emergency, the president risks a constitutional challenge&#8212;and causing lasting damage to the institution of Congress.","body":"<p>President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> will declare a national emergency to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, the White House confirmed Thursday afternoon, shortly after Senate Majority Leader <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> strode onto the Senate floor to announce that he would support the president’s power grab. “President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action&#8212;including a national emergency&#8212;to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis,” Press Secretary <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Trump had <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-wall-national-emergency-shutdown\">long threatened</a> to use his executive authority to build the wall if Democrats refused to give him the $5.7 billion he had demanded, despite the protestations of lawmakers in his own party. McConnell himself <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/mcconnell-privately-cautioned-trump-about-emergency-declaration-on-border-wall/2019/02/01/5ff1262c-2646-11e9-81fd-b7b05d5bed90_story.html\">previously warned</a> the president against declaring a national emergency, concerned it would split the Republican Party. In <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-01/trump-hints-he-ll-discuss-border-emergency-at-state-of-union\">recent days</a>, Trump reportedly convened his staff and advisers to begin drafting a national-emergency declaration for the wall, as it became clear that the omnibus budget would not include money for his signature campaign promise; the latest iteration allocated just $1.375 billion for 55 miles of barriers, fencing, and other security measures. Conservatives, including some of Trump’s top allies on Capitol Hill, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-prepares-to-sign-garbage-compromise-on-border-wall-funding\">panned the deal</a>. Fox News host <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> perhaps the president’s most influential outside adviser, called it a “garbage compromise.”</p>\n<p>The president’s inability to build the wall, even when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, has been a continuing personal embarrassment. By declaring a national emergency, Trump can appease his base and save face&#8212;but he also risks a massive court battle. The move will likely trigger a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/01/trump-has-no-case-national-emergency/581356/\">constitutional challenge</a>, as it directly circumvents Congress’s power of the purse to address an emergency wholly manufactured by the president. Despite Trump’s insistence that there is a crisis at the border, illegal border crossings are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/11/us/politics/trump-border-crisis-reality.html\">down substantially</a> over the last two decades. While there is a very real <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-theres-a-crisis-at-the-border-heres-what-the-data-says\">asylum crisis</a> at the border, the vast majority of people seeking refuge in the United States, such as members of several recent “caravans,” typically present themselves at ports of entry in order to apply for protected status.</p>\n<p>Legal experts believe <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/trump-national-emergency.html?module=inline\">Trump could win</a> a court challenge over his authority to militarize border-wall construction, and the White House has been preparing for that eventuality. Asked Thursday if they are prepared to litigate a national-emergency declaration, Sanders said, “We’re very prepared, but there shouldn’t be [legal challenges]. The president’s doing his job. Congress should do theirs.”</p>\n<p>The larger problem identified by Republican critics is the precedent Trump would set by usurping Congress. After all, if Trump can decide that something qualifies as an emergency when he doesn’t get his way, what’s to stop a future Democratic president from deciding that something like climate change&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">an actual, global threat to humanity</a>&#8212;can be addressed by executive fiat? Trump himself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/535441553079431168\">tweeted</a> in 2014, “Repubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit &amp; because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, shortly after Sanders confirmed Trump’s intent to declare an emergency, House Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> issued a stark warning to Republicans. “Just think what a president with different values can present to the American people,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/politico/status/1096153922228703233\">she said</a> during a press conference Thursday. “You want to talk about a national emergency? Let’s talk about today, the one-year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America. That’s a national emergency. Why don’t you declare that an emergency, Mr. President? I wish you would, but a Democratic president can do that. A Democratic president can declare other emergencies as well.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Emergency Wall","socialTitle":"Trump Chooses the Nuclear Option to Build His Border Wall","socialDescription":"The president hopes to save face after a stinging legislative defeat.

One stop on his itinerary is likely to steal the show.","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>This weekend, <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> will board a military plane and embark on a six-country trip to present foreign diplomats with part of his long-awaited proposal to solve an epic quandary and bring peace to the Middle East. Kushner has said that he and the other members of the trip, including Middle East envoy <strong>Jason Greenblatt,</strong> State Department policy adviser <strong>Brian Hook,</strong> and deputy assistant to the president <strong>Avi Berkowitz,</strong> will not present the full peace plan until after the Israeli elections in April. Instead, they will gauge support for various economic incentives in the proposal, including foreign aid for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. These enticements are intended to persuade Palestinian officials to seek a broader deal.</p>\n<p>Over the course of seven days, Kushner’s team will travel to Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey. They will also make a stop in Saudi Arabia, where Kushner plans to meet with Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman.</strong> It will be the first time the two will meet since 15 Saudis brutally strangled <em>Washington Post</em> journalist Jamal Khashoggi and dismembered him with a bone saw last fall.</p>\n<p>Kushner and M.B.S., as he is known, struck up a relationship nearly two years ago, when the Saudi prince visited the White House. Kushner and M.B.S., youthful heirs with complex family rivalries, have met a handful of times since. For a while, it was a mutually beneficial alliance. M.B.S. provided Kushner with a key ally and envoy in the region. Kushner, in turn, convinced his father-in-law to make Riyadh his first stop on a sweeping presidential tour of the Middle East, and helped promote an arms deal between the United States and the kingdom. But their bond came under great scrutiny last fall, after the assassination of Khashoggi.</p>\n<p>In the days following, Kushner reached out to M.B.S as the administration launched its investigation, and urged him to be as transparent as possible. (The C.I.A. later concluded that M.B.S. ordered the operation, although the Saudi government has denied the crown prince played any role in the killing.) In a rare town-hall interview with CNN in October, Kushner offered a chilling realpolitik explanation for the administration’s failure to condemn the Saudis. “We have to be able to work with our allies,” he said. “The Middle East is a rough place. It’s been a rough place for a very long time, and we have to be able to pursue our strategic objectives, but we also have to deal with what obviously seems to be a terrible situation.”</p>\n<p>The uncomfortable optics of the meeting are not lost on those planning the road show. But Kushner is meeting with the heads of states from the region, a person familiar with the trip explained, and M.B.S. is a head of state. Indeed, Saudi Arabia appears to be the lynchpin of Kushner’s unprecedented strategy to forge lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Whereas past administrations sought to negotiate with both parties, the Trump White House is hoping to assemble a coalition of Gulf states aligned against Iran to exert influence in the region.</p>\n<p>The whirlwind tour will come on the heels of a two-day conference in Warsaw last week, during which Kushner met with leaders from 60 countries and obliquely discussed the plan. Israeli Prime Minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu,</strong> who was in attendance during Kushner’s closed-door presentation, reportedly <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/israel-gulf-states-commend-kushners-peace-effort-11550182508\">congratulated</a> him for being “crazy enough” to “come up with ideas” to resolve the conflict. A foreign-affairs minister from Saudi Arabia also offered support for Kushner’s plan, according to <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Palestinian officials, who have not engaged in peace talks since the U.S. moved its embassy to Jerusalem, did not attend the conference. On Friday, Kushner, the grandson of Holocaust survivors, joined Vice President <strong>Mike Pence</strong> at Auschwitz-Birkenau, before they flew to Germany for the weekend to attend the Munich Security Conference. Kushner’s wife, <strong>Ivanka Trump,</strong> also made the trip.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Much has been said recently, both inside and outside the White House, about Jared and Ivanka’s influence within the Trump administration. The couple survived a series of power struggles with <strong>Steve Bannon, Sean Spicer, Reince Priebus,</strong> and finally <strong>John Kelly.</strong> With the West Wing thinned out, aides have been referring to Kushner as the de facto chief of staff, one person close to the couple told me. But it’s not that Jared or Ivanka have more power as a result of others leaving. It’s that Trumpworld is finally beginning to understand the extent of the power they’ve had all along. “They’ve always been son and daughter of a president who is a famously familial person,” this person said. “The people who misunderstood that are no longer there. Everything takes time, and they have the luxury of time in this administration when most other people do not.”</p>\n<p>Trump, of course, is most comfortable when the West Wing is operating as a family office. It was how he ran his business in Trump Tower, and it remains the best way to assess who has staying power. It also helps to explain why, despite an anti-nepotism law that stood for 50 years, he deputized his son-in-law to lead some of the most significant foreign-policy initiatives of his administration, and why his daughter frequently represents the administration on trips abroad. While the rest of the White House is in a state of constant turnover, Kushner remains firmly ensconced in a closet of an office near the Oval. Ivanka has a sunny corner room just upstairs, outside of which hangs a blown-up photo of her and Kushner dancing onstage at inauguration, with a note from her dad scrawled out in gold Sharpie, saying how proud of them he was.</p>\n<p>They still worry about how they are portrayed in the media, though the negative press has slowed as their antagonists have left the White House. When Ivanka sat down with ABC for an interview earlier this year, she was caught off guard by questions she thought had been deemed off-limits, according to two people familiar with the situation. But as time has gone on, Jared and Ivanka, like everyone else, have cared less and less about about each individual story. The country, after all, has reached a late stage of Trump fatigue. Though news cameras panned to take in Ivanka’s stony expression in Munich when German chancellor <strong>Angela Merkel</strong> criticized her father’s foreign policy, the schadenfreude was fleeting. Back in New York, their social circle is similarly dazed. One former friend of the couple shrugged when NBC News <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/officials-rejected-jared-kushner-top-secret-security-clearance-were-overruled-n962221\">reported</a> that Kushner had only gotten his security clearance restored after a Trump appointee overrode the recommendation of career White House security specialists. “Tomorrow, no one is going to talk about this,” this person said. “Is anything ever going to stick?”</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Middle East","socialTitle":"Jared Kushner Is Preparing for Another Face-to-Face Meeting with M.B.S.","socialDescription":"Kushner is embarking on a six-country tour to begin rolling out his Middle East peace plan.

The more famous members of the bunch include <strong>Tamar Braxton</strong> and <em>Real Housewives of Atlanta</em> star <strong>Kandi Burruss,</strong> as well as <strong>Joey Lawrence</strong> and <em>Mean Girls</em> star <strong>Jonathan Bennett</strong> (a.k.a. Aaron Samuels). Fun!</p>\n<p>Scaramucci is actually the second former White House official to board this show. Last year, <strong>Omarosa Manigault Newman</strong> went back to her reality-TV roots with a quick turn on the series that doubled as <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/02/omarosa-big-brother-exit\">promotion</a> for her then-upcoming Trump tell-all. Scaramucci appears to be crafting his second act in reverse; he released his own Trump-centric book, <em>Trump, the Blue-Collar President,</em> last year.</p>\n<p>Another wrinkle? <strong>Julie Chen Moonves</strong> will be hosting <em>Big Brother</em> once more. Chen previously <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/julie-chen-reportedly-resigns-the-talk\">resigned</a> from her position at <em>The Talk</em> in 2018, after her husband, <strong>Les Moonves,</strong> resigned as CBS chairman following allegations of sexual misconduct. (In a statement at the time, Moonves said, “Untrue allegations from decades ago are now being made against me that are not consistent with who I am.”) But though she left <em>The Talk,</em> Chen Moonves maintained her position at <em>Big Brother</em>&#8212;and will apparently continue to do so this season.</p>\n<p>Of all Trump’s former associates, Scaramucci has, perhaps, been the most visibly keen on continuing to cash in on his brief moment of fame. Last June, he and bombastic attorney <strong>Michael Avenatti</strong> started <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/michael-avenatti-anthony-scaramucci-colbert-late-show\">peddling</a> a debate-based TV show co-starring themselves. It never quite gained traction. The Mooch’s book <em>Blue-Collar President</em> never quite made a <em>Fire and Fury</em>-like splash, either&#8212;perhaps because, you know, he only served in the White House for 11 days. Either way, we’ll see if he’s got any good dish left in him very soon. The new season of <em>Celebrity Big Brother</em> premieres January 21 at 8 P.M.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Don’t call it a Dernaissance, call it <a

Can she shed her Trump baggage? “People don’t stay in Hollywood jail forever,” says one entertainment executive.","body":"<p>In early October, shortly after the newly spun-off Fox media company\nannounced her appointment as chief communications officer, Hope Hicks\nflew to Los Angeles and set up shop at the Century City InterContinental\nto meet with her new counterparts, the Hollywood trade press. During her\nyears flacking for Donald Trump, Hicks had developed a reputation among\npolitical reporters as a fair broker of sorts. Her stoic disposition may\nhave belied an assassin-level fealty to her boss, but she was\nnevertheless polite and competent in a milieu otherwise defined by chaos\nand turbulence. Perhaps more importantly, she had juice.</p>\n<p>Over the years, Hicks had become an ever present Trump appendage, a\nsurrogate daughter, de facto whisperer and translator. She was a\nZelig-like character in the White House telenovela&#8212;a witness in the\nMueller probe, a young woman who admitted to Congress that she had told\n“white lies” on behalf of her boss. She was allegedly party to a\ncampaign relationship, a West Wing fling, Cabinet tribalism, and\nremained, indisputably, one of the most influential voices in the\npresident’s ear. She touched everything but had fingerprints on nothing.\nEveryone and no one knew her. E-mails and phone calls typically began\nwith “Off the record.” She was the elusive person familiar with the\nsituation. And she was familiar with just about every situation.</p>\n<p>More than anything, though, Hicks was an enigma. Not yet 30 years old,\nwas she a neophyte or a calculating and ambitious striver who advanced\nher way up the greasy pole by blithely defending Trump’s\nbehavior&#8212;someone who had willingly stood by him during the Billy Bush\ntape, the Muslim ban, and “Lock her up”? Was she attracted to power,\nor simply quite skilled at managing the most powerful person in the\nroom&#8212;at interpreting his whims for everyone else bewildered by the\nbehavior? Was she in that role because, given her obvious beauty, she\nappeared perfectly “cast” for it, in her boss’s parlance? (According\nto Michael Wolff’s <em>Fire and Fury,</em> Trump referred to Hicks as “the best\npiece of tail” that his former aide Corey Lewandowski, the partner in\nthat alleged campaign tryst with Hicks, would “ever have.”) Or was it\nall sexist bullshit, and was she merely the only competent one in this\nviper’s den of a West Wing?</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed/?pub=vf&amp;articleID=hope-and-change\"><iframe height=\"100\" width=\"350\" src=\"https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed/?pub=vf&amp;articleID=hope-and-change\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>Everyone had a take, it seemed, but no one knew. Hicks, after all, was\nvirtually unknowable. Keeping her boss’s hours, she woke up at four\no’clock in the morning to answer e-mail and exercise. She could run only\ninside, on a treadmill, because she needed to have her two phones in\nfront of her. (Most of her workouts, according to a person familiar with\nthe routine, consisted of running as fast as she could for three minutes\nat a time before the next call came in.) She arrived at the White House\nat 7:30 for a meeting with whoever was chief of staff, and then spent\nvirtually the entire day within earshot of the president. She declined\nto participate in interviews and turned down offers to pose for\nlegendary photographers.</p>\n<p>Among Hollywood reporters, few knew what to expect when Hicks arrived in\nLos Angeles. Many, naturally, had opinions. “All bets were already\nagainst her, because there was an innate disrespect and dislike for the\nwork she did for Trump,” one Hollywood media executive told me,\nreferring to Hicks’s reported role in crafting the president’s infamous\nresponses to Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer in 2016\nand his foreknowledge of the Stormy Daniels payoff, among other things.\n“She’s the person who lied for him and worked for him, and seemed to\nhave no problem with it, and could sleep at night.”</p>\n<p>But given that newsrooms are really just like high-school cafeterias,\nmany had tapped colleagues in Washington and New York for useful gossip.\nA handful of reporters who met Hicks for coffee told me that they were\ninstructed to anticipate someone kind and hardworking. In these\nconversations, Hicks was clear that the job marked a new start for her.\nShe also told the reporters that they should not assume anything about\nher beliefs based on comments espoused by her previous “principal”&#8212;a\nreference to Trump.</p>\n<p>After these conversations, according to numerous people who met with\nher, Hicks seemed saccharine yet somehow sincere. She was also unlike\nany publicist they had ever seen. In Hollywood, beauty is defined by the\nsort of effortless, invisible cool made possible only by a great deal of\neffort and a whole lot of money. Hicks, a former Ralph Lauren model and\na student of the Trump aesthetic, often arrived in black sunglasses,\nblown-out chestnut hair, and a full face of makeup. “It was four P.M.\nwhen I met her, and it was like an alien landed in the middle of Los\nAngeles,” one reporter told me. “That’s not the L.A. vibe. That\ndoesn’t play out here.”</p>\n<p>A few weeks into her job, Hicks found herself in a little hot water.\nSeveral reporters had gotten a tip that longtime Fox executive Gary\nNewman was being relieved of his duties after tense contract\nnegotiations. Newman had wanted a shorter-term deal that would extend\nonly through the Murdoch family’s sale of 21st Century Fox to Disney&#8212;a\n$70-billion-plus mega-merger whose remaining unsold assets, such as Fox\nNews and Fox Sports, would constitute the new Fox entity for which Hicks\nworked. But Fox wanted Newman to sign on to a longer deal. Several\nreporters asked Hicks about Newman, and she insisted that the rumors\nwere untrue and she would let them know if something were to change.\nThings moved faster than she anticipated, though, and on October 19, Fox\ndistributed a press release saying that Newman was out and Charlie\nCollier, an AMC executive, would become head of entertainment for Fox’s\nbroadcasting division.</p>\n<p>In Washington, Hicks may have been able to pull out an excuse for\nreporters&#8212;the situation was fluid, her principal had changed his mind,\net cetera. But in the world of entertainment reporting&#8212;where\njournalists churn less frequently, develop their own soft power, and\nwork on a timeworn barter system&#8212;some felt as if Hicks may have\ncommitted a legitimate foul. “The journalist-publicist relationship in\nthis town is all about the trust in the exchange of information,” the\nreporter explained. “I’ll sit on a story about A-B-C in the short term\nin exchange for X-Y-Z down the line. It’s all about the long-term gain,\nand I don’t think that she got that.”</p>\n<p>Other reporters moved on. It was a fairly minor issue, they told me,\nthat was probably blown out of proportion because most people didn’t\nwant to like her. But the media executive made clear: “You do not lie.\nNot here. You will be run out of town.”</p>\n<p><strong>In some ways,</strong> Hicks has always been better suited for Hollywood than for\nWashington. Raised comfortably in Greenwich, Connecticut, her parents\nmet while working as aides on Capitol Hill. Her father eventually went\non to flack for a tobacco company and, later, for the National Football\nLeague. (Her grandfather handled the P.R. for Texaco during the 1970s\noil crisis.) In sixth grade, at a neighbor’s suggestion, Hicks and her\nsister, Mary Grace, auditioned for a Ralph Lauren campaign and were\nbooked. She posed for Bruce Weber in a campaign for Naturalizer shoes\nand appeared in an episode of <em>Guiding Light</em> and a Nickelodeon program\nabout golf. She auditioned for a part in a movie alongside Alec Baldwin.\nAt 13, she posed for a cover story in <em>Greenwich Magazine,</em> explaining\nthat “if the acting thing doesn’t work out, I could really see myself\nin politics.”</p>\n<p>Around that time, she filmed an audition tape for a kid’s edition of the\nhit show <em>Weakest Link.</em> (On the tape, she performed an improvised rap,\nand offered her best James Bond imitation.) The tape impressed\nexecutives enough that the studio flew her and her mother out to L.A.\nfor a final audition. They spent the days leading up to the meeting\nbeing very “L.A.”&#8212;visiting the store Julia Roberts got kicked out of\nin <em>Pretty Woman,</em> and shopping on Rodeo. Once she arrived at the\naudition, however, reality set in. She did some quick math: there were\neight podiums on set and 10 kids in the room. “You still have to\naudition,” her mom told her, explaining that not everyone at the studio\nwould get selected for the show.</p>\n<p>Hicks, now known for her sangfroid, panicked; she blew the performance.\nIt became somewhat of a running Hicks-household joke for years. Before\nevery job interview or tryouts for sports teams or auditions, her mom\nwould playfully remind her to not “<em>Weakest Link</em>” when it came time.\nHicks never wanted to feel that way again; it gave her a Trump-like\ndrive to win whenever she was reminded of it.</p>\n<p>At Greenwich High School, she lettered in swimming and, like her father\nand sister before her, went on to become captain of the lacrosse team,\nwhich she led to a state championship. To celebrate her graduation, her\nfamily took out a full page in her yearbook with family photos and\nmodeling shots of her and Mary Grace collaged together and the lyrics to\nthe Lovin’ Spoonful’s “Do You Believe in Magic” typed in little black\nletters. “Hope Charlotte Hicks,” it reads at the top. “To the girl\nwith magic in her heart.”</p>\n<div class=\"callout large\" data-type=\"callout\"><p>“She got about as <em>elegant of an exit</em> as anyone could possibly get,”\nsays one Hicks confidant.</p>\n</div><p>Hicks majored in English literature and started the lacrosse team at\nSouthern Methodist University, in Dallas, but stumbled into a circuitous\npath that would lead her to the White House when she joined her father\nat a tailgate event for Super Bowl XLV, in February 2011, in nearby\nArlington. There she met Matthew Hiltzik, a New York public-relations\nexecutive who had worked with Hillary Clinton and Harvey Weinstein at\nMiramax, among others, and whose firm represented Alec Baldwin at the time.\nHiltzik Strategies also managed Ivanka’s burgeoning clothing brand.\nHiltzik would eventually hire Hicks, who was subsequently enlisted to work on\nthe Ivanka account. The two quickly developed a rapport, and Hicks was hired\nat the Trump Organization to handle public relations.</p>\n<p>When Donald Trump announced that he was running for president, Hicks was\n26 and commuting into Manhattan from an apartment she rented with her\nsister in Greenwich. During the campaign, she spent almost a year and a\nhalf living between Trump Force One, as the candidate referred to his\nprivate jet, and a Trump-owned condominium. From the time she woke up,\nat about four o’clock in the morning, until the time she went to bed,\nwhich could be after midnight, her phone vibrated with incoming calls\nand e-mails from reporters, and she answered almost all of\nthem&#8212;because she was the communications staff. After the election, her\nascent to the Trump administration was a certainty. “She’s one of the\npeople who was most candid and most honest with the president, whose\nadvice he valued tremendously,” Ivanka Trump told me. “It’s because\nshe doesn’t opine on issues she hasn’t studied. Any of the roles she’s\nstepped into over the last decade, people would try to argue that she\ndidn’t have qualifications for this or that. But she did so anyway\nbecause she knew her level of intelligence, confidence, work ethic, and\nconviction and ability to jump in. You could literally assign her\nanything and she would be successful.”</p>\n<p>Sure, it was unusual that Hicks had no political experience, but neither\ndid the president and many of his top aides, including his daughter and\nson-in-law, Jared Kushner. Reporters seemed to like her and, eventually,\ngrew to respect her. They also knew that she was umbilically connected\nto her principal. Not only did she sit right outside the president’s\noffice, but she was also in touch with him constantly during the few\nhours they were apart. Often, she would be on the phone with Trump as\nshe hurried through the White House security checkpoint early in the\nmorning. According to someone familiar with the situation, Hicks would\nask the Secret Service agents if she could go through the metal\ndetectors with her cell phone. They didn’t much care who was on the\nline; she would need to follow protocol. “Hang on,” she would tell the\npresident, according to this person. “I’m putting you through the\nconveyor belt.” Then she’d pick right back up talking as she entered\nthe building, where she would see him a few minutes later.</p>\n<p>Over time, however, the schedule and scrutiny, the mix of heightened\nprofessional responsibility and lack of control over her personal life,\nstarted to weigh heavily on Hicks. Close as she and Trump had become, he\ncould blow up her day with a pre-dawn tweet. Hicks also faces the\nprospect of legal bills stemming from the various federal investigations\ninto the campaign. Her entire life played out within a short radius\naround the White House. Hicks considered leaving, and she labored over\nthe rollout of her departure. For a time, Ivanka and Kushner persuaded\nher to stick it out. According to people familiar with her thinking, she\nalso didn’t want to create the impression that one particular news event\nhad hastened her exit. But her departure was unfurled soon after the\npaparazzi discovered that she was dating White House staff secretary Rob\nPorter.</p>\n<p>In late January 2018, Hicks and Porter joined other members of the White\nHouse communications team, including Hogan Gidley and Josh Raffel, who\nhad become Hicks’s closest friend stemming from their time together at\nHiltzik, at Gidley’s apartment. After a subsequent group dinner at Rosa\nMexicano, a photographer with a long lens caught Hicks and Porter\nkissing in the backseat of a taxi on their way home together. EXCLUSIVE:\nWHITE HOUSE ROMANCE! read the <em>Daily Mail</em> headline on the first day of\nFebruary. The plot quickly grew darker after the tabloid published\ninterviews with Porter’s two ex-wives, who claimed that he had\nphysically and verbally abused them. (At the time, Porter called many of\nthe allegations “slanderous and simply false.”)</p>\n<p>“It’s grating on anyone when you come with a group to my apartment and\nthere are pictures of you downstairs when you get in a cab, and there\nare pictures of you when you are in that cab. It’s so much more creepy\nand invasive when the paparazzi is strategically hidden with a telephoto\nzoom lens taking photos from afar&#8212;and that’s what they did to Hope\nevery single day,” Gidley said. “She chose to make her role a\nbehind-the-scenes one and not be an out-front spokesperson ...\nbecause she wanted a level of anonymity. At a human level, she just\nwanted to work hard and live her life without some picture being taken\non every street corner.” By the end of that month, <em>The New York Times</em>\nbroke the news that Hicks was leaving.</p>\n<p>Hicks cried when she told the communications team of her decision.\nGidley, himself emotional, teared up. “I’m ashamed to admit I was\nselfishly upset and upset for the administration, because she was so\nincredibly good at her job,” Gidley said, recalling Hicks laughing\nthrough tears when he told her he didn’t like change. “I should’ve been\nconsoling her, but she came over and hugged me.” Trump did not erupt\nwhen she told him the news; he had expected she would move on someday.\nHe gave her an uncharacteristically kind public send-off. “I consider\nit a skill to leave that White House with an elegant exit,” one person\nwho has advised Hicks professionally told me. “And she got about as\nelegant of an exit that anyone could possibly get.” On her last day,\nshe handed out notes to each staffer in her loopy, girlish penmanship.</p>\n<p><strong>After her departure,</strong> Hicks decamped to Greenwich to recuperate with her\nfamily. For a while, things had been tense in the Hicks house as her\nparents worried about her punishing hours, physical safety, and mounting\nnegative publicity. Initially, it wasn’t easy to transition from the\nfast-twitch, Trump-staffer lifestyle. “You’re used to your phone\nringing every 10 seconds,” a former White House colleague told me,\nexplaining the phenomenon, “and you start to take your phone out of\nyour pocket to check your e-mail, and you say to yourself, Oh, I didn’t\nget an e-mail. And then you check 10 seconds later and, again, you say,\nOh, I didn’t get an e-mail.” She made time for old friends, ran outside\nwithout fear of having both phones in front of her, took some weekend\ntrips out of town.</p>\n<p>Hicks didn’t totally disengage. She monitored the news and kept in touch\nwith Trump, Ivanka, and the White House communications team about\nstories and messaging. She accompanied staffers on a trip aboard Air\nForce One to central Ohio, prompting rumors that she might re-enter the\nWhite House. She was even floated as an outside contender for the\nchief-of-staff position amid the enduring John Kelly drama.</p>\n<p>Speculation was fueled, in part, because the private sector had not been\nkind to Trump alums. Reince Priebus had returned to his former law firm;\nSean Spicer had barely caught on as a Fox News commentator. Rex\nTillerson and Gary Cohn had yet to chart their new courses. Raffel would\nland on his feet at the controversial e-cigarette manufacturer Juul, and\nDina Powell settled back into a larger role at Goldman Sachs than the\none she left before she joined the administration. Hicks solicited\nadvice from Ivanka and Kushner, Powell, Cohn, and Hiltzik, who all\nencouraged her to take meetings. And she did&#8212;sometimes one at\nbreakfast, another at lunch, and then for post-work drinks or for\ndinner. There were opportunities flacking for private-equity firms and\nrepresenting wealthy finance guys. She constantly fielded the suggestion\nthat she go on television. She was attractive and articulate and no one\nknew the administration better, the suggestions went. But Hicks is\nconflict-averse by nature, and the idea of slugging it out on cable news\ndid not appeal to her. Sure, she had opinions and a story to tell, but\nnow did not feel like the right time to use her voice. She considered\nmemorializing her thoughts on paper, perhaps for a book. Nothing has\nbeen formalized yet.</p>\n<p>One adviser told me that Hicks had initial trepidation about whether she\nhad been tarnished by the Trump brand. But Hicks also realized that her\nability to work with Trump made her valuable to a narrow, but lucrative,\nmarket. “She was very deliberate in figuring out what would be right,”\nIvanka told me.</p>\n<p>Months after her departure, she had lunch with a high-profile host of a\npopular Fox News program who had become a friend. He, like many others,\nsuggested that she take a job in TV. When she demurred, he told her she\nshould meet some people at the network anyway. They walked over to the\nFox headquarters on Sixth Avenue, where she met with a few people, who\nfollowed up a couple of weeks later saying that, it so happened, Lachlan\nMurdoch was looking for someone to run communications for New Fox, the\ncompany he was starting once the assets were spun off in the Disney\nsale. The two had lunch at the Sixth Avenue headquarters.</p>\n<p>A person familiar with the hiring process told me that they called White\nHouse reporters, inquiring about what she was like to work with and\nwhether she was strategic. “With me, she had to overcome her\nrelationship with Trump, which was a straight down, not an up,” this\nperson explained. “I wondered if everyone who worked for him was out of\ntheir minds, but all of the reporters I called, from papers that were\npretty tough on the administration, all said she was smart, responsive,\nand had integrity.”</p>\n<p>Around the same time, Trump had a scheduled chat with Rupert Murdoch,\nand he mentioned that Hicks was interviewing for the job and, of course,\nrecommended her. Hicks flew to L.A. for a final round of meetings and\ninterviews. As she had for the audition nearly two decades earlier, her\nmom tagged along for fun, and joked with her not to “<em>Weakest Link</em>” it.\nBy the end of the trip, New Fox offered her the job of communications\ndirector. She thought about it for a few days before she accepted.</p>\n<p>In some ways, New Fox was an easy, familiar choice. It was run by a\nwealthy, occasionally dysfunctional family and traded in a familiar form\nof loudmouth conservatism. “It’s a little bit of Trump-lite,” one\nperson close to her told me. “You can still be a little drunk on the\nKool-Aid.”</p>\n<p>It also seemed oddly manageable given her experience. Hicks’s chief\ntalent is being someone’s barely visible hand. Lachlan Murdoch, who\nwould be her new principal, is not Donald Trump, and New Fox is not the\nTrump Organization or the White House.</p>\n<p>But, in another regard, it was going to be a challenge. In the White\nHouse, technically she answered to the American public, but her job in\nthe West Wing was always about serving her audience of one. Running\ncommunications for a public company, where you answer to shareholders\nand are constantly held accountable by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and no-fucks-to-give veteran reporters, is a\ntruth-elasticity-free zone. White lies are possibly fireable offenses.</p>\n<p>But the job offered one undeniable advantage. It was in a place where\nlong-lens photographers would stake out other, far more famous young\nwomen, outside the psychic mindlock of the Acela corridor. Hicks was\nhesitant to move so far from her family. But her relationship with\nPorter had ended months before; she had no long-term lease on an\napartment. She decided to follow her new principal. “I don’t think she\nwas looking one way or another to move or not to move,” one longtime\nclose friend explained. “But it was an opportunity. It was a fresh\nstart.” She joked with friends that her parents wanted her to have a\nhealthy relationship, so she decided to move to L.A.</p>\n<p><strong>The sun still</strong> had not fully broken through the late-fall darkness when a\ntwentysomething woman in a neon sports bra and black Lululemons cranked\nup an old Chris Brown remix and pulled down a set of multi-colored\nresistance bands suspended from the ceiling. The boutique fitness\nstudio, heated to well over 90 degrees, was filled with a half-dozen\nyoung women who were there to bounce about the springy, wide-paneled\nwood floor, pull down those bands with their lithe, twiggy arms, and\nlift their ankles strapped with 1.5-pound weights about a million times\nin a row while the remixes blasted. On any given morning, Gwyneth\nPaltrow or Jennifer Lopez or Tracee Ellis Ross could have been there.</p>\n<p>That morning, though, there were no <em>celebrity</em> celebrities. There was one\nwoman in the back row, though, in a navy moisture-wicking turtleneck and\na headband, as if she were dressed for a brisk winter run at Deerfield.\nTo be fair, it is unlikely that anyone would have expected to see Hicks\nin a dance cardio class fit for Hollywood starlets at six o’clock in the\nmorning. That is the beauty of Hollywood for Hicks. No one\nbatted an eye when she went to dinner at Spago at the end of the year,\nbecause Oprah was at a table behind her. (Her mom pleaded with her to go\nup to the mega-star. “Go tell her you’ll run her 2020 campaign!” she\nteased. Hicks did not, but she did take a not-so-great photo of her on\nher cell phone.) No one paid attention to her when she attended a Drake\nconcert, or spent an afternoon at Universal Studios. When she walked\ninto the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel for coffee one November\nmorning&#8212;reveling in the plaids of her Greenwich youth&#8212;no one in the\nplace looked her way. Hicks didn’t check her phone during the entirety\nof the class, which ended near midday on the East Coast. There was no\nfear of a missed call or tweet, a new fresh hell.</p>\n<p>Hicks still wakes up at four A.M., though more out of habit than\nnecessity. She has not once turned on the television in her apartment,\naccording to someone familiar with her new routine, and opted against\ninstalling one in her office. She reads the paper in print leisurely in\nthe morning, and listens to audiobooks at home and on her commute to\nwork. Once she gets to the office, around nine A.M., she, like her\nformer boss, will make notes on paper copies of stories and send them,\nsnail mail, to her family, or to people in the administration who might\nget ideas about speeches or policy positions. She tells her assistant to\nkeep the first hour of her day free, her own executive time.</p>\n<p>Most days, she is home by six P.M., and is content to keep to herself,\nat least for now. She never mingled much with the Washington set or\nreporters in a social way when she was on the campaign or in the White\nHouse, and so far her life in Los Angeles seems to be much the same.\n“She’s focused on setting up a good life, and she is all-in on work,”\none longtime friend told me. “Hope is not someone who needs a lot of\nacquaintances and 10 girlfriends. She values quality over quantity, and\nshe invests in people who she is really close with.” She still texts\nwith Ivanka and Gidley and sees Raffel when he visits Los Angeles. The\npresident still calls her, too.</p>\n<p>There are many questions about what will happen to New Fox, which is\ncompeting in a universe against far larger media behemoths as consumers\ncontinue to cut the cord and pivot to streaming services. Fox News still\nthrows off more than a billion in profit, but its audience is well\nbeyond retirement age, and the company’s other core properties (its\nsports networks and Fox Business) may not provide a bulletproof hedge\nagainst the digital future. Media observers wonder whether Rupert\nMurdoch, who has traditionally led with his gut, has erred in entrusting\nso much responsibility to a 30-year-old with no experience at a public\ncompany and major Trump baggage&#8212;not to mention whatever potential\nlegal entanglements she might face down the line. Meanwhile, Hicks has\ndone little to offer clues to political junkies. Was she a\nco-conspirator in Trumpworld, or someone just along for the ride? A\ncunning political operator, or an indifferent player with highly attuned\nGreenwich-style social skills? Younger than the vast majority of her\nformer colleagues, will she forever be remembered for something she did\nin her 20s? The Murdochs, for their part, have told people they’re\nimpressed with her work so far, according to those who have spoken with\nthem about Hicks.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the greatest indication that Hicks is, in fact, highly skilled\nat this kind of work is the way in which she has managed her own P.R. In\na campaign and White House where nearly every person became the story at\nsome point, Hicks was able to largely stay out of sight. She’d be lucky\nto maintain this quality in her new life, as she starts the rest of it\nfresh. Indeed, where better to test that out than in L.A.&#8212;a city based\non re-invention? “This is where people come to re-write themselves,”\nthe Hollywood executive told me. “If, at the end of the year, if she\nlasts that long, and she’s at a party, I can’t see people not\ngravitating towards her. She has a big job. People don’t stay in\nHollywood jail forever, not if you’re that pretty.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The family drama surrounding <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/biden-2020-front-runner-family-divorce-drama?inline\">Joe Biden’s presidential bid</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; What to make of the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/buzzfeed-mueller-saga-veteran-journalists-circumspect-confused?inline\">BuzzFeed-Mueller mystery</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; A happy ending for one <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/fyre-festival-caterer-gofundme-maryann-rolle?inline\">Fyre Festival contractor</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Intrigue in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jesse-angelo-abruptly-exits-the-new-york-post-murdoch?inline\">Murdoch-land</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Yes, <em>Schitt’s Creek</em> really is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/yes-schitts-creek-really-is-that-good?inline\">that good</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"From The Magazine","socialTitle":"Hope Hicks, West Wing Alum, Begins Her Second Act on the West Coast","socialDescription":"After years in the Trump orbit, Hicks has entered a brave new world of Murdochs, fussy trade reporters, and Los Angeles semiotics.

Bossie? Berman? <em>Reince Priebus!?!</em>","body":"<p>On Friday night, members of <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> West Wing gathered for drinks at the Trump International Hotel following a holiday dinner at the White House. As they mingled in the lobby, <strong>Bill Shine, Stephen Miller, Kellyanne Conway, Sarah Huckabee Sanders,</strong> and others grappled with the latest West Wing upheaval: Trump had changed the plan and fired Chief of Staff <strong>John Kelly</strong> earlier that afternoon. “It got back to Trump that Kelly was bad-mouthing him and Trump had decided he’d had enough. His attitude was, ‘fuck him,’” an attendee told me.</p>\n<p>Kelly’s defenestration surprised few people&#8212;Trump had wanted to fire him for months&#8212;but the lingering problem had been finding a replacement whom Trump felt comfortable with (and who wanted the job). “The president really wanted someone he knows. He didn’t want to gamble,” a former West Wing official said. After weeks of lobbying by <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> and <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> Trump had been convinced that <strong>Mike Pence’s</strong> 36-year-old chief of staff, <strong>Nick Ayers,</strong> was the best candidate. On Friday afternoon, Trump met with Ayers, Pence, and Kelly and finalized the transition, a source briefed on the meeting said. A press release announcing Ayers’s hiring was reportedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/09/us/politics/nick-ayers-trump-chief-of-staff.html\">drafted</a> and ready to go for when Trump planned to announce Kelly’s departure on Monday.</p>\n<p>But Trump’s frustration with Kelly boiled over after Kelly pressed him to name his deputy <strong>Zachary Fuentes</strong> interim chief of staff. “Trump didn’t like how Kelly was trying to dictate the terms of his departure,” a Republican briefed on the discussions told me. Trump blew up the carefully orchestrated announcement and told reporters on Saturday as he walked to Marine One that Kelly would be leaving by the end of the year. “John wanted to announce his own departure. This was a humiliation,” a former West Wing official said.</p>\n<p>Trump’s impulsive announcement quickly became an even bigger problem when it turned out that Kelly’s replacement was not sewn up; Ayers surprised Trump later that day by insisting that he only wanted the job short term. “Trump was pissed, he was caught off guard,” a former West Wing official briefed on the talks said. Sources said Ayers, who has triplets, told Trump he wanted to return to Georgia with his wife in the spring and work on a super PAC supporting Trump’s 2020 re-election. But a former White House official said Ayers wanted to avoid intense scrutiny on his financial dealings (last year, Ayers <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4113639-Ayers-SF278-101917.html\">reported</a> a net worth of $12.2 million to $54.8 million from his political-consulting ventures). “He started getting calls from reporters with requests for information about how he made his money and he thought, ‘Do I really want to do this?’” said a source familiar with his thinking.</p>\n<p>Losing Ayers put Trump back in the position of searching for a chief of staff at a time when the White House will be under siege from <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> and House Democrats. Over the weekend, Blackstone Chairman and C.E.O. <strong>Stephen Schwarzman</strong> called Trump and recommended Blackstone senior managing director <strong>Wayne Berman</strong> for the role, a source said. (A spokesperson for Blackstone denied this.) But sources said Trump doesn’t have any obvious choices. Allies of <strong>Steve Bannon</strong> are pushing House Freedom Caucus Chair <strong>Mark Meadows</strong> and Citizens United president <strong>Dave Bossie.</strong> Other names that have surfaced include Treasury Secretary <strong>Steve Mnuchin</strong> and Office of Management and Budget Head <strong>Mick Mulvaney.</strong> A senior White House official told me, in a sign of the depth of the current difficulties, that even former chief of staff <strong>Reince Priebus</strong> has been brought up as a possible replacement for Kelly.</p>\n<p>A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The Democrats are facing a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/democrats-face-a-generational-reckoning?inline\">generational reckoning</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; How a movie producer and Hollywood invented <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/how-hollywood-invented-ben-shapiro?inline\">conservative commentator Ben Shapiro</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Real estate, greed, extortion: a true <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/12/jills-miami-real-estate-extortion?inline\">tale of <em>Miami Vice</em></a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Sandra Bland’s sisters are still searching for <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/say-her-name-sandra-bland-documentary-interview\">answers about her death</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; It sure looks like Saudi Arabia <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/trump-hotel-saudi-arabia?inline\">used veterans to funnel money to Trump</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"John Kelly","socialTitle":"“This Was a Humiliation”: After Firing Kelly, Trump Has No Plan B","socialDescription":"Hyper-ambitious wunderkind Nick Ayers led Trump on, then left him in the lurch.

Months later, after he had clinched the nomination, he still didn’t get that the people he’d begrudgingly allowed <strong>Chris Christie</strong> to hire for the job had to be paid, and tried to shutter the whole operation because he thought transition workers were “stealing” his money. In November, after he had won the election, President-Elect Slow-on-the-Uptake fired everyone who’d been manning the transition team, threw their work in the trash, and decided, per <strong>Michael Lewis,</strong> that he was going to handle things “more or less by himself,” a bone-chilling determination that he made right around the time it came out that he <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/leading-contender-for-donald-trump-s-chief-of-staff-is-rnc-chairman-reince-priebus-1479069597\">thought <strong>Barack Obama’s</strong> West Wing staff came with the White House</a>. In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/27/this-guy-doesnt-know-anything-the-inside-story-of-trumps-shambolic-transition-team\">words</a> of his own campaign chairman-turned-senior adviser, Trump didn’t “know anything,” and worse, he didn’t “give a shit.” And apparently, not much has changed since then, only now, he’s like, y‘know, the actual president.</p>\n<p><em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/millions-face-delayed-tax-refunds-cuts-to-food-aid-as-white-house-scrambles-to-deal-with-shutdown/2019/01/04/b5b58616-0fa3-11e9-8938-5898adc28fa2_story.html\">reports</a> that, two weeks <em>after</em> Trump shut down the government over his ridiculous border wall, the administration&#8212;only then!&#8212;“recognized . . . the breadth of the potential impact” of the president’s actions. In other words, the people in charge of the most powerful nation in the world evidently had no idea that the government actually does stuff, and that when it runs out of money, that stuff ceases to function:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Food stamps for 38 million low-income Americans would face severe reductions and more than $140 billion in tax refunds are at risk of being frozen or delayed if the government shutdown stretches into February, widespread disruptions that threaten to hurt the economy. . . . The partial shutdown has cut off new funding to the Treasury Department and the USDA, leaving them largely unstaffed and crippling both departments’ ability to fulfill core functions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The potential cuts to food stamps and suspension of tax refunds illustrate the compounding consequences of leaving large parts of the federal govern­ment unfunded indefinitely&#8212;a ­scenario that became more likely Friday when President Trump said he would leave the government shut down for months or even years unless Democrats gave him money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That Trump, whose mental impairment is made obvious <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-approval-rating-europe-polls-white-house-oval-office-border-wall-a8708746.html\">every time he opens his mouth</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1080088373451206656\">sends out a tweet</a>, wouldn’t understand the impact of a government shutdown is entirely wholly unsurprising. Still, you might think that <em>someone</em> in his administration&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-appointees-giant-raises-during-shutdown\">perhaps the people who just got a sweet raise</a>?&#8212;would have been aware of the consequences ahead of time. But you’d think wrong!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Senior administration officials . . . [told <em>The Washington Post</em>] they were focused now on understanding the scope of the consequences and determining whether there is anything they can do to intervene.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Late Monday, the White House <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-07/irs-will-pay-refunds-during-government-shutdown-official-says\">said</a> it had figured out a way for the Internal Revenue Service to issue refunds even if the shutdown extends into the filing season. That’s good for taxpayers, but unfortunately, it actually takes some of the pressure off of Trump to strike a deal, <em>increasing</em> the likelihood that President Man-Child will dig in until he gets funding for his precious wall. Of course, without a deal, thousands of other government functions remain beholden to the whims of a guy who doesn’t know his ass from his elbow. And, as he’s made abundantly clear, he <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/trump-shutdown-mostly-democrats\">couldn’t care less</a> if federal employees&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/government-tells-furloughed-workers-to-unclog-toilets-for-rent\">currently being advised to unclog toilets for rent</a>&#8212;go unpaid, a point of view that presumably extends to whether or not 38 million Americans lose their food stamps, or thousands of people get evicted because, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/as-shutdown-drags-on-trump-officials-seek-novel-ways-to-cope-with-its-impacts/2019/01/06/96c54a50-11ee-11e9-90a8-136fa44b80ba_story.html\">oops</a>, a Department of Housing and Urban Development program expired on January 1.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the president totally has a plan to end the suffering:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1082347305699889157\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1082347305699889157\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1082347305699889157</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Just what the shutdown doctor ordered: 60 minutes of incoherent rambling about steel slats, rapists, invented-on-the-fly caravans, and an internal debate over whether or not the wall is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-claims-the-wall-he-shut-down-the-government-to-fund-is-already-built\">“desperately needed” or already built and paid for</a>.

The I.R.S. is still working on contingencies if the shutdown continues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The processing of returns and customer service&#8212;most of those employees have been furloughed,” said <strong>Nicole Kaeding,</strong> director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation. “How will they bring those employees back, and will they be compensated while they’re working?” she asked. “Those are some large questions that haven’t been answered, even though they said refunds would be processed.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To be fair, the administration only realized a couple days ago that a government shutdown resulted in a shutdown of the government, so it probably needs some time to hammer things out.</p>\n<p><strong>Capitalism is working out pretty well for Ray Dalio</strong></p>\n<p>The hedge-fund manager, who <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/billionaire-ray-dialo-says-capitalism-is-not-working-for-most-people-1541780451\">said</a> in November that “capitalism is basically not working for the majority of people” and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/415940-billionaire-investor-capitalism-is-not-working-for-most-people\">characterized</a> the wealth and opportunity gap as “a national emergency,” saw his flagship fund <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-06/bridgewater-s-pure-alpha-fund-is-said-to-return-14-6-last-year\">rise</a> 14.6 percent in 2018, the worst year for the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones since 2008.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ll never believe it, but state-run Fox News misled its viewers about A.O.C.’s comments on tax rates</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1082263701590286336\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1082263701590286336\">https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1082263701590286336</a></p></blockquote></div><p>To be fair, so did House Minority Whip <strong>Steve Scalise:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveScalise/status/1081579535114608640\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveScalise/status/1081579535114608640\">https://twitter.com/SteveScalise/status/1081579535114608640</a></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>Hedge Funds That Returned 20 Percent Show All Is Not Lost (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-04/hedge-funds-returning-20-show-all-is-not-lost-for-smart-money\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>Wall Street Firms Plan New Exchange to Challenge N.Y.S.E., Nasdaq (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-firms-plan-new-exchange-to-challenge-nyse-nasdaq-11546866121\"><em>W.S.J.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Warren bashes banks and billionaires in first 2020 campaign swing (<a href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/articles/warren-bashes-banks-and-billionaires-in-first-2020-campaign-swing\"><em>American Banker</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Therapist sues <em>Billions,</em> alleging Dr. Wendy Rhoades is based on her (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-07/therapist-sees-herself-on-tv-s-billions-except-for-one-thing\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>The French Burglar Who Pulled Off His Generation’s Biggest Art Heist (<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/14/the-french-burglar-who-pulled-off-his-generations-biggest-art-heist\"><em>New Yorker</em></a>)</p>\n<p>How Estimates of the Gig Economy Went Wrong (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-estimates-of-the-gig-economy-went-wrong-11546857000\"><em>W.S.J.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>World Bank President Resigns to Join Investment Firm (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/world-bank-president-jim-yong-kim-to-resign-in-february-11546879066\"><em>W.S.J.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>“The first thing I could grab was a nappy . . . so I was on the floor saying ‘why won&#39;t you die,’ and screaming and my daughter was screaming in the playroom,” Howard told 9News, of his attempts to kill a spider.

Both lived on the same block on the Upper East Side. More notably, both were crucial supporting players in the Trump orbit. Cohen had been an indefatigable booster of <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> helping to arrange his real-estate deals, paying off alleged mistresses, and quashing would-be damaging stories regarding his boss. Wolkoff, for a time, was a lesser-known, but equally diligent enforcer for <strong>Melania Trump.</strong></p>\n<p>The two women had met years earlier, when Wolkoff helped produce the Metropolitan Museum’s Costume Institute Benefit. (<strong>Anna Wintour,</strong> who hosts the gala, is editor-in-chief of <em>Vogue</em> and the artistic director of Condé Nast, <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s parent company.) Over the years, Wolkoff would become a member of Melania’s small inner circle. After Trump’s surprise electoral-college victory, she went on to help the First Lady in Washington, serving as a senior adviser to her official governmental office on matters large and small. Wolkoff helped facilitate Melania’s transition to the White House, and advised her on policy platforms, East Wing décor, and her overall messaging.</p>\n<p>The two were close enough that Wolkoff could openly express divergent views. According to sources familiar with the conversations, Wolkoff told Melania and East Wing staffers that the name for her anti-bullying initiative, “Be Best,” sounded illiterate. (The First Lady, according to these sources, feared that an alternative, “Children First,” was too similar to her husband’s “America First” branding.) They also disagreed about the infamous “I Really Don’t Care, Do U?” jacket that the First Lady wore to the U.S.-Mexico border. (Melania, according to these sources, thought the trip would not get attention without such a brazen fashion gesture. In an interview with ABC News in October, she said that she wore the jacket for the media and people who were criticizing her, and wondered aloud whether the trip would have received similar attention without it.) But the two women remained close, nevertheless. On trips to D.C., Wolkoff would sometimes spend the night in the White House residence; other times, she would book a room in the Trump International Hotel down Pennsylvania Avenue. According to e-mail exchanges from the time, she was given the friends and family rate of $345 a night, and told to submit receipts to <strong>Reince Priebus.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/c97a4730-bc95-4032-b21a-a970764c038c?customColor=%23ff0000\"><iframe height=\"220\" width=\"750\" src=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/c97a4730-bc95-4032-b21a-a970764c038c?customColor=%23ff0000\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong><em>iTunes user?

Cohen, of course, went from being one of the president’s closest confidants to one of his most bitter and dangerous adversaries. Wolkoff’s separation was less public, but is increasingly newsworthy. Through her company, WIS Media Partners, Wolkoff oversaw Trump’s sprawling week-long inaugural festivities&#8212;she sourced and managed third-party vendors, entertainers, and broadcasters, and oversaw the themes and production of all the concerts, dinners, balls, and programming. She worked in close proximity to the Trump family and inaugural chair <strong>Tom Barrack,</strong> a billionaire private-equity real-estate investor who had been a close friend of the president for years. And yet a year after the swearing-in ceremony, Wolkoff left the White House amid an uncomfortable public-relations crisis regarding the president’s inaugural committee.</p>\n<p>Last February, <em>The New York Times</em> published an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/politics/trumps-inaugural-committee-paid-26-million-to-first-ladys-friend.html\">article</a> centered on WIS, headlined “Trump’s Inaugural Committee Paid $26 million to Firm of First Lady’s Adviser.” The inaugural committee had raised a stunning $107 million&#8212;about twice what <strong>Barack Obama</strong> had hauled in 2009&#8212;from donors such as <strong>Sheldon Adelson</strong> and corporations like AT&amp;T. But as the <em>Times</em> reported, the tax form revealed profligate spending&#8212;nearly $10 million on travel; $4.6 million on salaries and benefits; and $100,000 to <strong>Rick Gates,</strong> the former campaign aide and deputy chairman of the inauguration who, about a week later, became one of <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> first major cooperating witnesses. Some $40 million was publicly unaccounted for. Wolkoff, as the event planner in charge, became the face of the disarray. The <em>Times</em> story quoted an official from a government watchdog group accusing the inaugural committee of “fiscal mismanagement at its worst.”</p>\n<p>Privately, Wolkoff refuted the characterization. According to bank statements, checks, and internal documents that I’ve reviewed, the $26 million in payment to WIS was largely distributed to third-party vendors and labor. Nearly $24 million was paid for projects related to the work of a subcontractor, Inaugural Productions, an independent organization run by individuals formerly associated with television producer <strong>Mark Burnett,</strong> which was responsible for staging several events. Around $1.6 million was used to compensate 15 contract workers who worked with Wolkoff as staffers. Wolkoff herself received $500,000 for her work on the inauguration. She had submitted audited records to the inauguration committee in March 2017, a month after she signed a gratuitous-services contract to work as an unpaid strategist and senior adviser to the First Lady.</p>\n<div class=\"embed image row\"><figure class=\"embedded-image\" data-type=\"image\"><div class=\"pinterest-link-container\"><img src=\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5c5ca4a9d950fb48c24e1c32/master/h_606,c_limit/Stephanie-Winton-Wolkoff-Melania-Trump-embed-01-a.jpg\" alt=\"Stephanie Winston Wolkoff\" title=\"\" data-pin-desc=\"Stephanie Winston Wolkoff attends Strut: The Fashionable Mom Show during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in 2014.\n\" data-pin-credits=\"\"/><a class=\"pinterest-link\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fnews%2F2019%2F02%2Fbehind-the-scenes-of-trumps-107-million-inauguration&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.vanityfair.com%2Fphotos%2F5c5ca4a9d950fb48c24e1c32%2Fmaster%2Fh_606%2Cc_limit%2FStephanie-Winton-Wolkoff-Melania-Trump-embed-01-a.jpg&amp;description=Stephanie%20Winston%20Wolkoff%20attends%20Strut%3A%20The%20Fashionable%20Mom%20Show%20during%20Mercedes-Benz%20Fashion%20Week%20in%202014.%0A\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div><figcaption class=\"caption callout-image-caption\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><span class=\"caption\"><p>Stephanie Winston Wolkoff attends Strut: The Fashionable Mom Show during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in 2014.</p>\n</span><div class=\"credits\">By Chelsea Lauren/Getty Images.</div></div></figcaption></figure></div><p>After the <em>Times</em> article, given her established documentation, Wolkoff urged Melania to defend her. But the administration demurred. <strong>Stephanie Grisham,</strong> the First Lady’s spokesperson, wrote in an e-mail, “This messaging is the best way to go in order to minimize the negative press stories of today and protect FLOTUS &amp; this administration.” A week later, Wolkoff left the East Wing after the White House instilled new security protocols in the wake of the <strong>Rob Porter</strong> scandal. A member of the White House Counsel’s Office called her on February 20, 2018, to let her know that the White House would be terminating all gratuitous-services agreements, including hers. It had nothing to do with her work on the inauguration, this person told her. “I am sorry that the professional part of our relationship has come to an end, but I am comforted in the fact that our [friendship] far outweigh[s] politics,” Melania wrote her in an e-mail later that day. “Thank you Again! Much love.”</p>\n<p>Later that evening, in a phone call, Wolkoff told the First Lady that she worried it appeared as if she had been fired on account of her work on the inauguration. The First Lady urged her not to be “dramatic.” Less than a week later, however, the <em>Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/melania-trump-inauguration-adviser.html\">published a story</a> stating that the severance of Wolkoff’s contract had been “prompted by displeasure from the Trumps” over the $26 million payment. Grisham told the <em>Times</em> that Melania “had no involvement” with the inaugural committee, and “had no knowledge of how funds were spent.” The president would create similar distance. <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> would later say, “The president was focused on the transition during that time, and not on any of the planning for the inauguration.” (A spokeswoman for the First Lady declined to comment for this story, as did the White House.)</p>\n<p>By the time Cohen and Wolkoff spoke last summer, she had returned to her life in New York. He would soon plead guilty to eight counts in a federal courthouse downtown. But Cohen let Wolkoff know that, among other documents and recordings, the F.B.I. had seized hours of their own conversations that he had taped. According to people familiar with the recordings, some of the taped conversations dealt directly with the inauguration. In them, Wolkoff detailed her own contemporaneous concerns with the inauguration&#8212;about how money was being spent, the general chaos of the process, and the involvement of Trump’s adult children. During these conversations, Wolkoff also raised her issues with the two men in charge of the committee: Gates and Barrack.</p>\n<p>These recordings, in part, led the Southern District of New York to launch a criminal investigation into how the inaugural committee spent its record $107 million. Now, the investigation appears to be advancing. In December, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-inauguration-spending-under-criminal-investigation-by-federal-prosecutors-11544736455\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/trump-inauguration-investigation.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported that prosecutors are examining the committee’s spending, and investigating whether foreign donors from nations including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates funneled money to the committee in an effort to influence U.S. policy. On Monday, the inaugural committee received a subpoena from the S.D.N.Y. requesting documents related to spending and donors, vendors, and benefits handed out, as well as documents related to a wealthy donor who had once registered as a foreign agent working on behalf of the Sri Lankan government. The <em>Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-inauguration-spending-under-criminal-investigation-by-federal-prosecutors-11544736455\">reported</a> that prosecutors have asked Gates about the inaugural fund’s spending and its donors. (<strong>Lorin Reisner</strong>, an attorney for Wolkoff, said in a statement: “Stephanie is not going to comment on these reports. She remains proud of her work on the inauguration, and we are confident that her conduct was proper in all respects.” Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>The subpoena is the latest sign that, while the Mueller investigation could be winding down, the Southern District may be probing a variety of Trump-adjacent avenues into the foreseeable future. An inquiry into the inauguration might also be acutely poignant, given Trump’s concurrent association with both his business and his incoming administration in its earliest days. It involved big money and outside influence. And it involved the Trump family in intimate, important ways. Wolkoff, suddenly and unexpectedly, could find herself in the middle of the maelstrom.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Wolkoff had made a career in the events business, but she knew from the outset the inauguration would be a unique, and uniquely Trumpian, experience. First, she was a political novice who knew little about what an inauguration entailed. Then, there was Trump’s controversial reputation. Upon accepting the post on the Friday after his election, Wolkoff quickly reached out to her network of vendors. Most of them, according to people familiar with these conversations, resisted the opportunity to work with Trump. Even Burnett, who Trump enlisted to conjure up reality-show-like gimmicks (such as flying a gaggle of drones over the crowd), wanted to keep his involvement private. (Burnett did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>Moreover, and perhaps not surprisingly, Trump’s family wanted to be involved in certain aspects of the coordination. Part of this, of course, was because they were going to be included in many of the events and, logistically, they had to know where to be and what to wear. It was also because Trump’s adult children have always been involved in affairs pertaining to their father, from his businesses to <em>The Apprentice</em> to his campaign. Each week, Wolkoff met with senior inaugural-committee members to present itemized, detailed updates on the status of her planning and financial reports from each vendor and for each event. She was also making regular presentations to Trump, Melania, and the Trump family about various decisions, so that they could weigh in. (White House spokespeople have previously denied that the Trumps were involved in any planning, and said they knew little about the events.) Trump and <strong>Ivanka</strong> were briefed on Burnett’s drone idea, for instance, after they had met with singer <strong>Andrea Bocelli</strong> in his office in Trump Tower about the possibility of him singing at an event. (The Italian tenor did not end up performing.)</p>\n<p>Trump was focused on the big-picture theatrics. He wanted to arrive on the Mall in a military plane with a military escort, much as he had arrived for tapings of <em>The Apprentice</em> on Trump Organization helicopters. He also wanted to have a full military parade, as well as tanks and helicopters on the ground. Ivanka, meanwhile, had more particular interests, according to e-mail and text exchanges and people familiar with the conversations. Originally, Ivanka wanted to host an event for women on the Wednesday before her father’s swearing-in ceremony. (The plan was ultimately scrapped.) To be helpful, she suggested a photographer who had once shot her for <em>Town &amp; Country</em> as someone who could take the official family portrait. She also offered a D.J. friend of hers from New York as a possible performer. She texted photos of the Obama family standing onstage together, with <strong>Sasha</strong> and <strong>Malia</strong> prominently situated in the middle of the frame. “FYI regarding the swearing in, it is nice to have family with him for this special moment,” she wrote.</p>\n<div class=\"embed image row\"><figure class=\"embedded-image\" data-type=\"image\"><div class=\"pinterest-link-container\"><img src=\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5c5ca4a99e70dd2f91afe3b5/master/w_690,c_limit/Stephanie-Winton-Wolkoff-Melania-Trump-embed-02.jpg\" alt=\"Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushne\" title=\"\" data-pin-desc=\"Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner dance at the Inaugural Ball.\n\" data-pin-credits=\"\"/><a class=\"pinterest-link\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fnews%2F2019%2F02%2Fbehind-the-scenes-of-trumps-107-million-inauguration&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.vanityfair.com%2Fphotos%2F5c5ca4a99e70dd2f91afe3b5%2Fmaster%2Fw_690%2Cc_limit%2FStephanie-Winton-Wolkoff-Melania-Trump-embed-02.jpg&amp;description=Ivanka%20Trump%20and%20Jared%20Kushner%20dance%20at%20the%20Inaugural%20Ball.%0A\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div><figcaption class=\"caption callout-image-caption\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><span class=\"caption\"><p>Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner dance at the Inaugural Ball.</p>\n</span><div class=\"credits\">By Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images.</div></div></figcaption></figure></div><p>In large part, Wolkoff worried about potential ethical issues surrounding the First Family-elect and their businesses. After all, Gates had been staying in a suite at the Trump Hotel for most of the inaugural planning. More than a dozen inaugural staffers had also been staying there. The <em>Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/trump-inauguration-spending.html\">reported</a> last month that WIS alone had charged $31,000 for hotel rooms in the span of less than two months, including almost $18,000 at the Trump International Hotel. That did not include what was charged for room service, meals, and travel. In all, the Trump International Hotel was paid more than $1.5 million in inaugural funds, according to the <em>Times.</em> (Wolkoff’s contract states that the inaugural committee would reimburse WIS for travel, long-distance phone calls, mail-delivery services, and expenses connected to the performance of its work. WIS stands for “Who Is She,” Wolkoff’s play on her own anonymity.)</p>\n<p>During the course of planning, Wolkoff had corresponded with Ivanka about the cost of using the Trump Hotel for events leading up to the swearing-in ceremony. On December 10, 2016, a Trump Organization employee sent an estimate for a ballroom rental and food and beverage minimum to use the Trump Hotel space for eight days. The price she quoted was $3.6 million, according to an e-mail. A week later, Gates e-mailed Ivanka about the cost. In this exchange, first <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-trumps-inauguration-paid-trumps-company-with-ivanka-in-the-middle\">published</a> this past December by ProPublica and WNYC, Wolkoff flagged her concern. “These events are in PE’s [the president-elect’s] honor at his hotel and one of them is for family and close friends. Please take into consideration that when this is audited it will become public knowledge,” she wrote. (<strong>Peter Mirijanian,</strong> a spokesperson for Ivanka’s counsel <strong>Abbe Lowell,</strong> said in a statement: “When contacted by someone working on the inauguration, Ms. Trump passed the inquiry on to a hotel official and said only that any resulting discussions should be at a ‘fair market rate.’ Ms. Trump was not involved in any additional discussions.”)</p>\n<p>For an event producer used to detailed lists and punctilious itemization, Wolkoff was often caught off guard by the ad-hoc nature of the committee. According to the two people familiar with the matter, Gates approached a couple individuals working on the inauguration and asked if they would be willing to be paid directly for their work by a donor, rather than by the inaugural committee. They had received more donations than they’d initially anticipated, Gates told these people. Skirting the usual payment route could allow the inaugural committee to avoid reporting the full amount raised from donors. (A lawyer for Gates did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>Wolkoff frequently told Melania about her concerns regarding Gates, these people said. She relayed her concern about the high access level of his security pass within Trump Tower and his closeness with the Trump family. In her view, these people said, he exacerbated a situation already fraught with potential conflicts of interest. Members of the inaugural committee talked about how he frequently worked out of <strong>Donald Trump Jr.’s</strong> office. He was in constant communication with the adult children in order to keep them in the loop about decisions surrounding the inauguration.</p>\n<p>Wolkoff also questioned Gates and Barrack about pricing and budgets across the board, according to the people familiar with the conversations. She started to grow concerned about being left out of meetings, particularly as she raised more red flags. Because part of her responsibilities included reviewing all budgets from her vendors and presenting them to other members of the inaugural committee, she studied the line items in order to be able to explain them. At points, she could not justify the numbers coming in. After circulation of a quote from one of their largest event-production vendors, Hargrove LLC, Wolkoff was shocked that no one in the organization appeared willing to question the figures. She suggested that the quote seemed far beyond what the Obama inaugural committee would have been charged in 2009. She sent an e-mail to her team and Barrack on December 31, 2016. “I am DISGUSTED by [Hargrove’s] lack of transparency and entitlement to [the Presidential Inaugural Committee’s] funding,” she wrote. “I can not approve any budget line items because I do not have a clue what these numbers represent!!” (Hargrove did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>One of the most concerning aspects to Wolkoff’s team, according to the people familiar with the situation, was the amount of money and attention being spent on Barrack’s chairman dinner, which he hosted on an evening before the swearing-in. A draft guest list for the event from days before the dinner included the likes of retired Lieutenant General <strong>Mike Flynn,</strong> G.O.P. fund-raiser <strong>Elliott Broidy,</strong> Michael Cohen, and key officials in the incoming administration. Among the list marked as confirmed were seven people described as “foreign ministers” for Saudi Arabia, one foreign minister from Qatar, and one from the United Arab Emirates. They were the only people on the list who were unnamed. (On Tuesday, ProPublica <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-tom-barrack-colony-company-of-trump-inaugural-chair-sought-to-profit\">published</a> a memo that showed Barrack’s investment firm planned to profit from its connections to the Trump administration. A spokesperson called it “an outline of a proposed potential business plan which was never acted upon or implemented.”)</p>\n<p>A spokesman for Barrack declined to comment, but pointed me toward comments Barrack made in a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chairmans-global-dinner-most-exclusive-event-preceding-trump-inauguration-1484571781\"><em>Journal</em> report</a> published days before the inauguration. “The evening is intended to be the president-elect’s first fingerprint on the global canvas of social democracy and outreach,” Barrack said at the time, explaining that the evening was set up to reach out to local international diplomats and create a “hopeful tapestry of international cooperation and respect.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Much has been made of the various problems with the inauguration, from the lackluster crowd size to the president’s own “American carnage” speech, which struck a tone so dark that <strong>George W. Bush</strong> was reportedly heard calling it “some weird shit.” But Wolkoff’s part, the event itself, went off without a hitch, and the family was pleased. The day after the swearing-in ceremony was Wolkoff’s birthday. The Trumps sent flowers to the Trump Hotel room where she had been staying. She flew back to New York on a military plane with Melania, her stylist, hairdresser, makeup artist, and the rest of the Trump family, apart from the president, Ivanka, and <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> who remained in Washington.</p>\n<p>Much is still unknown about how inaugural funds were managed, or if the unaccounted for $40-odd million will ever be publicly explained. It’s unclear whether there was foreign influence, or illicit attempts to profit off of proceedings. What Gates has offered investigators&#8212;about anything, really, but about the inauguration, in particular&#8212;is also unclear. How deep the Southern District’s investigation into all of this is yet unknown. But much like some of Cohen’s other taped conversations, the discussions with Wolkoff about the inauguration may have turned out to be consequential. On the witness stand during <strong>Paul Manafort’s</strong> trial in Virginia last summer, prosecutors asked Gates if he charged personal expenses to the committee. “It’s possible,” he responded.</p>\n<p>As investigators continue to pursue the matter, they may find themselves in a familiar situation: seeking out former Trump allies-turned-adversaries who saw it all go down firsthand. One of the most inexplicable plot points in the whirling Trump drama has been the president’s public treatment of his former lawyer. Trump was aware that Cohen possessed all manner of damaging information about him, and yet he wasted few opportunities to disparage him publicly. Ultimately, Cohen implicated Trump in federal campaign-finance violations as he pleaded guilty. He spent more than 70 hours cooperating with federal investigators, opening his book to tell them what he knew about the president, his business, and the campaign. While Wolkoff’s treatment has been gentler, she’s been similarly isolated and publicly disparaged. And now, what she knows could be of interest to investigators, too.</p>\n<p><em>This story has been updated to reflect Mark Burnett&#39;s connection to Inaugural Productions.</em></p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Trump’s World","socialTitle":"“I Am Disgusted”: Behind the Scenes of Trump’s $107 Million Inauguration","socialDescription":"Stephanie Winston Wolkoff was the mastermind event producer behind Trump’s inaugural celebration, which has since come under S.D.N.Y. investigation.

recalls the leaking, the gossiping, and the infighting that made Kellyanne Conway such a formidable player in the White House.","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>The inner circle of Trumpworld was not always a pretty picture. Too often, it was a portrait of venality, stubbornness, and selfishness. We leaked. We schemed. We backstabbed. Some of us told ourselves it was all done in the service of a higher calling&#8212;to protect the president, to deliver for the people. But usually it was for ourselves. Most of us came to Washington convinced of the justice of our cause and the righteousness of our principles, certain that our moral compasses were true. But proximity to power changes that. <strong>Donald Trump</strong> changes that. The once-clear lines&#8212;between right and wrong, good and evil, light and darkness&#8212;were eroded, until only a faint wrinkle remained.</p>\n<p>A particular case in point involves <strong>Kellyanne Conway,</strong> who had the title of Trump’s 2016 campaign manager. (Though it was really <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> if anyone, who was actually in charge.) As counselor to the president, Kellyanne managed to land a job with no fixed responsibilities. “What exactly does Kellyanne do?” was a question people asked all the time. So she was able to continue being the president’s pit bull on TV&#8212;a job that never goes out of fashion in Trumpworld&#8212;and otherwise just dabble in areas that piqued her interest. She would later focus her efforts on the opioid crisis and veterans’ issues, but early on she was content&#8212;very content&#8212;to sit back, go on TV, and let rivals eat one another alive. And she was predictably resentful of both <strong>Ivanka</strong> and Jar­ed’s immovable status in Trump’s orbit.</p>\n<p>As I watched Kellyanne in operation over our time in the White House, my view of her sharpened. It became hard to look long at her without getting the sense that she was a cartoon villain brought to life. Her agenda&#8212;which was her survival over all others, including the president&#8212;became more and more transparent. Once you figured that out, everything about her seemed so calculated; every statement, even a seemingly innocuous one, seemed poll-tested by a focus group that existed inside her mind. She seemed to be peren­nially cloaked in an invisible fur coat, casting an all-­knowing smile, as if she’d collected 98 Dalmatians with only 3 more to go.</p>\n<p>I’m not sure the president ever fully understood that about Kellyanne. But what he clearly shared with her was a love of media attention. Unlike most human beings, Trump’s greatest fear wasn’t death or failure or loss. It was obscurity. If he was noticed, he mattered. And he didn’t care much if the attention was good or bad, as long as it wasn’t indifferent. Mentions in the press had long been his oxygen. Another Page Six scoop, another breath. A <em>Time</em> magazine cover, a shot of adrenaline. He spent his adult life keeping the brand going, whatever it took. He couldn’t just own a nice hotel, but the most beautiful hotel ever built. He couldn’t just have a difficult divorce, but the most sensational ever to hit the tabloids. He couldn’t just have a popular TV show; it had to be the most highly rated in history. He couldn’t be a good president; he’d have to be as great&#8212;greater, even&#8212;than Lincoln.</p>\n<p>Trump sincerely held most members of the media in low regard&#8212;that wasn’t just for show. But what he didn’t like to admit was that he also craved their ap­proval. And nothing was more a focus of his attention in this regard than <em>The New York Times.</em> It was his hometown paper, after all. During a dinner with evan­gelical leaders in the Blue Room, Trump named the exact number of occa­sions he had been on the front page of the <em>Times</em> during his career as a businessman. It was only a handful. “Now, I’m on there almost every day,” he observed, though usually not in the way he would have liked. He added, with a mix of pride and irritation, that Ivanka, who was also in the room, still got better coverage in the <em>Times</em> than he did.</p>\n<p>Like many presidents, he was obsessed with White House staffers who leaked against him&#8212;and was always on a quest to figure out a way to unmask them. On one memorable occasion, the president got a prominent White House reporter on the phone who had written a story that quoted anonymous staff members. “Who gave you this story?” Trump asked playfully. “I’d just be curious to know who told you this.”</p>\n<p>The reporter laughed somewhat nervously, saying they obviously could not reveal their sources. Leaning over the phone in the Oval Office, arms crossed in front of him with his elbows sitting on the Resolute Desk, Trump tried to cut a deal. “Well, I guess that’s fine,” he replied. “But, of course, you know I could give you so much better stories&#8212;so much better.” After a little more unsuccessful coaxing, Trump relented. The reporter hung up without a hot scoop from “a source close to the president.”</p>\n<p>His somewhat-playful attempted bribe was unsuccessful that day, but Trump never halted his effort to uncover the leakers in his midst. It was also a favorite parlor game among staff in the West Wing to guess who the unnamed White House officials were in various stories. But one day, by sheer accident, I didn’t have to guess anymore.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>In May 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/business/media/kellyanne-conway-joe-mika.html\">hosts of MSNBC’s <em>Morning Joe</em> appeared on-air</a> to accuse Kellyanne of being two­-faced when it came to Donald Trump. <strong>Mika Brzezinski</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/business/media/mika-joe-kellyanne-conway.html?module=inline\">claimed</a> that when Kellyanne came on their show during the campaign, she would lavish Trump with praise, and then “the camera would be turned off, the microphone would be taken off, and she would say, ‘Blech, I need to take a shower,’ because she disliked her candidate so much.” <strong>Joe Scarborough</strong> asserted that Kellyanne had only taken the Trump gig because it would pay off finan­cially. And they both said they had decided to no longer book her on the show because she lacked credibility.</p>\n<p>Kellyanne had developed pretty thick skin, and normally she would let this kind of stuff go. So I was a little surprised when she called me upstairs to her office to discuss issuing a response. I assumed this was because she feared Trump would believe the charges, which might threaten her plum White House position of doing whatever it was she wanted whenever she felt like it.</p>\n<p>Kellyanne’s office was one of the largest in the West Wing. On the top floor, above <strong>Steve Bannon</strong> and Kushner’s offices below, it was about twice as long as it was wide. On the south end of the room, where her desk sat, she had the most valuable commodity in the West Wing: two fairly large, square exter­nal windows. On the opposite end of the room, she had a small conference table that could comfortably seat six. In between, there was a sitting area with a couch and two chairs positioned on opposite sides of an oval coffee table. The office had been set up this same way when <strong>Valerie Jarrett</strong> occupied it during the Obama years. Just outside her door, in a tiny reception area, sat her executive assistant, who handled her calendar, and her body man, who shadowed her every move and catered to her needs.</p>\n<p>I had not brought my work laptop upstairs with me when she called, so Kellyanne pointed over to her personal MacBook sitting on the conference table on the other side of the room. “Just use that and type something up for me,” she said.</p>\n<p>I sat down and started slowly pecking out a statement. While working in the White House, I found that I’d grown so accustomed to writing in Trump’s voice that writing for other people had become somewhat harder than it nor­mally would have been. I was already getting off to a slow start, but I was also getting distracted by the nonstop stream of iMessages popping up on the screen. At that point, personal phones had not yet been banned in the West Wing, so Kellyanne was sitting at her desk texting away. And since her iMes­sage account was tied to both her phone and her laptop, which she must not have even considered, I could inadvertently see every conversation she was having.</p>\n<p>Over the course of 20 minutes or so, she was having simultaneous conversations with no fewer than a half­-dozen reporters, most of them from outlets the White House frequently trashed for publishing “fake news.” Jour­nalists from <em>The New York Times,</em> <em>The Washington Post,</em> CNN, Politico, and Bloomberg were all popping up on the screen. And these weren’t policy conversations, or attempts to fend off attacks on the president. As I sat there trying to type, she bashed Jared Kushner, <strong>Reince Priebus,</strong> Steve Bannon, and <strong>Sean Spicer,</strong> all by name. (“The real leakers, past and present, get much more positive press than I do. While it’s rare, I prefer to knife people from the front, so they see it coming,” Conway said in a statement shortly after publication. According to a source familiar with the situation, the statement was drafted in consultation with her husband, George Conway. Subsequently, George Conway has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1088277015122325504\">denied involvement</a> with the statement on Twitter. A White House aide close to Kellyanne Conway insisted that George Conway was not involved in this statement, but did contribute to the statement submitted to <em>Morning Joe</em>. )</p>\n<p>She also recounted private conversations she’d had with the president, during which, at least in her telling, she’d convinced him to see things her way, which she said was a challenge when you’re deal­ing with someone so unpredictable and unrestrained. She wasn’t totally trashing the president, at least as the <em>Morning Joe</em> crew described it, but she definitely wasn’t painting him in the most favorable light. She was talking about him like a child she had to set straight. I was sitting there, watching this, totally bewildered. I was supposed to be writing a statement, defending her against accusations that she had done almost exactly what I was watch­ing her do that very moment.</p>\n<p>When <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> co-host <strong>Abby Huntsman</strong> later <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/02/kellyanne-conway-number-one-leaker-494436\">asked Kellyanne about allegations</a> that she was the “No. 1 leaker” in the administration, she sidestepped the question, only saying that “leakers get great press,” and adding that “one day, Abby, I will have my say.”</p>\n<p>From what I saw on her computer, she was having her say all day long. Kellyanne was playing a double game&#8212;putting a foot in both worlds&#8212;telling Trump and his supporters on Fox one thing, while bad-­mouthing them to the “main­stream” media in private. It didn’t hurt matters with the latter group that her husband, <strong>George,</strong> was an increasingly frequent critic of the president on Twit­ter. If the Trump administration was the <em>Titanic,</em> as many outsiders routinely claimed, then Kellyanne seemed determined to play the role of the Unsink­able Molly Brown. She wasn’t going to go down with this ship.</p>\n<p>I suspect that posterity will look back on this bizarre time in history as if we were living in the pages of a Dickens novel. <em>It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.</em> Some of us on both sides of that blurry divide were young, wide-eyed, and seeing the real world for the first time. Others were battle-weary, watching with great cynicism the twisting of the American experiment. Those of us who were there were part of a unique moment in time when the greatest nation on earth wrestled with its better angels and its nagging demons. We will hold tight to the triumphs, lose sleep over the failures, and perhaps shed tears over what could have been. Some of us will be proud of what we did. Others will be ashamed and never speak of it again. Some will remember this as the best work we ever did. Others will wish it could all be deleted from the record.</p>\n<p>Lincoln famously had his Team of Rivals. Trump had his Team of Vipers. We served. We fought. We brought our egos. We brought our personal agendas and vendettas. We were ruthless. And some of us, I assume, were good people.</p>\n<p><em>This article is adapted from</em> Team of Vipers <em>by Cliff Sims.

The White House search for John Kelly’s successor takes another soap-operatic turn.","body":"<p>The messy, shambolic search for <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> next chief of staff has become “sad to watch,” as author <strong>Chris Whipple</strong> recently remarked. <strong>John Kelly,</strong> who resigned last weekend without a successor, is eager to end his humiliation as quickly as possible, and has said he will depart by year’s end. The staffer who had been expected to take over, <strong>Nick Ayers,</strong> bowed out after Trump refused to let him serve on an interim basis. And the usual established Republicans who might otherwise take an interest in the job&#8212;once considered among the most prestigious in Washington&#8212;have taken their names out of consideration. (Who, after all, would want to be the next <strong>Reince Priebus</strong>?) “The only thing more broken and dysfunctional than the White House itself,” Whipple <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/626c695e8ae94837bb836de4ec842c3f?\">told</a> the Associated Press, “seems to be the search for the new White House chief of staff.”</p>\n<p>In the absence of more traditional candidates, Trump’s casting call has devolved into the familiar reality-show circus. Nearly a dozen names have been floated in the press, only to be shot down: former deputy Trump campaign manager <strong>David Bossie</strong> is firmly opposed by <strong>Jared</strong> and <strong>Ivanka,</strong> and Freedom Caucus Chairman <strong>Mark Meadows</strong> is widely disliked. Other potential candidates, including Treasury Secretary <strong>Steven Mnuchin</strong> and United States Trade Representative <strong>Robert Lighthizer,</strong> have all reportedly told people they don’t want the job. <strong>Newt Gingrich,</strong> the former House Speaker, has said so explicitly. In an undeniable sign of how desperate the search has become, there has even been talk of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/after-firing-john-kelly-trump-has-no-plan-b\">bringing back Priebus</a>, my colleague <strong>Gabriel Sherman</strong> reports. (It appears Priebus will be <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/former-trump-chief-of-staff-reince-priebus-selected-to-join-navy-with-backing-from-mattis/2018/12/14/b12c269e-ffb4-11e8-83c0-b06139e540e5_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.b94079013a11\">joining the Navy</a>, instead.)</p>\n<p>And yet, the chief-of-staff search continues to take more soap-operatic turns. According to the Huffington Post, Jared Kushner has also expressed interest in the job, and on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-chief-of-staff-jared-kushner_us_5c12c616e4b0f60cfa277b93\">met with Trump</a> to discuss it. That’s surprising enough on its own: as Trump scryer <strong>Maggie Haberman</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1073371750031872000\">noted</a>, it would be uncharacteristic of Kushner, who prefers to work behind the scenes, to suddenly pursue a title in the public eye. More baffling is the candidate Trump reportedly met with next: former New Jersey governor <strong>Chris Christie,</strong> who was (briefly) considered a front-runner. “[He’s] tough; he’s an attorney; he’s politically savvy, and one of Trump’s early supporters,” a source familiar with Trump’s thinking <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-am-dac51e76-8f2b-4835-98ed-1d7ba80437f0.html\">told</a> <strong>Jonathan Swan</strong> of Axios.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more important, from the First Family’s perspective, was the fact that Christie, as U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, prosecuted Kushner’s father on 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering, and making illegal campaign donations. <strong>Charles Kushner</strong> ultimately served 14 months at a federal prison camp in Alabama. Later, Kushner reportedly took his revenge by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/politics/trump-transition-jared-kushner-chris-christie/index.html\">ousting Christie from the Trump transition team</a>, spiking his chances of joining the administration.</p>\n<p>On Friday, Christie <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1073639618774482945\">released</a> a statement explaining that he had taken himself out of the running (whether he was ever offered the job is unclear). “It’s an honor to have the president consider me as he looks to choose a new White House chief-of-staff,” he wrote. “However, I’ve told the president that now is not the right time for me or my family to undertake this serious assignment.” Had Trump simply taunted Christie, once again, with the prospect of a White House job, only to jilt a former rival? Did the president’s resentful son-in-law use his family veto power to block the appointment of the man who humiliated his father? Perhaps it was the opposite: later Friday afternoon, <em>The Washington Post</em>’s <strong>Josh Dawsey</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdawsey1/status/1073640961870348288\">reported</a> that “people close to Christie” were resentful that Trump “had toyed with him” by passing him over for vice president and attorney general, and knocking him off the transition team. Multiple White House aides and advisers had told Dawsey that Christie was a front-runner for the job (“POTUS was quite interested”)&#8212;right up until the moment that Christie declined. (There is also the small matter of Christie’s soon-to-be published <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/hachette-books/hachette-books-announces-the-acquisition-of-a-no-holds-barred-memoir-from-outspoken-former-new-jersey-governor-presidential-candidate-and-trump-transition-chair-chris-christie/\">memoir</a>, which promises “frank appraisals” of Trump associates, including Kushner.) The enduring mystery of the Trump-Christie relationship, not to mention the job search, goes on.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Mick Mulvaney has won the chief-of-staff bake-off, on an interim basis.</em></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/jdawsey1/status/1073705029964623872\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdawsey1/status/1073705029964623872\">https://twitter.com/jdawsey1/status/1073705029964623872</a></p></blockquote></div><h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The Democrats are facing a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/democrats-face-a-generational-reckoning?inline\">generational reckoning</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; How a movie producer and Hollywood invented <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/how-hollywood-invented-ben-shapiro?inline\">conservative commentator Ben Shapiro</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Real estate, greed, extortion: a true <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/12/jills-miami-real-estate-extortion?inline\">tale of <em>Miami Vice</em></a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Sandra Bland’s sisters are still searching for <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/say-her-name-sandra-bland-documentary-interview\">answers about her death</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; It sure looks like Saudi Arabia <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/trump-hotel-saudi-arabia?inline\">used veterans to funnel money to Trump</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Trump White House","socialTitle":"Did Kushner Veto Christie as White House Chief of Staff?","socialDescription":"Or did Christie want to humiliate Trump?

The day had consisted of a blurred series of characteristically D.C. encounters (<strong>Charlie Rose,</strong> <strong>Dick Cheney,</strong> <strong>Mark Leibovich</strong>); the heady aura that accompanies being in a room with three living presidents; and, of course, unremitting heartache as I watched my friend eulogize her father. But John McCain’s funeral felt bigger than any of that. It seemed as though we were laying to rest not just ​<em>this</em> man, but a kind of man, and with it, what it meant to be a conservative.</p>\n<p>On the day of a historic election, it remains to be seen whether McCain’s brand of conservatism has truly become a relic. Even before his death, the G.O.P. had begun to spiral, embracing tariffs and a trillion-dollar spending bill; courting white supremacists and anti-Semites; and bolstering an administration ​whose résumé includes a horrific child-separation policy, a troubling obsequiousness to world dictators, and an almost gleeful disdain for the truth. <strong>Donald Trump</strong> deserves neither all the credit nor all the blame. Instead, the G.O.P. made what <em>The Washington Post</em> has called a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2018/04/08/trump-has-nothing-more-to-deliver-for-the-gop-so-why-not-dump-him/?utm_term=.156e0e0bc6e0\">“Faustian bargain”</a> with Trump, using his esoteric populism as a blunt instrument to achieve strategic aims while ignoring entire issues altogether. “They would look the other way on personal finances and corruption and disregard his racist, anti-democratic outbursts for help in delivering tax cuts, a Supreme Court justice, and some deregulation,” <strong>Jennifer Rubin</strong> wrote. Various lawmakers have accepted this. “People don’t like this, don’t like that, don’t like that,” Rep. <strong>Peter King</strong> <a href=\"http://www2.philly.com/philly/news/politics/for-traditional-republicans-immigration-tariffs-show-risks-of-silent-bargain-with-trump-20180625.html\">told</a> the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer,</em> “but then the bottom line is they accept him. To me, clearly on balance, the president has gotten results.”</p>\n<p>This bargain theory, though, is incomplete at best. There would have been no nose-holding had the party rejected Trump early on and backed a bona-fide conservative who believed in its principles. Boxing out Trump might not have prevented his election, but it would have insulated the party from the deranged warping it has endured. Republicans didn’t merely assume ownership of Trump, though&#8212;they begged him for the pleasure. In September 2015, more than a year before the election, then-Republican National Committee chairman <strong>Reince Priebus</strong> flew to New York to hand-deliver a loyalty pledge for Trump to sign, promising to run as a Republican if he became the nominee. “We were absolutely furious,” a former Bush staffer told <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/2016-gop-convention-reince-priebus-donald-trump-214078\">Politico</a> of the loyalty-pledge fiasco. “It was a total affront to us, because [the R.N.C.] was no longer calling balls and strikes&#8212;they were actually helping him.”</p>\n<p>The party’s kowtowing to Trump has left it in an uncomfortable position, with a president whose approval numbers are as low as <strong>George W. Bush’s</strong> in 2006, but startlingly high among Republicans. Yet even if they do lose the House, it’s hard to argue Republicans&#8212;who control the presidency, the judiciary, and, more than likely, the Senate&#8212;aren’t doing well. Conservatism, however, is another matter. And Trump’s influence has left movement conservatives disoriented.</p>\n<p>Some, like <strong>George Will</strong> and <strong>Max Boot,</strong> have left the Republican party altogether. Others have chosen to stay. To them, conservatism is a fixed value set, regardless of whether or not it is attached to a political party, or ascendant among voters. “President Trump has been a disruptive force in American politics, but he has not fundamentally changed conservatism,” <strong>Arthur Brooks,</strong> the outgoing president of American Enterprise Institute and a reliably measured voice, told me. “The electorate in general, not just the G.O.P., has become more open to populist politics, but this is due just as much to the financial crisis of 2008 as it is to the president . . . We shouldn’t mistake a rise in populist sentiment for a fundamental change in conservatism.”</p>\n<p>Experts are less certain. “Political schools like conservatism absolutely can change significantly over time,” said Stanford University associate professor of history <strong>Jennifer Burns.</strong> “Even if a political movement has a well-articulated set of first principles, as does conservatism, the way these principles are interpreted, emphasized, and ordered can change significantly.” She offers two historic examples. The first was the transformation of classical liberalism in the 1930s as a result of the Great Depression, when it embraced more government intervention. The second was the shift in conservatism from isolationism to intellectual interventionism&#8212;in short, the arrival of the neocon.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>In 1970, much like the rest of the country, conservatism was attempting to regain its footing after a decade of tumult. Richard Nixon had been president just a year and was announcing withdrawals from a failed war in Vietnam. In the midst of these developments, two giants of political discourse were engaged in an argument of sorts. Irving Kristol, later dubbed the “godfather of neoconservatism,” and Friedrich Hayek, whose <em>Road to Serfdom</em> sits atop the conservative canon, considered whether capitalism in a free society can engender real equality. As Kristol <a href=\"https://www.nationalaffairs.com/public_interest/detail/when-virtue-loses-all-her-loveliness-some-reflections-on-capitalism-and-the-free-society\">wrote</a> in an essay, “The average working man in nineteenth-century America had far fewer ‘rights’ than his counterpart today; but he was far more likely to boast about his being a free man.”</p>\n<p>Thanks to dialogues like these, two important consecutive things happened. First, a group of disaffected liberal intellectuals, who had embraced de-segregation and the civil-rights movement but were growing wary of foreign-policy fads like détente, Great Society welfare-state policies, and anti-Semitism within the Black Power movement, birthed neoconservatism. Second, while neoconservatism hardly brought the distinct factions of the American right together, it did create a coalition point. In an increasingly messy Venn diagram of conservatism, it would eventually form the common intersection of once-rival intraparty interests, giving safe harbor to pro-Israel Christians, free-market capitalists, neoliberal hawks, and the kind of populism that would become foundational to the modern Republican Party.</p>\n<p>Most conservatives look back on these growing pains with pride&#8212;such competition of ideas only strengthened conservatism, giving it an intellectual and moral heft that helped cement the modern Republican archetype in the image of Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, <strong>Mitt Romney,</strong> and <strong>Nikki Haley.</strong> So, could this be another defining moment? The optimistic view might be that arguments between Trump Republicans, never-Trumpers, social conservatives, evangelicals, Trump isolationists, and McCain hawks are merely an agitation of orthodoxy after which conservatism will become more robust. Imagine if Max Boot, <strong>Ben Shapiro,</strong> George Will, <strong>Jeff Flake,</strong> <strong>Paul Ryan,</strong> Arthur Brooks, and <strong>Alan Dershowitz</strong> had an intellectual baby: conservatism wouldn’t moderate, per se, but it might re-discover its basic humanity, its sharp eye for hypocrisy, and its affinity for free enterprise.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the intellectual offspring of <strong>Steve King,</strong> <strong>Ann Coulter,</strong> and <strong>Tomi Lahren</strong> would make conservatism and nationalism virtually indistinguishable. Right now, so much depends on which conservative genes become dominant and which become recessive. Package bombs and synagogue shootings are, thankfully, anomalies, but no one can argue that white nationalism, anti-Semitism, and racism have found a climate of comfort in this president and, by extension, the party he represents.</p>\n<p>The more realistic view is that what’s happening now looks nothing like what happened then. Though the inflection points are similar&#8212;race, power, trade&#8212;the motives are not. For the conservative intellectuals of the 60s and 70s, the point was to put long-held political, economic, social, geopolitical, and cultural theories through a series of rigorous exercises to evaluate whether they continued to hold up as the world modernized around them. Today’s Republicans are not re-evaluating protectionist trade policies or the prudence of exploding the debt and deficit because they are any less certain of their positions. They’re pushing pause to appease a president who doesn’t know any better.</p>\n<p>The other marked difference between then and now is the conservative emphasis on coalition-building. By the early 1960s, Barry Goldwater had given conservatives a road map to unite around that which extended beyond a fear of Communism. “After that, conservatives stopped fighting about who they really were, and learned to live with the contradictions of their movement,” Burns said. Trump, on the other hand, “seems to be running the tape in reverse. There was no consensus around Trump.”</p>\n<p>William F. Buckley Jr. picked up where Goldwater left off, building a bigger conservative tent by marginalizing specific elements that were antithetical to growth. “Buckley very deliberately purged the conservative movement of isolationists and nationalists and elevated intellectuals like [Milton] Friedman who were forward-looking, open-minded, and intellectually respected even by their opponents,” Burns said. “The closest thing to Buckley [now] is <strong>Steve Bannon,</strong> and he is trying to do the opposite: bring into the mainstream the very same elements Buckley pushed to the fringe.”</p>\n<p>Hence the anxiety. “The relatively broad consensus of the past&#8212;that conservatism was defined by the three legs of the Reagan Republican stool (limited government, strong defense, and cultural conservatism)&#8212;is now over,” <em>National Review</em> writer <strong>David French</strong> told me. “The conservative movement has always had its divisions, but they’re as stark as they’ve ever been. We’re divided over policy, over the importance of culture over politics, and, of course, over the person and personality of Donald Trump.”</p>\n<p>French is right, although “divided” implies that both sides&#8212;pro-Trump and anti-Trump Republicans&#8212;hold differing views on the same subject. But the intraparty debate isn’t over whether Trump’s policies are sound&#8212;it’s over whether that even matters. Pro-Trump Republicans, including most Republican lawmakers, say it does not. If that’s not a crisis of conscience and identity, then I don’t know what is.</p>\n<p>It’s also, incidentally, a branding crisis. A <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/225074/conservative-lead-ideology-down-single-digits.aspx\">2017 Gallup poll</a> found that the gap between Americans’ preferred description of their political views&#8212;liberal or conservative&#8212;is narrowing significantly. While 35 percent preferred the term conservative to the 26 percent who preferred liberal, the 9-point margin has shrunk from 11 points in 2016 and roughly 20 points in years past. Just 12 percent of millennials have consistently or mostly conservative attitudes, according to a <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2018/03/01/the-generation-gap-in-american-politics/\">Pew study</a> in 2017, the lowest of any generation.</p>\n<p>Whether conservatism is fixed or not is important&#8212;but so is perception. “Trump has changed how people perceive conservatism, and could well change what conservatism is. That’s because he has the power to play up certain strains of conservatism and punish others,” Burns said. Which brings me back to John McCain. As lost as many movement conservatives are, they may take comfort in the fact that history won’t judge McCain by Trump’s standards. As much as Trump attempted to re-frame McCain’s legacy for his own use&#8212;“He’s a war hero because he was captured,” the president sneered during his campaign&#8212;it remains fixed, just like conservatism. In the end, neither the man nor the movement will truly disappear.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Midterm Elections 2018","socialTitle":"The Conservative Coma","socialDescription":"On the day of a historic election, the question remains: will John McCain’s brand of politics survive on the right?

House counsel Don McGahn’s interviews with Mueller have rattled Trump to his core. “Total meltdown,” one outside adviser said of his mood, while a Republican ally described him as “extremely frustrated.”","body":"<p>In recent weeks, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has privately expressed doubts about White House lawyer <strong>Don McGahn’s</strong> loyalty. Trump has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/is-trump-ready-to-cook-giuliani\">vented</a> to aides that McGahn doesn’t support the House Freedom Caucus’s quixotic campaign to impeach Deputy Attorney General <strong>Rod Rosenstein</strong>&#8212;a bank shot that would leave <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> unprotected. McGahn has also clashed with Trump’s personal attorney, <strong>Rudy Giuliani,</strong> whom one Republican said McGahn “hates with the intensity of 1,000 burning suns.” There has been talk of Trump replacing McGahn with his outside lawyer <strong>Emmet Flood.</strong></p>\n<p>But <em>The New York Times</em>’ revelation that McGahn had spoken for more than 30 hours with Mueller’s investigators has rattled Trump and the West Wing to the core, according to three of Trump’s outside advisers, causing Trump to ratchet up his Twitter war on Mueller to new heights. Over the weekend, <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> described Trump’s mood as “rip-shit,” according to one of the advisers. “Total meltdown” was how another adviser put it. “He’s extremely frustrated,” a Republican close to the White House said.</p>\n<p>The biggest fear rippling through the West Wing is that no one knows what McGahn told Mueller during his multiple interviews. “Trump didn’t know how many hours it was,” one Republican briefed on Trump’s thinking said. Last night, <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mcgahn-does-not-believe-he-implicated-trump-in-wrongdoing-in-special-counsel-interviews-his-attorney-tells-presidents-legal-team/2018/08/20/37209d28-a49f-11e8-a656-943eefab5daf_story.html\">reported</a> that McGahn’s lawyer, <strong>Bill Burck,</strong> has been doing damage control, telling the White House that McGahn did not “incriminate” Trump. That’s provided little solace to Trump and West Wing aides. “You have to understand McGahn kept notes on <em>every</em> single meeting with Trump,” one former West Wing official said. “There’s no way this guy is going to protect him.” (A person close to McGahn disputed that McGahn took extensive notes of his meetings with Trump, but added that McGahn has only provided Trump’s lawyers a “high-level summary” of his comments to Mueller.) Trump also views McGahn as a “<strong>[Reince] Priebus</strong> guy,” shorthand for being a member of the Republican establishment of which Trump remains suspicious.</p>\n<p>Since news broke of McGahn’s extensive cooperation with Mueller, Trump has been lashing out on Twitter. “He’s got to frame the narrative. He thinks the media is like a shark: you’re either feeding it or it eats you,” one Republican close to the White House said. Privately, Trump blames his precarious position on the people who work for him. Trump’s fury at Attorney General <strong>Jeff Sessions,</strong> already raging, has been stoked thanks to Sessions’s refusal to resign after months of public abuse. “You can’t talk to Trump without him bringing up Sessions,” one adviser said.</p>\n<p>Trump’s frustration with Sessions has even caused him to turn on Giuliani. Over the weekend, Trump blamed Giuliani for the entire Russia probe. According to a person to whom the conversation was described, Trump loudly said to his lawyer: “It’s your fault! I offered you attorney general, but you insisted on being secretary of state. Had I picked you none of this would be happening.” (The White House declined to comment.)</p>\n<p>A lot of what’s driving Trump’s ire, White House advisers said, is Trump’s growing realization that his previous legal team, <strong>Ty Cobb</strong> and <strong>John Dowd,</strong> made a strategic error in waiving executive privilege to cooperate fully with Mueller. But Trump being Trump, he won’t admit to making this mistake, so he directs blame onto others. Another theory for what’s motivating Trump’s increasingly unhinged tweets is that Mueller may be closing in on his son <strong>Don Jr.</strong> “A lot of what Trump is doing is based on the fact [that] Mueller is going after Don Jr.,” a person close to the Trump family told me. “They’re squeezing Don Jr. right now.”</p>\n<p>Don Jr.’s lawyer said, “I’m not going to comment.” Another person briefed on the investigation disputed the term &quot;squeeze,&quot; but said the Mueller team continues to ask for documents.\n<em>This post has been updated.</em></p>","rubric":"White

One Republican close to the White House said Trump thinks she doesn’t defend him forcefully enough.","body":"<p>Saturday, July 28, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/07/28/trump-names-homeland-security-secretary-john-kelly-as-white-house-chief-of-staff-ousting-reince-priebus/\">marks</a> the one-year anniversary of <strong>Donald Trump</strong> hiring General <strong>John Kelly</strong> as his chief of staff. The date is significant because many West Wing staffers have assumed for months that the long-suffering Kelly intended to make it to the one-year mark before he resigned, according to Republicans close to the White House. Trump also has been operating under the impression that Kelly has one foot out the door. Earlier this year, Trump sidelined Kelly and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/01/are-trump-and-kelly-heading-for-divorce?mbid=social_twitter\">openly called him a “nutjob” to friends</a>, basically governing as if Kelly wasn’t there. Sources said Trump’s humiliation of Kelly had an intent: to get Kelly to quit.</p>\n<p>The problem for Trump is that Kelly appears to be burrowing in rather than stepping away. Earlier this month, Kelly went to the Oval Office and told Trump, “I intend to leave on my own timeline,” according to two Republicans familiar with the conversation. One Republican familiar with Kelly’s thinking said Kelly’s view is that it would be more humiliating to quit than stay, even though he’s become irrelevant in the job.</p>\n<p>The stalemate has produced a petty and toxic environment in the West Wing, where Kelly at times seems to be working at cross-purposes to his boss, and Trump openly mocks him. Cameras caught Kelly visibly grimacing as Trump harangued NATO allies during the recent summit. Last week, I <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/the-west-wing-revolts-after-trump-embraces-putin\">reported</a> that Kelly called Republicans on Capitol Hill, and encouraged them to criticize Trump’s disastrous press conference with <strong>Vladimir Putin.</strong> West Wing aides, meanwhile, have taken to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/trump-bill-shine-john-kelly-sarah-sanders\">leaving</a> Kelly off the calendar for meetings. Sources close to <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> and <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> told me the couple believes Kelly has been bad-mouthing them and leaking damaging articles about them. Sources said Trump has told his new deputy chief of staff for communications, <strong>Bill Shine,</strong> to begin overseeing White House personnel decisions&#8212;a key part of Kelly’s portfolio.</p>\n<p>Given how bad things are, it seems obvious that Trump should fire Kelly and put everyone out of their misery. What’s preventing that, a source said, is that Trump venerates Kelly’s military service and does not want to fire him; he’d rather he quits. “It’s the four stars and the Gold Star&#8212;Trump really respects that,” the Republican who spoke with Trump recently told me. Kelly is essentially calling Trump’s bluff. As Kelly twists, the shadow race for chief of staff continues. According to one former West Wing official, the two leading contenders right now are budget director <strong>Mick Mulvaney</strong> and <strong>Mike Pence’s</strong> chief of staff, <strong>Nick Ayers.</strong> Outside allies have been pushing <strong>Stephen Schwarzman’s</strong> adviser <strong>Wayne Berman.</strong></p>\n<p>Chief of staff isn’t the only high-ranking West Wing position Trump may have to fill soon. Sources told me Trump is losing patience with Press Secretary <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders,</strong> who’s already signaled she intends to leave later this year. One Republican close to the White House said Trump views Sanders as a Kelly loyalist who doesn’t defend Trump forcefully enough. Sanders refused to hold an on-camera briefing for two days during the child-separation crisis. The source added that Trump was annoyed that Sanders released a statement blaming Kelly’s grimace at the NATO summit on the slim breakfast menu. “He thought that was cheesy and lame. Trump wants fighters, not jokers,” the source said.</p>\n<p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p>","rubric":"White House","socialTitle":"“I Intend to Leave on My Own Timeline”: John Kelly Is Playing Four Corners with Trump","socialDescription":"As Kelly drags his feet, Trump is losing his patience with Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

Obama had appeared tired, irritated, on the defensive. <em>The New York Times</em> noted his “flat, uninspired” performance. Even diehard Obama fan Andrew Sullivan tweeted, “He’s boring, abstract, and”&#8212;cue the ultimate zinger&#8212;“less human-seeming than Romney.” But it was James Carville who finally put a finger on it: “It looked like President Obama didn’t really want to be there!”\n<p>The first Romney debate was a significant waypoint in Obama’s slow drift from ebullient optimist to cranky, deflated cynic, sparking speculation that he might just be over being president. Republicans from Chris Christie (“I don’t think he likes being president”) to Donald Trump (“He’s just not into it”) made note. So did the liberal media, perhaps feeling betrayed by the vanishing act of their heretofore cheerleader in chief. Salon asked in a headline, “Does Obama just hate his job?” *Harper’*s Kevin Baker reminded readers, “Barack Obama has repeatedly informed us that he hates living in the White House and can’t wait to be an ex-president.”</p>\n<p>But Obama, an indefatigable basketball fan, soon turned it around and flashed his competitive side. He roundly beat Romney in the second and third debates, before soaring through November and concluding one of the most quietly accomplished portfolios of any president in the modern era: auto-industry bailout, Wall Street reforms, new fuel-efficiency standards, increased aid to veterans, expanded F.D.A. food-safety oversight, gay marriage, getting private lenders out of the federal student-loan program, the Iran deal, and of course, the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare. Not to mention ending the war in Iraq and drawing down our presence in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>So what’s next for the Obamas? “All the strands of my life came together, and I really became a man when I moved to Chicago,” Obama said in May 2015, announcing Chicago as the future home of his presidential library and leading to speculation that the departing First Family will resettle in the Windy City. Others had predicted Hawaii, Obama’s home state, as nice a place as any to unwind. Finally, in March, Obama put an end to the guessing game: the family will remain in Washington at least until youngest daughter Sasha graduates from high school in 2019.

As the public’s attention starts to focus on the primaries of 2020&#8212;<em>God, didn’t we just do this?</em>&#8212;many Democrats are acting as if <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> who’s having a good day when his approval ratings stay in the 40s, would beat most of the field. Maybe that’s because they’re still recovering from the shock of 2016. But maybe it’s more serious than that. If today’s Democrats can’t beat Trump, then maybe <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> wasn’t as bad a candidate as her critics claimed. And if Clinton wasn’t the problem, then what was the problem? Such questions are behind a recent spike of debates on the left over <strong>Barack Obama’s</strong> record. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1078689102797492229\">More</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeGrunwald/status/1078686964566712321\">more</a> voices seem to be saying, either obliquely or bluntly, that Obama was a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1080265059576745986\">bad president</a>.</p>\n<p>Certainly, almost anyone on the left will agree that Obama was preferable to his Republican opponents. If they object to how Obama handled issues such as health care, finance capitalism, immigration, economic stimulus, trade, or war and peace, it’s not because they feel a Republican president would have been better. That makes it tempting to say that Obama is being criticized only for pushing insufficiently to the left, settling for the Affordable Care Act rather than Medicare for All or a stimulus package under a trillion dollars rather than one twice that size. But such an explanation tends to assume a difference of degree rather than kind, with Obama dwelling in a more purplish spot than his bluer critics. In reality, the categories that matter as much as left and right are those of establishment and radical. Obama’s record of siding reliably with the former at a time when the zeitgeist had come to favor the latter is the source of much of the tension over his legacy.</p>\n<p>The categories of establishment and radical are tricky to define, except to say that the former wishes to preserve much of the status quo, while the latter seeks more fundamental change. If one side is full of people with opinions on how to set the dials, the other is full of people who say we need a new instrumental panel. This creates interesting alliances of left and right, ones that are less a union of extremes&#8212;a product of what political scientists call “horseshoe theory”&#8212;and more a union of dissent. A radical is <em>not</em> an extremist, necessarily. It’s someone who believes the fundamentals are flawed.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Many of the disputes between today’s establishment and its radicals are merely continuations of where we were about 25 years ago. When <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> intervened in the war over Kosovo, in 1999, the establishment center supported him, while the outer bands of right and left opposed it. Similarly, trade agreements such as NAFTA in 1993 and GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) in 1994, passed on the strength of a broad center, while Democrats and Republicans on the edges voted no. On immigration, the center took a high-influx view while the disruptors took a more restrictive one. On business policy, the establishment center supported things like the Export-Import Bank of the United States, while the left and right radicals deplored it as a special interest or, as a candidate named Barack Obama would one day put it, corporate welfare.</p>\n<p>Several factors reduced the urgency of these divisions for about a decade. One was blistering economic growth in the late 1990s. Another was a reasonably harmonious world. Then came 9/11, which reshuffled everything but also caused the right (with plucky exceptions such as <strong>Ron Paul</strong> and the founders of <em>The American Conservative</em>) to put aside internal disputes and, for the most part, fall in line behind <strong>George W. Bush.</strong> After the failures of Iraq and other Bush policies, though, the divisions roared back to life. If there was a crystallizing moment, it was when Wall Street as we knew it was about to collapse. In the eyes of the establishment, left and right, an unforeseeable real-estate crash had threatened the survival of the country’s vibrant financial sector and, with it, the wallets and neighborhood A.T.M.s of every American. In the eyes of the radicals, our financial sector was an out-of-control predator built on a rotten edifice that was finally about to crumble. Its collapse wasn’t the threat; it was the cure. For the first time in years, an immense policy question was breaking out not between parties but within them. Among both Democrats and Republicans, an establishment wing was supporting the bailouts, while the radical wing was opposing them.</p>\n<p>This was Obama’s moment of truth, and it happened months before he was elected. Would presidential candidate Barack Obama side with the radicals? Much of his campaign rhetoric suggested he would. Or would he side with the establishment? Again, much of his campaign rhetoric suggested he would. We all know how he chose, and people will long debate whether it was right or wrong. Siding with the establishment certainly earned him plenty of defenders, and it was the safer choice. But it also came at great cost. Only <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/only-one-top-banker-jail-financial-crisis.html\">one Wall Street executive</a> ever went to prison for his part in the financial crisis. For millions of Americans, any residual trust in the competence and integrity of the ruling class was lost, and Obama had become part of the problem.</p>\n<p>From that point on, it was predictable that Obama, when forced to choose, would side with the establishment. Those who knew best told him to send a surge of troops to Afghanistan, so he did it. They told him to keep the records of detainee abuse under Bush concealed, so he hid them. They said that nationalizing the banks or prosecuting the executives would be too risky, so he avoided it. They said that our trade agreements enriched the nation, so he promoted them. They called him callous when he originally refused to intervene in Libya, so he toppled its leader.</p>\n<p>Many of these positions, welcome as they were within the Beltway, were out of sync with the mood of the country. In the 1990s, the radicals had been on the fringes, but that was no longer the case after 2008. An anti-war and anti-corporatist message sent Ron Paul riding surprisingly high in 2012, and a filibuster by <strong>Rand Paul</strong> in 2015 over the issue of drone strikes prompted even Democrats to deploy the #StandWithRand hashtag. Tea Party Republicans began to team up with Democratic union members to oppose Obama’s trade deals. Fury over the bank bailouts made its way into the congressional campaigns of Republicans and Democrats alike.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Where does this leave us, and what does it portend for Democrats in 2020? On the one hand, it’s unfair to call Barack Obama an establishment president, with all the status-quo overtones of the term. He gave us the Affordable Care Act, the stimulus, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform, an executive action for Dreamers, the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” a nuclear deal with Iran, diplomatic relations with Cuba, a climate deal in Paris, a New START treaty, a reform of student-loan programs, and two liberal Supreme Court appointments. On the other hand, many of the country’s most ominous trends proceeded apace under his watch. The financialization of the economy kept increasing. Student debt kept exploding. Trade policy kept its same priorities. Opioid addiction kept spreading. Suicide numbers kept rising. Disparities in life expectancy between rich and poor kept widening. Union membership kept declining. Illegal border-crossers kept coming. Our defense commitments kept growing. In towns like Jasper, Indiana, and Mebane, North Carolina, factory workers&#8212;a hundred here, a couple of hundred there&#8212;kept losing their middle-class jobs, outcompeted by giant Chinese mills with appalling conditions.</p>\n<p>The concise and indispensable new book <em>The Nationalist Revival,</em> by the left-leaning <strong>John B. Judis,</strong> contains one especially haunting statistic: 3.4 million jobs lost to the growth of trade with China since 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organization. For many of these forgotten Americans, Obama’s final State of the Union address lauding a manufacturing surge rang hollow, and so did his vision of making “change work for us, always extending America’s promise outward, to the next frontier, to more people.” They had already heard, many times, that “they may have to retool, they may have to re-train.” It was Bill Clinton, still a canny reader of the public, at times, who had to observe that “millions of people look at that pretty picture of America he painted and they cannot find themselves in it.”</p>\n<p>Radicalism deferred was radicalism intensified. Donald Trump is failing in countless ways, but he is, if nothing else, a radical&#8212;so much so that telling him he can’t do something makes him likelier to do it. Elizabeth Warren is betting that voters will see her as a radical, even though she’ll have to embrace Obama’s record along with her own. Joe Biden is betting that Americans are done with Trump’s experiment and wish to return to the establishment. Other Democrats, such as <strong>Cory Booker</strong> and <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> and <strong>Beto O’Rourke,</strong> seem to be betting on a bit of both&#8212;establishment-friendly economics and radical-friendly social views&#8212;assisted by charisma, youth, and identity. Each bet could win or lose, because Trump is a wild card. Still, while revolution must give way to a new establishment eventually, the mood doesn’t seem to favor it yet, and our shifts are still ongoing. (Just look at <strong>Tucker Carlson’s</strong> recent <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-mitt-romney-supports-the-status-quo-but-for-everyone-else-its-infuriating\">monologue</a> attacking our ruling class and its quest to “make the world safe for banking.” Much of it could have been delivered by <strong>Bernie Sanders.</strong>) You could say Obama spent eight years deferring a radical disruption. His tragedy is that he could have led it.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Democrats","socialTitle":"Hope vs. Change: Why Some Democrats Are Turning on Obama’s Legacy","socialDescription":"Obama was a visionary who gave us the Affordable Care Act, DACA, and the Paris deal, but many of the country’s most ominous trends also proceeded apace under his watch.

prepares to bid 2018 farewell, <strong>Barack Obama</strong> has once again joined in a favorite Internet tradition, holding strong opinions about his favorite books, songs, and movies of the year. (Former presidents&#8212;they’re just like us!) As Obama explained in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/barackobama/posts/10156393283416749\">Facebook post</a>, the ritual of making a list is a favorite of his, as it affords him a moment to reflect on some of his favorite art. He added, in a subtle post-presidential flex, “It also gives me a chance to highlight talented authors, artists, and storytellers&#8212;some who are household names and others who you may not have heard of before.” Overall, Obama’s taste is quintessentially “cool dad”&#8212;it’s rife with picks that run the gamut of style and aesthetic, with a few well-chosen surprises peppered throughout. The author of his top book of the year, however, is adorably obvious.</p>\n<p>His book list was divided into books by authors who have appeared on earlier lists and those by his new favorites. At the top, of course, was <strong>Michelle Obama’s</strong> <em>Becoming</em>&#8212;with the parenthetical note, “obviously my favorite!” Other picks included literary fiction and nonfiction, such as <strong>Tayari Jones’s</strong> <em>An American Marriage</em>&#8212;an Oprah’s Book Club 2018 selection as well&#8212;<em>Futureface: A Family Mystery, an Epic Quest, and the Secret to Belonging</em> by <strong>Alex Wagner,</strong> <em>Warlight</em> by <strong>Michael Ondaatje,</strong> <em>Feel Free</em> by <strong>Zadie Smith,</strong> and <em>Florida</em> by <strong>Lauren Groff.</strong> (Notably, Groff’s <em>Fates and Furies</em> also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/10/obama-favourite-book-of-2015-lauren-groff-fates-and-furies\">topped</a> Obama’s 2015 list.) He also included some of the nonfiction that intrigued political commentators like <strong>David Brooks</strong> and <strong>Ezra Klein</strong> this year: <em>Factfulness</em> by <strong>Hans Rosling,</strong> <em>How Democracies Die</em> by <strong>Steven Levitsky</strong> and <strong>Daniel Ziblatt,</strong> and <em>Why Liberalism Failed</em> by <strong>Patrick Deneen.</strong></p>\n<p>Obama’s film picks for the year are an equally versatile blend of blockbusters and indie projects: <em>Annihilation</em>, <em>Black Panther</em>, <em>BlacKkKlansman</em>, <em>Blindspotting</em>, <em>Burning</em>, <em>The Death of Stalin</em>, <em>Eighth Grade</em>, <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em>, <em>Leave No Trace</em>, <em>Minding the Gap</em>, <em>The Rider</em>, <em>Roma</em>, <em>Shoplifters</em>, <em>Support the Girls</em>, and <em>Won’t You Be My Neighbor?</em> He declined to weigh in on whether or not he believes it’s essential to watch <em>Roma</em> in a movie theater, or if it’s O.K. to simply stream it at home. He left one of the most raucously funny films of 2018, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/02/game-night-rachel-mcadams-review\"><em>Game Night</em></a>, off his list&#8212;but something tells us the Internet and <strong>Jesse Plemons</strong> will forgive him.</p>\n<p>But it’s the music portion of the list that showcases Obama’s increasingly strong “cool dad” persona like a pair of sensible, relaxed-fit jeans. Yes, there are the more expected song picks for any music aficionado&#8212;including “Make Me Feel” from <strong>Janelle Monáe’s</strong> <em>Dirty Computer</em> and “Apeshit” by The Carters. Cardi B’s infectiously joyous “I Like It” and Courtney Barnett’s “Need a Little Time” also made the list. And then there’s “One Trick Ponies” by Kurt Vile, “Wait by the River” by Lord Huron, and “Nina Cried Power” by Hozier. “And in honor of one of the great jazz singers of all time, who died this year,” Obama wrote as he closed his list, “a classic album: <em>The Great American Songbook</em> by Nancy Wilson.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8211; Is this the end of <a

Less than one week after her victory in the midterm elections, after all, A.O.C. had joined environmental activists in a protest in Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi’s</strong> office. Later, on a call with the progressive group Justice Democrats, she encouraged activists to support an effort to primary Democratic House incumbents. Then, during the first week of the 116th Congress, Ocasio-Cortez dropkicked leadership by taking a stand against the House rules package. Many Democratic caucus-goers wondered if she was more interested in building a grassroots movement or establishing her own political brand than passing collaborative legislation. As one congressional aide to a progressive House Democrat characterized it to me, “a cloud” hovered over Ocasio-Cortez after the elections.</p>\n<p>Months later, however, much of that skepticism has dissipated. Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides I spoke with over the past week see A.O.C. as a charismatic young lawmaker eager to learn the ropes and build relationships. The progressive aide, who has had multiple interactions with the freshman lawmaker, described her as having “an incredible Obama-esque factor” when connecting with people but surprisingly lacking an ego. The first congressional aide echoed the sentiment. “She has a willingness to work with people and develop positive relationships, and I think we should let her do her job for a little while and wait to determine if she is going to be a flamethrower or someone who will do more and do something real,” this person told me. “I think there are other members that can be more of a pain than A.O.C.”</p>\n<p>Notably, some suggested, Ocasio-Cortez has accrued praise by handling herself admirably in the face of criticism, which has occasionally been laced with overt sexism&#8212;such as <em>Washington Examiner</em> reporter <strong>Eddie Scarry’s</strong> widely criticized tweet that her wardrobe betrayed her socialist street cred. (“I think a lot of members think that she is probably being treated unfairly,” another congressional aide told me.) Sources I spoke with said Democrats were also encouraged by comments from A.O.C. that suggested she was backing away from threats to primary more centrist colleagues. (“I’m focused on my job,” she <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/11/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-democrats-establisment-1093728\">told</a> Politico.) Moreover, others have been impressed by her swift mastery of procedure. Late last year, <strong>Elijah Cummings,</strong> chairman of the House Oversight Committee, specifically requested that A.O.C. be tapped to serve on said committee, hoping that she would ask the questions no one else was. “A lot of people said that she might not be a team player, and I have found it to be just the opposite,” he told me. “She has been a breath of fresh air.”</p>\n<p>Cummings acknowledged the disruptive nature of the new Congress; the freshman class will at times be at odds with other members of the Democratic caucus. Congresswoman <strong>Rashida Tlaib</strong> of Michigan launched a 24-hour news cycle when she declared she wanted to “impeach the motherfucker,” in reference to Trump. Tlaib and <strong>Ilhan Omar</strong> of Minnesota have also stoked controversy with their criticism of Israel&#8212;notably putting them at odds with some Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on which Omar sits. Just last week, Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib, Omar, and Congresswoman <strong>Ayanna Pressley,</strong> another freshman, signed a letter calling on the bipartisan conference committee negotiating a border security deal to cut, not increase, funding for the Department of Homeland Security and, specifically, the ICE and C.P.B. agencies&#8212;a move certain to complicate the negotiation effort.</p>\n<p>But Cummings suggested that disagreement within the ranks is a considerable strength. “It is important that you have people like her&#8212;not only on my committee, but in the Congress&#8212;to remind folks of who we are, who we are as the Democratic Party, and who we have been for many years,” he explained. “And so, sure, when you do that like Ms. Cortez, you may ruffle a few feathers, but I think that, in the end, it will make us a better and stronger party.”</p>\n<p>Last week, during a House Oversight Committee hearing on the cost of prescription drugs, the freshman congresswoman presented as measured and methodical as she probed the relationship between drug manufacturers and taxpayer-backed organizations like the National Institutes of Health. “She asked the best set of questions of anybody in her five minutes,” Cummings said, noting that the New York congresswoman stayed for the entire hearing, which stretched beyond the five-hour mark. “It was clear that she had done her homework.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>After years of Republican infighting on Capitol Hill, Trump allies have seized on this new, disruptive era in progressive politics as evidence that the Democratic Party, too, is in disarray. Right-wing media has eagerly latched on to these policy divisions, casting A.O.C. as the ringleader of a band of insurgents. Democrats I spoke with, however, argued that there have always been progressives and centrists under the party banner. Others pointed to the unified messaging around the shutdown as evidence that these tensions were overblown. “Maybe right-wing media is so sick of their Freedom Caucus thwarting everything they want to do that they finally want to create that sentiment here. I just don’t think it is going to happen,” the first congressional aide told me.</p>\n<p>The freshman class is under no delusion that there is a one-size-fits-all approach to promoting progressive policy. “Every member of the freshman class has their own politics and their own experience,” an aide to a freshman lawmaker told me. But, they added, “there is tremendous kinship and excitement about this class. I honestly don’t give too much credence to the narrative around divisions.”</p>\n<p>Underlying the various narratives surrounding A.O.C. and other members of the Democratic freshman class is a recognition of their power. <strong>Steve Doocy,</strong> <strong>Ainsley Earhardt,</strong> and <strong>Brian Kilmeade</strong> wouldn’t waste airtime attacking her, Tlaib, and Omar if they didn’t recognize that these women are threats to the ideology they seek to promote every morning. It is not unlike how the Republican Party has spent billions of dollars disparaging Pelosi, whose skills as a master legislator were on full display during the shutdown. (Two sources suggested to me that Pelosi likely sees herself in Ocasio-Cortez.)</p>\n<p>A.O.C. and her fellow progressives have already had an indelible impact on the national political discourse, despite only being in office a few weeks. Since Ocasio-Cortez floated a 70 percent marginal tax rate on income over $10 million during a <em>60 Minutes</em> interview, the proposal has emerged as a talking point for potential 2020 hopefuls. According to one recent poll, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/425422-a-majority-of-americans-support-raising-the-top-tax-rate-to-70\">59 percent</a> of registered American voters support the plan&#8212;including 45 percent of Republicans. Similarly, while A.O.C.’s bold yet publicly undefined Green New Deal initially drew criticism and caused some turmoil within the Democratic Party, it has quickly emerged as something of a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-green-new-deal-a-green-new-deal-whatever-it-is-2020-democrats-support-it/2019/01/30/a75166d4-2340-11e9-ad53-824486280311_story.html\">progressive litmus test</a> for the Democratic field. “She is a Democrat and she is a strong, vocal advocate for our agenda,” the third congressional aide told me. “I think while initially fearful&#8212;and maybe even right to be fearful because of some of the early things that were going on&#8212;she has now come into her own and realized that she has a lot of power.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"House Democrats","socialTitle":"How A.O.C.

But Biden has other ideas.","body":"<p>Word of <strong>Barack Obama’s</strong> mid-November meeting with <strong>Beto O’Rourke</strong> cheered the millions of O’Rourke fans who want the Texas congressman to run for president in 2020. And it delighted the political pundit-verse, which is always hungry for new gossip and intrigue. <strong>Joe Biden,</strong> however, is said to have been less than thrilled. Obamaworld insiders describe the former vice president as upset&#8212;not specifically by Obama’s conversation with O’Rourke, but by the former president’s willingness to talk to other plausible Democratic contenders while Biden is still deciding whether to run himself. “This is unequivocally false. Period,” Biden spokesman <strong>Bill Russo says.</strong> So just how does Biden feel about his ex-boss chatting with potential primary rivals? “I’m not going to comment further,” Russo replies.</p>\n<p>Obama has nothing against Biden&#8212;in fact, he still loves Amtrak Joe, according to a person familiar with the ex-president’s thinking. And Obama has been strict about not publicizing who has sounded him out. But he does not want to repeat what he considers a mistake from 2016, when the Democratic establishment wrapped its arms around <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> as the party’s nominee early in the process. “He contrasts that with 2008, when he came out of the primaries and he’d been to all 50 states and he was fucking ready to take on John McCain,” one former Obama advisor says. “So his position this time is, ‘If you’re serious and you want to talk, I’ll talk to you.’ As things unfold, he might say, ‘Let’s all stay focused.’ But he’s not going to pick a winner.”</p>\n<p>Obama’s current wide-open approach must feel painfully ironic to Biden: four years ago he was one of the prospective candidates being pressured to stand down in favor of Clinton. In August, 2015, not long after the death of Biden’s 46-year-old son, Beau, and with talk escalating that Biden might jump into the race, Obama’s longtime senior political advisor, <strong>David Axelrod,</strong> went on the <em>Today</em> show to say he would advise against a Biden run. “I know what it takes to put a presidential campaign together, and it is late in the game,” Axelrod said, sending an unmistakable message. “Secretary Clinton, for all her problems, some of them self-inflicted, still has a very high rating among Democrats, and that of course is what determines who the nominee will be, and a big head start.” Now a CNN poll of Iowa shows Biden far ahead of second place <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong>&#8212;yet Biden isn’t being given the same deference.</p>\n<p>“If the institutional players had limited their time and advice to a couple of handpicked candidates in 2006 and 2007, Obama wouldn’t have had an opportunity to move forward,” says <strong>John Del Cecato,</strong> a Democratic strategist who began advising then-Illinois state senator Obama in 2004, and who worked on both of Obama’s successful presidential campaigns. “I know President Obama has tremendous respect for Biden. But he also appreciates the dark-horse candidates, or those who haven’t been as plugged in.” Obama’s experience also shapes his view that a long haul of contested primaries ultimately produces a sharper general election candidate. “When we lost New Hampshire in 2008 and we were all so depressed, Obama was very zen about the whole thing,” Del Cecato says. “Not that he wanted to be set back on his heels, but it’s one thing to have campaigned successfully in a couple of places. He thinks the nomination is something that should be earned.”</p>\n<p>Biden is 76, and he has been a national political figure since 1973. With the party’s momentum moving toward younger, non-white, female, more liberal candidates, one top Democratic strategist believes Biden is actually better off with Obama talking to other presidential aspirants now. “If I were Biden, I wouldn’t want to be in a situation where Obama is saying, ‘Look, you’ve got to be for my VP.’ Democrats don’t like to be told who to vote for,” the consultant says. “Many people lined up behind Sanders in 2016 because they didn’t want to be told to support Hillary. Biden doesn’t want to fall into that trap, to have Obama embrace him too exclusively, too early.”</p>\n<p>A second strategist, who works for a likely Democratic contender, understands why Obama’s flirtations may sting Biden’s ego. But this strategist doesn’t believe the former president will end up having much real influence on who emerges from the crowded 2020 field. “If Obama is playing footsie with people now, it creates tension,” the advisor says. “And it gets you some media attention and maybe some staffing. But actual voters? Obama himself has always been popular with Democrats, but I’ve never seen his popularity be transferrable to someone else.” Don’t kid yourself, though: Biden, and all the others, would love any wink, nod, or blessing Obama might bestow.</p>","rubric":"2020","socialTitle":"Obama Has Flirted with Beto, and Biden Is Not Happy","socialDescription":"The former president wants to avoid the mistakes of 2016, when the field was cleared for Hillary.

but one of <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> most shocking claims about a southern border wall has proven a bit exaggerated. The president claimed in Friday’s bizarre Rose Garden presser that several of his predecessors “have told me that we should have” built a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, though he declined to name which former presidents supported it. Perhaps unsurprisingly, representatives for the Bush family and <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> have denied the allegation.</p>\n<p>“This should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me, and they all know it,” Trump said. “Some of them have told me that we should have done it.”</p>\n<p>Clinton spokesperson <strong>Angel Ureña</strong> explicitly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/04/trump-former-presidents-border-wall-1082562\">refuted</a> the president’s assertion, adding that the two men have “not talked since the inauguration.” Bush representative <strong>Freddy Ford</strong> said the wall has never been discussed between the two. Former president George H.W. Bush <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/george-hw-bush-dead-at-94\">died in November</a>, though it is seen as unlikely that he and Trump had any significant discussion of a wall. Trump has famously kept his distance from the Bush family in the wake of past comments and a 2016 presidential campaign rivalry with <strong>Jeb Bush.</strong> Trump did not attend the funeral of former First Lady Barbara Bush in April.</p>\n<p>That just leaves former presidents <strong>Barack Obama</strong> and <strong>Jimmy Carter,</strong> both of whom have criticized Trump’s positions on immigration. An Obama spokesperson reportedly declined comment, though Obama himself has come out against the wall on numerous occasions. Carter, like Obama, has pushed for technological advancements to strengthen U.S. border security, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/trump-wall-shutdown.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, but not the kind of wall that Trump is seeking $5 billion to build. A senior administration official reportedly suggested that Trump was “referring to public comments his predecessors have made about the need for border security, not necessarily for a wall specifically.”</p>","rubric":"Wall Tales","socialTitle":"Former Presidents Deny Supporting Border Wall, Despite Trump Claims","socialDescription":"Neither Bush nor Clinton ever shared Trump’s desire

All four major broadcast networks, as well as Fox News, Fox Business, MSNBC, PBS, and CNN, will air the address&#8212;which, in some cases, will involve bumping programming. <em>Black-ish, The Gifted, FBI, Splitting Up Together,</em> and <em>Ellen’s Game of Games</em> will <a href=\"https://www.tvguide.com/news/president-trump-address-tuesday-fbi-blackish/\">all have to wait</a> for the president to finish his speech, in which he will likely stoke immigration fears with racist rhetoric and false or misleading statements.</p>\n<p>Trump announced the speech on Twitter Monday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1082347305699889157\">writing</a>, “I am pleased to inform you that I will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border.” The speech will begin at 9 P.M., and Trump is also expected to travel to the border on Thursday. CBS told <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/424258-democrats-demand-air-time-to-counter-trumps-border-speech\"><em>The Hill</em></a> that the White House said the speech would last a maximum of eight minutes.</p>\n<p>For a few hours on Monday, networks <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/07/media/networks-trump-border-security-speech/index.html\">wrung their hands</a> over whether to air the speech&#8212;but before long, CBS acquiesced to the president’s request, with the rest soon following suit. Critics have already slammed the networks for caving to Trump, worrying that viewers could walk away from his speech believing untrue statements&#8212;and sullying an immigration debate that’s already been poisoned by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/07/trump-administrations-misleading-spin-immigration-crime-terrorism/\">lies, exaggerations, and false narratives</a>. As <strong>Mika Brzezinski</strong> <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/morning-joe-says-networks-should-not-broadcast-trump-primetime-address-stream-of-lies/\">put it</a> on Tuesday’s <em>Morning Joe,</em> “The networks should refuse to turn over the airwaves to Donald Trump tonight for what they know objectively to be a steady stream of lies. Maybe that will stop him from debasing yet another one of our historic, solemn, and cherished presidential traditions.”</p>\n<p>Many more are grating at the apparent hypocrisy inherent in the networks’ decision to run the speech in the first place. As <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/7/18172419/trump-immigration-speech-networks-obama\">Vox</a> notes, <strong>George W. Bush</strong> was given airtime for his own immigration speech in 2006&#8212;but when <strong>Barack Obama</strong> planned to give his own speech on the same subject in 2014, the major broadcast networks chose not to air it. Obama pointed out that Bush’s speech had aired; networks countered that it had been a bipartisan address, while Obama’s intended address&#8212;which announced a series of executive actions on immigration&#8212;was “an overtly political move by the White House,” as Politico’s Playbook wrote at the time. Ultimately, big broadcast networks did not air it. As Vox points out, Trump’s speech is certain to be “overtly political” as well.</p>\n<p>So, why give Trump this platform? Perhaps it’s because, as CNN’s <strong>Brian Stelter</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/07/media/networks-trump-border-security-speech/index.html\">noted Monday</a>, Obama never made a formal request for airtime&#8212;but Trump reportedly did.</p>\n<p>“When the president of the United States asks for airtime, you’ve got to do it,” veteran anchor <strong>Ted Koppel</strong> told <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/trump-address-border-visit.html\"><em>The New York Times,</em></a> adding that he believes the networks should give Trump the benefit of the doubt. “If what he has to say is clearly just in his self-interest and does not address the greater national interest, then the next time the White House comes around, I might not be inclined to offer it.”</p>\n<p>In response to Trump’s announcement, House Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> and Senate Minority Leader <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> issued a joint statement in which they argued for equal time to respond to the president’s speech, writing, “Now that the television networks have decided to air the President’s address, which if his past statements are any indication will be full of malice and misinformation, Democrats must immediately be given equal airtime.” But as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/01/08/this-president-lies-daily-critics-demand-networks-fact-check-trumps-live-immigration-speech/\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> points out, the fairness doctrine was repealed in 1987&#8212;meaning it’s up to networks themselves to decide whether to grant Democrats time to respond on air. According to <em>The Hill,</em> Fox News, Fox Business, NBC, CBS, ABC, and CNN all intend to do so.</p>\n<p><em>This post has been updated.</em></p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Don’t call it a Dernaissance, call it <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/laura-dern-cover-story?inline\">Laura Dern’s much-deserved close-up</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Ethan Hawke gets candid about the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/ethan-hawke-kevin-spacey-harvey-weinstein-little-gold-men-interview?inline\">Weinsteins and Spaceys of the world</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; “I have a little bit of control over my destiny” <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/nicole-kidman-destroyer-big-little-lies?inline\">&#8212;Nicole Kidman</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Harrowing tales from the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/st-barths-yacht-season-pippa-middleton-jared-leto-les-moonves?inline\">St. Barth’s Yacht Convention</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The year ahead in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/the-year-ahead-in-royals-2019?inline\">British royalty</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hollywood newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Trump Broadcast","socialTitle":"Networks Will Air Trump’s Surely Inflammatory Immigration Speech . . .

href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/12/michelle-obama-book-tour-at-barclays-center\">follow-up visit</a> for her national book tour. Speaking with <strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong> onstage, Obama seemingly took inspiration from the stylish star and seriously stepped up her shoe game, wearing a pair of glittery thigh-high, $4,000 <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6514751/Michelle-Obama-dresses-impress-4-000-glittery-thigh-high-Balenciaga-boots-yellow-gown.html\">Balenciaga boots</a> paired with a yellow Balenciaga wrap dress.</p>\n<p>Obama has always been careful about her fashion choices, from these Balenciaga boots to the sensible J. Crew cardigans she often wore as First Lady. “I did know that my clothes were making a statement, I knew that was the case,” she told Parker on Wednesday, reflecting on her time in the White House. “So we decided why don’t we use this platform to uplift some young new designers who normally wouldn’t get this kind of attention, because you can change their lives, which is one of the reasons why we <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/01/michelle-obama-jason-wu-inauguration-dress\">chose Jason Wu</a> for my inaugural gown.”</p>\n<p>Though she has been gone from the White House for nearly two years, Obama is still very much in the spotlight, even sometimes unintentionally sharing it with <strong>Melania Trump.</strong> Last week, she visited Children’s Hospital Colorado on the same day that Trump visited Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C.; naturally, their two visits, where they both read to and visited children, were compared in news coverage. While Trump’s recent <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/melania-trump-says-she-does-what-i-think-is-right-despite-facing-criticism-from-the-public-media\">Fox News interview</a> followed her around the day of the hospital visit, Obama’s day was celebrated as if she had never left the White House at all. And that was nothing compared to the fervor that met <strong>Barack Obama</strong> when he made his <a

But they desperately fear another Barack Obama.","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Don’t kid yourself: President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> could absolutely win re-election. The old man is preternaturally intuitive, resilient when most would wilt, and just plain lucky. Plus, just as Ferris Bueller drove Ed Rooney insane, Trump has a knack for goading his political opponents to self-destruct. But, as I like to caution Republicans, you never know what might happen in 2020 if the Democratic Party nominates a presidential candidate who is likable, trustworthy, and . . . not under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>\n<p>Perhaps that is why, as Republicans sift through the wreckage of another Trump meltdown, the demolition of their House majority in the midterm elections two months prior, the ouster of <strong>James Mattis,</strong> and a holiday shutdown over the border wall, party operatives were spending the most wonderful time of the year trying to figure out what it’s going to take to avoid an even worse fate. For as much as some Republicans would like to see the president return to Trump Tower, they’re not willing to give up the presidency. And so, as the 2020 primary season begins, they are beginning to make a list of Democratic candidates that they think Trump can credibly beat.</p>\n<p>Without naming names, I asked several senior Republican insiders which Democrat, or Democrats, at the top of the opposition ticket would most reassure them about 2020. Without exception, <strong>Elizabeth Warren,</strong> the 69-year-old progressive senator from Massachusetts, topped every wish list. “There’s a lot of <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> in her,” said a veteran Republican operative in D.C. who hails from the Midwest and keeps a close eye on the heartland. “She’s elitist and doesn’t appear very nimble. It would be hard for her to expand her base or reach directly into Trump’s base.” Close behind were Senators <strong>Cory Booker</strong> of New Jersey and <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> of Vermont, who, technically, is not a member of the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>There’s a theme here. For all of Trump’s faults&#8212;and Republicans who make a living trying to win elections tend to be honest about most of them, albeit privately&#8212;the United States is still a center-right country, at least according to the data the G.O.P. trusts. And Trump brings a certain gravitas to the job, despite his periodic tendency to diminish the presidency. A lightweight Democratic contender too enthralled with, or captive to, leftist dogma is an opponent that even a politically pockmarked Trump can exploit.</p>\n<p>To wit, Trump’s domestic populism, fraught with cultural nativism such as it is, looks far more reasonable when stacked against dubious promises of free stuff (actually financed by the taxpayers, so, not free.) Trump’s “America First” nationalism, fraught with a troubling pullback from the post&#8211;World War II, bipartisan foreign policy consensus and disregard for America’s unique role as global protector of the liberal world order such as it is, looks less drastic when stacked against . . . a Democrat who essentially wants to do the same thing, minus the military buildup&#8212;and the tweets.</p>\n<p>But more than all of that, Republicans are happy to run against any progressive who tries to compete with Trump on Trump’s terms. Exchanging barbs on social media platforms; name-calling; questioning his capacity mentally, physically, and the like. As much as the Democratic base might be clamoring for a standard bearer to force-feed the president a dose of his own medicine, there is no beating the genuine article at the game he perfected. Trump is too quick and too shameless, and that approach offers little change to voters who want to turn the page from the chaos and anxiety that has characterized the current era. “A Democrat is not going to defeat Trump by being more brash, blustering, and strident. They will win over voters they need to retake the ‘blue wall’ states by connecting with those voters on substance but presenting an alternative to his leadership style,” a Republican consultant told me in an e-mail.</p>\n<p>Indeed, if there’s a key aspect to the fear <strong>Beto O’Rourke</strong> inspires in some Republicans, it’s the outgoing Texas congressman’s combination of sunny disposition and 21st-century social media agility. Sure, he’s unabashedly progressive, but to borrow a phrase from Vice President <strong>Mike Pence</strong>: He’s not angry about it. Nor, as it happens, does O’Rourke look down upon so-called heretics, or, if you prefer, “deplorables.”</p>\n<p>Ignore the Beto mockery prevalent in Republican circles during O’Rourke’s near upset of Senator <strong>Ted Cruz</strong> this past November. Party insiders were taking notes, and taking the 46-year-old from El Paso far more seriously than suggested by the apparent delight they took in lampooning everything about a figure who has drawn comparisons to a onetime up-and-coming Democrat named of <strong>Barack Obama.</strong> “A Democrat who can carry Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, or North Carolina is problematic,” a Republican insider from a critical swing state said. “Someone like Beto, who can campaign on the fly, raise money, and excite young voters, could put those and other states in play.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>The midterms marked a turning point in the Republican Party’s confidence in the president. During most of Trump’s time in the Oval, his job approval rating has been remarkably stable, poor but not disastrously so, averaging in the low 40s. Throughout, the president has skated from scandal to scandal, any one of which would have hobbled past administrations. As last month’s elections approached, this dynamic, reinforced by the stability of a Republican majority in the U.S. Senate that ultimately expanded by two seats, created a false sense of security about the health of the G.O.P. among many Republicans, even those less than thrilled with Trump.</p>\n<p>November 6 provoked a brutal reassessment. Republicans saw their coalition crack, and many senior strategists blame the president. As a few well-placed strategists told me for reporting I did for the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/house-republicans-clash-over-trumps-role-in-downfall-look-to-2020\"><em>Washington Examiner</em></a>, after-action polling and analysis made it clear that Trump drove away soft Republicans, college-educated Republicans, female Republicans, moderate Republicans, basically every category of Republican not firmly ensconced in Trump’s base, plus crucial independents, handing House Democrats a larger victory than most had predicted, and with it, the majority. The right Democratic presidential nominee could capitalize on that.</p>\n<p>And who is that? As often as Warren and her like-styled cohorts were mentioned as easy Trump foils, former Vice President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> was cited as among the few Democrats who many Republicans believe might dispatch the incumbent with relative ease. Is Biden progressive? Absolutely. Gaffe-prone? Duh. But he is the antithesis of Trump, with the added benefit that he’s been vetted before, and passed muster. “He wreaks calmness and normalcy, which I feel like people crave over the chaos of the Trump administration,” a Republican strategist headquartered in the Southwest said. Another Democrat who fits that bill, more than one Republican volunteered to me, unprompted: <strong>John Hickenlooper,</strong> the 66-year-old outgoing two-term governor of Colorado, former Denver mayor, and small-business owner. “One of the main disasters to avoid is to think 2016 is like 2020,” the Republican strategist based in the Southwest explained. “Trump got lucky and people held their nose against Clinton. That’s not likely to happen this time.”</p>\n<p>The problem for Republicans, lamented a seasoned G.O.P. hand in Washington, is that despite the challenges the Democrats face heading into the next election&#8212;a crowded and divisive primary and a restless base not necessarily uninterested in nominating calm, competent, and normal&#8212;“is that the Trump apologists won’t put the blame where it belongs and are burying their heads in the sand.”</p>\n<p>Of course, countless other Democrats are expected to run for president. Republicans continue to assess the developing field of candidates, many of who either remain an enigma or who engender differences of opinion as to how they would measure up against Trump. For instance, some dismiss Senator <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> of California as another radical progressive who isn’t ready for Prime Time, even if she’s right out of central casting for Democratic presidential contenders. Others see in her a shrewd operator who could realistically win the nomination and put Trump on defense the same way House Democrats put House Republicans in a bind in the midterm elections.</p>\n<p>It’s much the same for <strong>Michael Bloomberg,</strong> the billionaire media mogul and former mayor of New York City. Here’s a politician with a large enough personal fortune to outspend Trump and the Republican National Committee put together, and the wiliness to overcome his shortcomings. But some Republicans are unimpressed, saying there are few Democrats as polarizing and sure to keep the G.O.P. coalition together the way Clinton did two years ago as would the crusading anti-soda, anti-gun Bloomberg.</p>\n<p>Then there are those Republican power brokers who, amid fretting about what might happen down ticket in 2020, neither fear the formidable Democrats nor welcome the weaklings. “Fear is an interesting word because I fucking hate Trump so much,” a Republican consigliere said. “I certainly wouldn’t be sorry to see him lose.”</p>\n<p><em>David M.

He went full dragon energy <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/even-trumps-closest-republican-allies-cant-stomach-syria-decision\">in December</a> after Trump abruptly announced that he was withdrawing nearly all U.S. troops from the war-torn region (“If <strong>[Barack] Obama</strong> had done this, all of us would be going nuts because it’s such a bad idea,” he told <strong>Mike Pence</strong>), and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Emma_Dumain/status/1075760112508329987\">promised</a> to tweet at Trump every time the president mentioned Syria (“I’m not letting this go”). Unfortunately, recent events have forced Graham to take more dramatic action to get the president’s attention, such as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/20/inside-patrick-shanahans-clash-with-congress-munich-over-syria/?utm_term=.a91455067823\">describing in detail</a> to <em>The Washington Post</em> how he impressed upon Acting Defense Secretary <strong>Patrick Shanahan</strong> his fervent belief that withdrawing from Syria is “the dumbest f---ing idea” he’s ever heard.</p>\n<p>The dramatic scene reportedly unfolded last Saturday at the Munich Security Conference, where several members of the U.S. congressional delegation privately confronted Shanahan about the administration’s plans. A day earlier, Graham <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/02/15/exclusive-lindsey-graham-pitches-syria-safe-zone-to-prevent-isis-reemergence/\">told Breitbart</a>, he had personally pitched Trump on establishing a Syria “safe zone” along the border with Turkey, which would allow a percentage of U.S. troops to remain in the region as a deterrent against ISIS, joining forces with European and Kurdish allies to monitor the area. Apparently he figured he’d made inroads with the president. But when he heard about Shanahan suggesting to European allies that Trump is preparing to withdraw <em>all</em> U.S. troops from Syria, Graham exploded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Are you telling our allies that we are going to go to zero by April 30?” he asked Shanahan, according to Graham.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Yes, that’s been our direction [from the president],” Shanahan replied.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“That’s the dumbest f---ing idea I’ve ever heard,” Graham responded.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Graham then launched into a list of consequences he feared would result from a precipitous U.S. withdrawal from Syria without a follow-up plan: the Islamic State would return, Turkey would attack Kurdish forces, Iran would gain the advantage. Graham asked Shanahan if he disagreed with that analysis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“That could very well happen,” Shanahan said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Well, if the policy is going to be that we are leaving by April 30, I am now your adversary, not your friend,” Graham told the acting Pentagon chief, according to Graham. (Several other lawmakers confirmed this exchange.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After a “deer in the headlights” response, Shanahan reportedly pinned the dumb f---ing idea on his dumb boss. (Or, as the <em>Post</em> put it, “he failed to articulate a substantive response&#8212;other than to re-iterate these were Trump’s instructions.”) “Shanahan did not have a good meeting,” said Democratic Senator <strong>Sheldon Whitehouse.</strong> Fellow Democrat <strong>Bob Menendez</strong> fumed that the Trump administration was not listening to a bipartisan opposition. “[Shanahan] got a chorus of voices that basically said, ‘This is not going to work, there is a bipartisan resolve not to let this happen, and you need to send a message back to the president that there’s a combined, unified view this is not the way to go and he should change course,’” Menendez said. “[Shanahan] basically said he got the message.”</p>\n<p>Should the Shanahan intervention move the administration’s needle on Syria, perhaps persuading Trump to join a coalition of the willing to establish a safe zone, Graham would like it known that he had something to do with it. “After Iraq, not only would this be a mistake, this would be almost an unpardonable sin, in the sense that you know what can happen. This can risk his whole presidency,” Graham told the <em>Post,</em> now offering Trump the carrot. “Now, if he adjusts his policies and he does what Obama didn’t do and he holds this together, he’ll be looked at as the guy who finally got it right.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a

But the theatricality with which he tells it may be his greatest vulnerability.","body":"<p>One word pops up quickly and prominently nearly every time <strong>Cory Booker</strong> speaks publicly. “I will continue to try to be as fearlessly authentic as I can,” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/us/politics/cory-booker-2020.html\">he told <em>The New York Times</em></a> during a visit to New Hampshire in early December. “Every candidate should run on their authentic self,” Booker <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/news/cory-booker-presidency-single-man-20181214.html\">told the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em></a> later that month. A Booker ally uses the same word to describe the New Jersey senator to me: “His real, deep, authentic connection to the city of Newark informs a lot of what he’s done in D.C.”</p>\n<p><strong>Cornell Belcher</strong> laughs. The Democratic pollster believes the repetitive choice of adjective is no coincidence. “I think perhaps some of that’s been poll-tested or comes from focus groups,” he says. Which would only be due diligence, in preparation for Booker, 49, making his decision official in the next several weeks. The Booker team is certainly savvy enough to have picked up the whispering by some of his possible competitors for the 2020 presidential nomination, using a line of attack that’s been wielded against Booker for years: “I hate the word ‘authenticity,’” one rival strategist says. “But he seems so hammed up.”</p>\n<p>Booker’s first crucial test would come in South Carolina’s primary, where black voters make up the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/21/cory-booker-bernie-sanders-2020-south-carolina-1116639\">majority</a> of the Democratic electorate. Voters there are more socially conservative than black voters in many other states, and the most efficient way to connect with them is through churches. So Booker’s first 2019 trip to an early-primary state was to South Carolina, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, for an appearance at Zion Baptist Church in the state capital, Columbia. <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> was there too, but Booker was promoted as the main attraction. “<strong>Barack Obama’s</strong> ability to break through with African-American voters in 2008 wasn’t simply around issues,” says Belcher, who worked for that campaign. “It was also around values, and what he represented. Remember the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/16/us/politics/16obama.html\">fatherhood responsibility speech</a> that he did? A lot of the chattering class elites had a bit of a problem with it. You know who didn’t have a problem with it? Those churchgoing black women in South Carolina who, every Sunday, that’s a conversation in their churches.”</p>\n<p>Obama demolished <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> in South Carolina by a 29-point margin, generating momentum that propelled him into a strong Super Tuesday showing. The context for Booker will be very different&#8212;in part because President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> looms over everything, but also because the South Carolina Democratic primary has never before included two black contenders. He would be going up against his good friend from the Senate, <strong>Kamala Harris.</strong> His strengths include the breadth of his life experience&#8212;Booker was a star student and football player who studied at Stanford and Oxford and Yale, but continually worked with low-income kids and moved to a Newark housing project before successfully running to become that city’s mayor in 2006. Booker would be the first former Democratic mayor of a major city to run for president since Cleveland’s <strong>Dennis Kucinich</strong> in 2008, providing a powerful voice for urban issues at a time when big cities are underrepresented in the national political process and discussion. Booker still lives in hardscrabble Newark, a decision his camp says was never a stunt&#8212;that it gave him a genuine understanding of working-class issues when he was mayor, and that it would distinguish him from the rest of the field if he runs for president.</p>\n<p>Booker, never married, would lack one key element that helped Obama sell himself on a human level in South Carolina: an exemplary wife and kids. His greatest weakness, though, may be the theatricality with which he expresses his experiences and opinions, a style that can produce compelling rhetoric, but one that also opens him up to skepticism that his actions are indeed stunts. In September, during the <strong>Brett Kavanaugh</strong> confirmation hearings, Booker declared, “This is about the closest I’ll probably ever have in my life to an ‘I am Spartacus’ moment,” as he <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/405345-booker-releases-confidential-kavanaugh-documents\">released</a> supposedly confidential documents. Unfortunately for Booker, the documents had already been released the night before, and did not back up Booker’s claims about Kavanaugh and racial profiling. “People may view some of the things he does as flashy, but they are effective and genuine,” the Booker ally says. “He’s a product of two parents who were active in the civil-rights movement, and he’s been seeking creative ways to elevate the causes he believes in for a long time. He also talks about love and unity of purpose in politics in a way that distinguishes him from many Democrats.” No less an authority on black churches and political performance than the Reverend <strong>Al Sharpton</strong> vouches for Booker’s abilities. “I’ve seen Cory mesmerize church audiences,” Sharpton says. “I don’t see that as a problem.”</p>\n<p>Other candidates will also be competing hard to win the support of black voters in South Carolina&#8212;<strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> stopped by for a rally on Wednesday&#8212;and demographics guarantee Booker and Harris nothing. Which doesn’t mean, of course, that they won’t try to turn that commonality into an advantage, and that they won’t inevitably fight over the same voters. Harris has been heavily emphasizing the fact that she attended the historically black Howard University, and on Friday she will speak at a charity event hosted by a chapter of her college sorority&#8212;in Columbia, South Carolina. Booker’s campaign would try to draw a contrast between his street-level empathy and Harris’s years as a prosecutor. “It would be wrong to think that just because you’re black, the African-American electorate is going to rally around you,” Belcher says. “If that were true, Barack Obama wouldn’t have been losing to Hillary Clinton by 20 or 30 points before we put in a plan. Every campaign has to find its lane. Kamala, and Booker, if he runs, are going to have to work to win over the audience of African-American voters. They are central to anyone becoming the nominee. And if you cannot come in first or second place in South Carolina, you cannot be the Democratic nominee.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The family drama surrounding <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/biden-2020-front-runner-family-divorce-drama?inline\">Joe Biden’s presidential bid</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; What to make of the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/buzzfeed-mueller-saga-veteran-journalists-circumspect-confused?inline\">BuzzFeed-Mueller mystery</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; A happy ending for one <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/fyre-festival-caterer-gofundme-maryann-rolle?inline\">Fyre Festival contractor</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Intrigue in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jesse-angelo-abruptly-exits-the-new-york-post-murdoch?inline\">Murdoch-land</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Yes, <em>Schitt’s Creek</em> really is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/yes-schitts-creek-really-is-that-good?inline\">that good</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"2020","socialTitle":"“He Seems So Hammed Up”: Cory Booker Battles an Authenticity Problem","socialDescription":"The former Newark mayor can tell a compelling story about urban issues and his own background.

On Tuesday, <strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong> did just that as he welcomed <strong>Michelle Obama</strong> back to <em>The Tonight Show</em>&#8212;to the great delight of many guests at 30 Rock. The gambit? Very simple: stand outside the elevators and wait.</p>\n<p>As the doors opened, multiple tour groups at NBC’s headquarters were treated to the surprise of a lifetime: Fallon and Michelle Obama, waiting to be glimpsed by them. One group saw the pair sitting in armchairs, casually reading one another’s books. Another saw the two playing around with a piano. Yet another saw Obama jumping rope. Regardless of what Obama was doing, the reaction was always the same: gleeful screams.</p>\n<p>This is not the first time Obama and Fallon have teamed up for a heartwarming prank. Last year, as the Obamas departed the White House, Fallon invited guests to record farewell messages for Michelle&#8212;but did not inform them that the First Lady was listening to their heartfelt words from behind a screen. The reactions were about as <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/michelle-obama-tonight-show\">emotional</a> as you’d expect. In fact, the idea was such a success that Fallon later repeated it with guests including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expKmfdoo28\"><strong>Chadwick Boseman</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/04/tina-fey-surprise-mean-girls-fans-jimmy-fallon-tonight-show\"><strong>Tina Fey</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this is the kind of late-night fare we could use more of. After all, gleeful videos of celebrity pranks and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/cardi-b-carpool-karaoke-james-corden-late-late-show\">senior-center concerts</a> make a pretty
