The legal arguments in the case are very similar to the one that <a href=\"https:\/\/talkingpointsmemo.com\/dc\/breaking-federal-court-strikes-down-kentuckys-medicaid-work-requirement\">successfully struck down<\/a> Kentucky's Medicaid work requirement in June, essentially saying that Trump's HHS violated both the Medicaid statute and the Constitution in approving the rules without taking into account the harm they could cause. In Arkansas, the only state so far to actually implement a work requirement, that harm is imminent. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/paulmcleod\/thousands-of-people-in-arkansas-are-on-the-brink-of-losing\">Thousands of people<\/a> could lose their insurance this summer after failing to navigate the new online-only system for filing their work hours.\r\n\r\nBut these lawsuits are not stopping or slowing down the Trump administration's crusade for Medicaid restrictions. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/story\/2018\/08\/16\/medicaid-changes-trump-work-drug-use-741890\">Politico reports<\/a> that HHS is on the brink of approving work requirements in at least three more states \u2014\u00a0Arizona, Wisconsin and Maine \u2014 and is prepared to allow Wisconsin, for the first time, to ask Medicaid beneficiaries if they use drugs or are in recovery. Gov. Scott Walker (R)\u00a0originally wanted to go further, and asked HHS for permission to implement <a href=\"https:\/\/talkingpointsmemo.com\/dc\/trump-admins-decision-looms-on-wisconsins-bid-for-medicaid-drug-tests\">mandatory tests<\/a> for any Medicaid applicant who flagged a history of drug use and deny coverage to those who refused the test or refused to enter treatment if they tested positive. Legal experts <a href=\"https:\/\/talkingpointsmemo.com\/dc\/trump-admins-decision-looms-on-wisconsins-bid-for-medicaid-drug-tests\">told TPM<\/a> this would be blatantly unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nYet the Trump administration is also taking some steps to shore up the ACA.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonexaminer.com\/policy\/healthcare\/trump-administration-approves-new-jersey-plan-to-shore-up-obamacare\">HHS approved New Jersey's<\/a> plan to implement a statewide individual mandate and reinsurance program to help stabilize the ACA market and bring down insurance premiums \u2014 steps intended to repair the damage done by Congress' repeal of the national individual mandate and the Trump administration's repeated blows to the ACA. HHS also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cms.gov\/CCIIO\/Programs-and-Initiatives\/Health-Insurance-Market-Reforms\/Downloads\/state-flexibility-grant-fact-sheet.pdf\">announced a grant<\/a> of $8.6 million to help states strengthen their ACA markets.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, health care is set to play a major role in this November's midterm elections. Across the country, vulnerable red and purple state Democrats are campaigning on protecting people with preexisting conditions, and are attacking their Republican challengers for supporting a lawsuit that would gut the ACA's coverage guarantee.\r\n\r\nSens.
