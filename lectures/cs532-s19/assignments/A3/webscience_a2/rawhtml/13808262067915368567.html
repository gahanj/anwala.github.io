For six months, undocumented Polish laborers had been clearing the future site of Trump Tower, his signature real estate project on Manhattan&#8217;s Fifth Avenue, where he now lives, maintains his private offices and hosts his presidential campaign. The men were putting in 12-hour shifts with inadequate safety equipment at subpar wages that their contractor paid sporadically, if at all. A lawyer for many of the Poles demanded that the workers be paid or else he would serve Trump with a lien on the property. One Polish worker even went to Trump&#8217;s office to ask him for money in person, according to sworn testimony and a deposition filed under oath in a court case. For help, Trump turned to Daniel Sullivan, a 6-ft. 5-in., 285-lb. labor consultant, FBI informant and future officer of the Teamsters Union. &#8220;Donald told me he had difficulties &#8230;,&#8221; Sullivan later testified in the case. &#8220;That he had some illegal Polish employees on the job.&#8221; Sullivan had been helping Trump negotiate a casino deal in New Jersey at the time, and he testified that he was shocked by Trump&#8217;s admission. &#8220;I think you are nuts,&#8221; Sullivan testified that he told Trump. &#8220;You are here negotiating a lease in Atlantic City for a casino license and you are telling me you have got illegal employees on the job.&#8221; For 36 years, Trump has denied knowingly using undocumented workers to demolish the building that would be replaced with Trump Tower in 1980. After Senator Marco Rubio raised the issue of undocumented Polish workers during a Republican primary debate this year, Trump described himself as removed from the problem. &#8220;I hire a contractor. The contractor then hires the subcontractor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They have people. I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t remember, that was so many years ago, 35 years ago.&#8221; But thousands of pages of documents from the case, including reams of testimony and sworn depositions reviewed by TIME, tell a different story. Kept for more than a decade in 13 boxes in a federal judiciary storage unit in Missouri, the documents contain testimony that Trump sought out the Polish workers when he saw them on another job, instigated the creation of the company that paid them and negotiated the hours they would work. The papers contain testimony that Trump repeatedly toured the site where the men were working, directly addressed them about pay problems and even promised to pay them himself, which he eventually did. The documents show that after things got ugly over unpaid wages, Trump sought Sullivan&#8217;s advice on the workers and their immigration status. At one point, a lawyer for the Poles testified, Trump threatened, through his own lawyer, to call the Immigration and Naturalization Service and have the workers deported. And when the Labor Department launched a probe of the Polish laborers, Trump again called Sullivan for help, asking him to meet the federal investigator at Trump&#8217;s office, according to the documents. Testifying at a 1990 trial where he faced a charge of participation in a breach of fiduciary duty, Trump told a federal judge he &#8220;still didn&#8217;t know&#8221; if the workers were undocumented, arguing that he had hired a subcontractor who employed them and that he personally &#8220;wasn&#8217;t very involved in that whole process.&#8221; His lawyers also questioned the credibility of Sullivan, who had been convicted of tax evasion in a separate case. When contacted Aug. 23 by TIME for comment on the documents, Trump replied with an emailed statement. &#8220;The laws were totally different thirty five years ago,&#8221; he wrote in the message. &#8220;The building, Trump Tower, turned out to be one of the most successful and iconic buildings ever built. Do you have nothing better to write about than a story that is 35 years old and filled with half truths and false information?&#8221; Later that day, as part of a political pivot designed to soften his image with minority and centrist voters, Trump told an interviewer he might reconsider the hard-line stance against undocumented immigrants that has been a centerpiece of his campaign. Since shortly after launching his bid for the presidency, he has promised to rid the nation of its 11 million undocumented workers, possibly by employing a &#8220;deportation force,&#8221; and to suspend issuing new green cards in order to force employers to hire from the citizen labor pool. He has regularly described undocumented workers as an economic threat to U.S. citizens. &#8220;They&#8217;re taking our manufacturing jobs,&#8221; he said at a rally in Phoenix in July 2015. &#8220;They&#8217;re taking our money. They&#8217;re killing us.&#8221; Thirty-six years ago, at the beginning of his career, he saw things differently. Trump Tower has never been just another building project for Donald Trump. And in 1980, it was something of a personal obsession. He had started in real estate in Queens, working for his father, who had prospered in the outer boroughs. In 1979 he managed, through charm, persistence and hard work, to secure the lease on the old Bonwit Teller building at 56th Street and Fifth Avenue, eventually signing a 50-50 deal with the property owner to develop what would be the city&#8217;s tallest glass structure on the site. Facing zoning restrictions, Trump made large donations to politicians and curried favor with powerful members of the New York board of estimate, which approved a zoning variance for the project. With the approvals in hand, Trump set about preparing to build. One day in late 1979, he was inspecting renovation work being undertaken by a tenant in a building he owned next door to the site, and saw the Poles at work, according to testimony given to the court by the foreman overseeing the job. The foreman testified that Trump personally approached him to ask who they were. &#8220;Those Polish guys are good, hard workers,&#8221; court documents say the foreman recalled Trump saying. Soon afterward, Trump met with the workers&#8217; boss, a man named William Kaszycki, at Trump&#8217;s lavish office across Fifth Avenue, Kaszycki later testified. Kaszycki&#8217;s company specialized in window and job-site cleaning and had never done the heavy demolition work required to remove a 12-story building in midtown Manhattan. Kaszycki testified that Trump told him to start a new company to do the demolition work and directed him to get new and different insurance for the job. Kaszycki, who has since died, testified that he accepted Trump&#8217;s $775,000 fee offer flat out. And with Trump offering an additional $25,000 if the building came down quickly, Kaszycki promised him that the Poles would work day and night, seven days a week. And they did. From January to March 1980, they sneaked over from the job next door and worked two shifts, one from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., the other from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Some later testified that they worked 24-hour shifts. They were paid $4 to $5 an hour, court documents show, which at the time was less than half the prevailing union wage and just above the state minimum wage of $3.10 an hour. Tearing down walls, cutting pipes and pulling electrical wires is dangerous work, and unlike union workers who later joined the job, most of the Polish workers lacked safety equipment like hard hats, according to the testimony of several former workers. A large piece of steel fell on the arm of one worker, Albin Lipinski, breaking several bones and permanently disfiguring his fingers. But it was a dispute about money, not safety and long hours, that would later cause Trump so much trouble. Five miles east of the Fifth Avenue job site, at a two-story tin-sided house in the heavily Polish neighborhood of Maspeth, Queens, a middle-aged lawyer named John Szabo started getting visits in March 1980 from undocumented Polish laborers who said they were not being paid for their work. Before long, he would have dozens of clients from the same job. Szabo contacted Kaszycki, who was spending much of his time in Florida, but couldn&#8217;t reach him. So in late March, Szabo called Thomas Macari, a vice president in Trump&#8217;s operation, according to Szabo&#8217;s testimony. Macari, who could not be reached for comment, was overseeing the demolition job on a daily basis, according to the testimony of the Poles, Kaszycki and others in the case. If his clients weren&#8217;t paid, Szabo said, he would serve Trump with a mechanic&#8217;s lien, a powerful legal device that gives a laborer partial claim to the title of a property on which he has worked. Soon Trump, who toured the site on multiple occasions, according to the testimony of witnesses, had to address the issue himself. One evening in the spring of 1980, he met with some of the workers at the Bonwit Teller building, according to the testimony of one of the Poles on the job, Joseph Dabrowski. Kaszycki hadn&#8217;t been showing up on the job, and the Poles were angry about not being paid. Trump told them that if Kaszycki left the job for good, he would pay them himself, Dabrowski testified. And initially he made good on that promise. Trump used a bank account that required his signature to pay Kaszycki&#8217;s creditors, and Macari opened a new account requiring his own signature to pay the demolition workers. Macari paid the Polish workers cash for Trump, according to the sworn testimony of multiple witnesses. But still the Polish workers were paid inconsistently. Lipinski, who had become a foreman after his arm was crushed by the steel beam, took matters into his own hands. Around noon one afternoon, he walked across Fifth Avenue and into Trump&#8217;s office, Lipinski testified. &#8220;He spoke to the secretary and was surprised the secretary let him speak to Trump,&#8221; Lipinski&#8217;s son Jozef says in an interview this summer, sitting next to his father in his apartment in New York. Jozef says his father told him and his brother the story throughout their childhood: &#8220;Trump told him, &#8216;I paid the checks and anything I owed to the other guy, and he&#8217;s supposed to pay you.'&#8221; Now 80, Albin Lipinski is a U.S. citizen. Speaking through an interpreter at his home, he displayed his hand, still scarred from the accident, but says he supports Trump for President. Twenty-seven years after signing an affidavit about his meeting with Trump and testifying under oath about it, he now says he did go to Trump&#8217;s office but never met Trump. &#8220;I went to the office because I was mad I wasn&#8217;t being paid,&#8221; he says through a translator, but &#8220;I never met Trump.&#8221; Jozef and his brother say their father has begun forgetting things in his old age. By early June 1980, the Polish workers&#8217; unpaid wages totaled over $100,000. It was at this point, Sullivan later testified, that Trump asked the labor consultant for advice about the laborers. &#8220;I told him to fire them promptly if he had any brains,&#8221; Sullivan testified. Sullivan died in 1993. Trump initially ignored the advice. On June 27, 1980, the Poles&#8217; lawyer, Szabo, went to Trump&#8217;s office and served Trump with a mechanic&#8217;s lien, Szabo testified. Worse, the Polish workers were threatening violence, according to Sullivan&#8217;s testimony. &#8220;Donald called me at my home in Pennsylvania on June 27th, 1980, and asked could he see me immediately,&#8221; Sullivan testified. &#8220;He needed some help because the employees on the Bonwit Teller were threatening to hang a fellow named Tom Macari off the building and would I come to New York as soon as possible.&#8221; At his office on Fifth Avenue the next day, Trump told Sullivan he was in a bind: if he didn&#8217;t have the Bonwit building down by Sept. 1, he said, he was going to have to pay real estate taxes on it, Sullivan testified. Sullivan persuaded Trump to fire the Poles and rely only on union workers to get the building down. Worried the Poles would never get paid, Szabo put a second and third lien on the property. On Aug. 8, he called Macari and told him that because Trump had been paying the Poles, he was legally their employer. That meant that under the Fair Labor Standards Act, Trump couldn&#8217;t sell any space in the tower until Szabo&#8217;s clients were paid. Forty-five minutes later, Szabo testified, he received a call from a man who identified himself as a Mr. Barron from Trump&#8217;s legal department, who said Trump was going to sue Szabo for $100 million for wrongful filing of mechanic&#8217;s liens. At trial, Trump admitted that both he and a senior executive at the company had used the name Barron as a pseudonym. &#8220;I believe I occasionally used that name,&#8221; said Trump. But in this case, Macari said under oath that it had been he who called Szabo while posing as Barron; Szabo testified he didn&#8217;t recognize &#8220;Barron&#8217;s&#8221; voice. Szabo wrote a long letter defending his actions and laying out his case under the law and sent it to &#8220;Barron&#8221; on Aug. 18. A few days later, Szabo testified, he received a call from a real lawyer for Trump, Irwin Durben, who said Trump was threatening to ask the Immigration and Naturalization Service to have the Poles deported. By the fall, the Labor Department was investigating Trump and Kaszycki&#8217;s use of the undocumented workers. That winter, a Labor Department official made an appointment to inspect Trump&#8217;s employment records at the office across from the work site. Trump called Sullivan and asked him to attend the meeting with the federal investigator, according to Sullivan&#8217;s testimony. In the end, Szabo and the Labor Department won a judgment of $254,523.59 against Kaszycki. Trump never had to pay the Poles another cent. None of this history would have been preserved at the federal court storage facility near Kansas City, Mo., but for a separate fight over money and Trump&#8217;s use of the Polish workers. According to the contract Kaszycki had signed with Local 95 of the House Wreckers Union, he and Trump were supposed to pay into the union&#8217;s pension and welfare fund a percentage of every man-hour worked on the project, whether it was done by union or nonunion workers. A dissident member of Local 95, a former boxer named Harry Diduck, who has since died, realized Trump and Kaszycki had been paying the pension fund only for the hours the few dozen union workers had put in, not for the hours the Poles had worked. In 1983, Diduck and his lawyers, Burton Hall and Wendy Sloan, sued Kaszycki, the union president and subsequently Trump and others for the $600,000 they claimed Trump and his partners owed the pension fund. Over time, Sloan amassed thousands of pages of testimony from the Polish workers, Sullivan, Szabo, Macari and dozens of others. Trump fought her at every step. When she tried to depose him, he stormed out after two hours complaining that he was being harassed, necessitating a court order forcing another deposition. The case ran for 15 years. The initial judge in the matter found that Trump had participated in defrauding the union pension fund. It then went through an appeal and multiple battles back at the district court under three different judges. Finally, in 1998, when the question of whether Trump was the legal employer of the Poles was set to go to a jury trial, Trump settled. No one knows how much he ended up paying to compensate the union pension fund. The deal remains sealed by the court. TIME and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press have asked the court to make the deal public. But the other records in the case have been sitting in storage ever since. They include a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York City that gave both sides partial victories. It began with a swipe at the union president and the later complicity of Trump&#8217;s organization: &#8220;This case illustrates an immutable law with respect to falsehoods&#8211;as immutable as the one respecting gravity Sir Isaac Newton conceived upon seeing an apple fall from a tree: having first manufactured a falsehood, a person is forced to invent more to maintain it; yet, as here, in the end, time generally reveals what a falsehood hopes to hide.&#8221; Sullivan put it more bluntly in 1990 to People magazine. &#8220;It was disgusting how he used people,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;I said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t exploit them like that. Don&#8217;t try to f-ck these poor souls over.&#8217; It baffled me then, and it makes me sick even now that he knowingly had these Poles there for the purpose of Trump Tower at starvation wages. He couldn&#8217;t give a sh-t because he&#8217;s Donald Trump and everybody is here to serve him. Over time he became more and more monstrous and arrogant. I asked myself, &#8216;How long is it going to take for all of this to catch up with him?'&#8221; &#8211;With reporting by MERRILL FABRY and CELINE WOJTALA/NEW YORK and MELISSA AUGUST/WASHINGTON This

Kaszycki, who has since died, testified that he accepted Trump&#x27;s $775,000 fee offer flat out. And with Trump offering an additional $25,000 if the building came down quickly, Kaszycki promised him that the Poles would work day and night, seven days a week.<!-- /react-text --></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid="343"><!-- react-text: 344 -->And they did.

They were paid $4 to $5 an hour, court documents show, which at the time was less than half the prevailing union wage and just above the state minimum wage of $3.10 an hour. Tearing down walls, cutting pipes and pulling electrical wires is dangerous work, and unlike union workers who later joined the job, most of the Polish workers lacked safety equipment like hard hats, according to the testimony of several former workers. A large piece of steel fell on the arm of one worker, Albin Lipinski, breaking several bones and permanently disfiguring his fingers.<!-- /react-text --></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid="345"><!-- react-text: 346 -->But it was a dispute about money, not safety and long hours, that would later cause Trump so much trouble. Five miles east of the Fifth Avenue job site, at a two-story tin-sided house in the heavily Polish neighborhood of Maspeth, Queens, a middle-aged lawyer named John Szabo started getting visits in March 1980 from undocumented Polish laborers who said they were not being paid for their work. Before long, he would have dozens of clients from the same job. Szabo contacted Kaszycki, who was spending much of his time in Florida, but couldn&#x27;t reach him. So in late March, Szabo called Thomas Macari, a vice president in Trump&#x27;s operation, according to Szabo&#x27;s testimony. Macari, who could not be reached for comment, was overseeing the demolition job on a daily basis, according to the testimony of the Poles, Kaszycki and others in the case. If his clients weren&#x27;t paid, Szabo said, he would serve Trump with a mechanic&#x27;s lien, a powerful legal device that gives a laborer partial claim to the title of a property on which he has worked.<!-- /react-text --></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid="347"><!-- react-text: 348 -->Soon Trump, who toured the site on multiple occasions, according to the testimony of witnesses, had to address the issue himself.

Kaszycki hadn&#x27;t been showing up on the job, and the Poles were angry about not being paid. Trump told them that if Kaszycki left the job for good, he would pay them himself, Dabrowski testified. And initially he made good on that promise. Trump used a bank account that required his signature to pay Kaszycki&#x27;s creditors, and Macari opened a new account requiring his own signature to pay the demolition workers. Macari paid the Polish workers cash for Trump, according to the sworn testimony of multiple witnesses.<!-- /react-text --></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid="349"><!-- react-text: 350 -->But still the Polish workers were paid inconsistently.

A lawyer for many of the Poles demanded that the workers be paid or else he would serve Trump with a lien on the property. One Polish worker even went to Trump&#8217;s office to ask him for money in person, according to sworn testimony and a deposition filed under oath in a court case.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor help, Trump turned to Daniel Sullivan, a 6-ft. 5-in., 285-lb. labor consultant, FBI informant and future officer of the Teamsters Union. &#8220;Donald told me he had difficulties &#8230;,&#8221; Sullivan later testified in the case. &#8220;That he had some illegal Polish employees on the job.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"video-container\"\u003E\u003Cvideo id=\"brightcove-player-5078671227001\" data-video-id=\"5078671227001\" data-account=\"293884104\" data-player=\"SJa0Thl7\" data-embed=\"default\" controls preload=\"auto\" class=\"video-js responsive-video\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fvideo\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESullivan had been helping Trump negotiate a casino deal in New Jersey at the time, and he testified that he was shocked by Trump&#8217;s admission. &#8220;I think you are nuts,&#8221; Sullivan testified that he told Trump. &#8220;You are here negotiating a lease in Atlantic City for a casino license and you are telling me you have got illegal employees on the job.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor 36 years, Trump has denied knowingly using undocumented workers to demolish the building that would be replaced with Trump Tower in 1980. After Senator Marco Rubio raised the issue of undocumented Polish workers during a Republican primary debate this year, Trump described himself as removed from the problem. &#8220;I hire a contractor. The contractor then hires the subcontractor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They have people. I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t remember, that was so many years ago, 35 years ago.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut thousands of pages of documents from the case, including reams of testimony and sworn depositions reviewed by TIME, tell a different story. Kept for more than a decade in 13 boxes in a federal judiciary storage unit in Missouri, the documents contain testimony that Trump sought out the Polish workers when he saw them on another job, instigated the creation of the company that paid them and negotiated the hours they would work.

At one point, a lawyer for the Poles testified, Trump threatened, through his own lawyer, to call the Immigration and Naturalization Service and have the workers deported.

When contacted Aug. 23 by TIME for comment on the documents, Trump replied with an emailed statement. &#8220;The laws were totally different thirty five years ago,&#8221; he wrote in the message. &#8220;The building, Trump Tower, turned out to be one of the most successful and iconic buildings ever built. Do you have nothing better to write about than a story that is 35 years old and filled with half truths and false information?&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELater that day, as part of a political pivot designed to soften his image with minority and centrist voters, Trump told an interviewer he might reconsider the hard-line stance against undocumented immigrants that has been a centerpiece of his campaign. Since shortly after launching his bid for the presidency, he has promised to rid the nation of its 11 million undocumented workers, possibly by employing a &#8220;deportation force,&#8221; and to suspend issuing new green cards in order to force employers to hire from the citizen labor pool. He has regularly described undocumented workers as an economic threat to U.S. citizens. &#8220;They&#8217;re taking our manufacturing jobs,&#8221; he said at a rally in Phoenix in July 2015. &#8220;They&#8217;re taking our money. They&#8217;re killing us.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThirty-six years ago, at the beginning of his career, he saw things differently.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETrump Tower has never been just another building project for Donald Trump. And in 1980, it was something of a personal obsession. He had started in real estate in Queens, working for his father, who had prospered in the outer boroughs. In 1979 he managed, through charm, persistence and hard work, to secure the lease on the old Bonwit Teller building at 56th Street and Fifth Avenue, eventually signing a 50-50 deal with the property owner to develop what would be the city&#8217;s tallest glass structure on the site. Facing zoning restrictions, Trump made large donations to politicians and curried favor with powerful members of the New York board of estimate, which approved a zoning variance for the project.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the approvals in hand, Trump set about preparing to build. One day in late 1979, he was inspecting renovation work being undertaken by a tenant in a building he owned next door to the site, and saw the Poles at work, according to testimony given to the court by the foreman overseeing the job. The foreman testified that Trump personally approached him to ask who they were. &#8220;Those Polish guys are good, hard workers,&#8221; court documents say the foreman recalled Trump saying. Soon afterward, Trump met with the workers&#8217; boss, a man named William Kaszycki, at Trump&#8217;s lavish office across Fifth Avenue, Kaszycki later testified.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKaszycki&#8217;s company specialized in window and job-site cleaning and had never done the heavy demolition work required to remove a 12-story building in midtown Manhattan. Kaszycki testified that Trump told him to start a new company to do the demolition work and directed him to get new and different insurance for the job. Kaszycki, who has since died, testified that he accepted Trump&#8217;s $775,000 fee offer flat out. And with Trump offering an additional $25,000 if the building came down quickly, Kaszycki promised him that the Poles would work day and night, seven days a week.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd they did. From January to March 1980, they sneaked over from the job next door and worked two shifts, one from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., the other from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Some later testified that they worked 24-hour shifts. They were paid $4 to $5 an hour, court documents show, which at the time was less than half the prevailing union wage and just above the state minimum wage of $3.10 an hour. Tearing down walls, cutting pipes and pulling electrical wires is dangerous work, and unlike union workers who later joined the job, most of the Polish workers lacked safety equipment like hard hats, according to the testimony of several former workers. A large piece of steel fell on the arm of one worker, Albin Lipinski, breaking several bones and permanently disfiguring his fingers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut it was a dispute about money, not safety and long hours, that would later cause Trump so much trouble. Five miles east of the Fifth Avenue job site, at a two-story tin-sided house in the heavily Polish neighborhood of Maspeth, Queens, a middle-aged lawyer named John Szabo started getting visits in March 1980 from undocumented Polish laborers who said they were not being paid for their work. Before long, he would have dozens of clients from the same job. Szabo contacted Kaszycki, who was spending much of his time in Florida, but couldn&#8217;t reach him. So in late March, Szabo called Thomas Macari, a vice president in Trump&#8217;s operation, according to Szabo&#8217;s testimony. Macari, who could not be reached for comment, was overseeing the demolition job on a daily basis, according to the testimony of the Poles, Kaszycki and others in the case. If his clients weren&#8217;t paid, Szabo said, he would serve Trump with a mechanic&#8217;s lien, a powerful legal device that gives a laborer partial claim to the title of a property on which he has worked.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESoon Trump, who toured the site on multiple occasions, according to the testimony of witnesses, had to address the issue himself. One evening in the spring of 1980, he met with some of the workers at the Bonwit Teller building, according to the testimony of one of the Poles on the job, Joseph Dabrowski. Kaszycki hadn&#8217;t been showing up on the job, and the Poles were angry about not being paid. Trump told them that if Kaszycki left the job for good, he would pay them himself, Dabrowski testified. And initially he made good on that promise. Trump used a bank account that required his signature to pay Kaszycki&#8217;s creditors, and Macari opened a new account requiring his own signature to pay the demolition workers. Macari paid the Polish workers cash for Trump, according to the sworn testimony of multiple witnesses.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut still the Polish workers were paid inconsistently. Lipinski, who had become a foreman after his arm was crushed by the steel beam, took matters into his own hands. Around noon one afternoon, he walked across Fifth Avenue and into Trump&#8217;s office, Lipinski testified. &#8220;He spoke to the secretary and was surprised the secretary let him speak to Trump,&#8221; Lipinski&#8217;s son Jozef says in an interview this summer, sitting next to his father in his apartment in New York. Jozef says his father told him and his brother the story throughout their childhood: &#8220;Trump told him, &#8216;I paid the checks and anything I owed to the other guy, and he&#8217;s supposed to pay you.'&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow 80, Albin Lipinski is a U.S. citizen. Speaking through an interpreter at his home, he displayed his hand, still scarred from the accident, but says he supports Trump for President. Twenty-seven years after signing an affidavit about his meeting with Trump and testifying under oath about it, he now says he did go to Trump&#8217;s office but never met Trump. &#8220;I went to the office because I was mad I wasn&#8217;t being paid,&#8221; he says through a translator, but &#8220;I never met Trump.&#8221; Jozef and his brother say their father has begun forgetting things in his old age.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy early June 1980, the Polish workers&#8217; unpaid wages totaled over $100,000. It was at this point, Sullivan later testified, that Trump asked the labor consultant for advice about the laborers. &#8220;I told him to fire them promptly if he had any brains,&#8221; Sullivan testified. Sullivan died in 1993.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETrump initially ignored the advice. On June 27, 1980, the Poles&#8217; lawyer, Szabo, went to Trump&#8217;s office and served Trump with a mechanic&#8217;s lien, Szabo testified. Worse, the Polish workers were threatening violence, according to Sullivan&#8217;s testimony. &#8220;Donald called me at my home in Pennsylvania on June 27th, 1980, and asked could he see me immediately,&#8221; Sullivan testified. &#8220;He needed some help because the employees on the Bonwit Teller were threatening to hang a fellow named Tom Macari off the building and would I come to New York as soon as possible.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt his office on Fifth Avenue the next day, Trump told Sullivan he was in a bind: if he didn&#8217;t have the Bonwit building down by Sept. 1, he said, he was going to have to pay real estate taxes on it, Sullivan testified. Sullivan persuaded Trump to fire the Poles and rely only on union workers to get the building down.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWorried the Poles would never get paid, Szabo put a second and third lien on the property. On Aug. 8, he called Macari and told him that because Trump had been paying the Poles, he was legally their employer. That meant that under the Fair Labor Standards Act, Trump couldn&#8217;t sell any space in the tower until Szabo&#8217;s clients were paid.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EForty-five minutes later, Szabo testified, he received a call from a man who identified himself as a Mr. Barron from Trump&#8217;s legal department, who said Trump was going to sue Szabo for $100 million for wrongful filing of mechanic&#8217;s liens. At trial, Trump admitted that both he and a senior executive at the company had used the name Barron as a pseudonym. &#8220;I believe I occasionally used that name,&#8221; said Trump. But in this case, Macari said under oath that it had been he who called Szabo while posing as Barron; Szabo testified he didn&#8217;t recognize &#8220;Barron&#8217;s&#8221; voice.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESzabo wrote a long letter defending his actions and laying out his case under the law and sent it to &#8220;Barron&#8221; on Aug. 18. A few days later, Szabo testified, he received a call from a real lawyer for Trump, Irwin Durben, who said Trump was threatening to ask the Immigration and Naturalization Service to have the Poles deported.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy the fall, the Labor Department was investigating Trump and Kaszycki&#8217;s use of the undocumented workers. That winter, a Labor Department official made an appointment to inspect Trump&#8217;s employment records at the office across from the work site. Trump called Sullivan and asked him to attend the meeting with the federal investigator, according to Sullivan&#8217;s testimony. In the end, Szabo and the Labor Department won a judgment of $254,523.59 against Kaszycki. Trump never had to pay the Poles another cent.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENone of this history would have been preserved at the federal court storage facility near Kansas City, Mo., but for a separate fight over money and Trump&#8217;s use of the Polish workers. According to the contract Kaszycki had signed with Local 95 of the House Wreckers Union, he and Trump were supposed to pay into the union&#8217;s pension and welfare fund a percentage of every man-hour worked on the project, whether it was done by union or nonunion workers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA dissident member of Local 95, a former boxer named Harry Diduck, who has since died, realized Trump and Kaszycki had been paying the pension fund only for the hours the few dozen union workers had put in, not for the hours the Poles had worked. In 1983, Diduck and his lawyers, Burton Hall and Wendy Sloan, sued Kaszycki, the union president and subsequently Trump and others for the $600,000 they claimed Trump and his partners owed the pension fund.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOver time, Sloan amassed thousands of pages of testimony from the Polish workers, Sullivan, Szabo, Macari and dozens of others. Trump fought her at every step. When she tried to depose him, he stormed out after two hours complaining that he was being harassed, necessitating a court order forcing another deposition. The case ran for 15 years. The initial judge in the matter found that Trump had participated in defrauding the union pension fund. It then went through an appeal and multiple battles back at the district court under three different judges. Finally, in 1998, when the question of whether Trump was the legal employer of the Poles was set to go to a jury trial, Trump settled. No one knows how much he ended up paying to compensate the union pension fund. The deal remains sealed by the court. TIME and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press have asked the court to make the deal public.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the other records in the case have been sitting in storage ever since. They include a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York City that gave both sides partial victories. It began with a swipe at the union president and the later complicity of Trump&#8217;s organization: &#8220;This case illustrates an immutable law with respect to falsehoods&#8211;as immutable as the one respecting gravity Sir Isaac Newton conceived upon seeing an apple fall from a tree: having first manufactured a falsehood, a person is forced to invent more to maintain it; yet, as here, in the end, time generally reveals what a falsehood hopes to hide.&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESullivan put it more bluntly in 1990 to People magazine. &#8220;It was disgusting how he used people,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;I said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t exploit them like that. Don&#8217;t try to f-ck these poor souls over.&#8217; It baffled me then, and it makes me sick even now that he knowingly had these Poles there for the purpose of Trump Tower at starvation wages. He couldn&#8217;t give a sh-t because he&#8217;s Donald Trump and everybody is here to serve him. Over time he became more and more monstrous and arrogant. I asked myself, &#8216;How long is it going to take for all of this to catch up with him?'&#8221;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8211;With reporting by MERRILL FABRY and CELINE WOJTALA\u002FNEW YORK and MELISSA AUGUST\u002FWASHINGTON\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis appears in the September 05, 2016 issue of TIME.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E","protected":false,"structured":[{"tag":"p","attributes":[],"content":["In the summer of 1980, ",{"tag":"a","attributes":{"href":"http:\u002F\u002Ftime.com\u002F4465745\u002Fthe-first-task-for-donald-trumps-new-campaign-chief-manage-the-candidate\u002F"},"content":["Donald Trump"]}," faced a big problem.

For six months, undocumented Polish laborers had been clearing the future site of Trump Tower, his signature real estate project on Manhattan&#8217;s Fifth Avenue, where he now lives, maintains his private offices and hosts his presidential campaign. The men were putting in 12-hour shifts with inadequate safety equipment at subpar wages that their contractor paid sporadically, if at all. A lawyer for many of the Poles demanded that the workers be paid or else he would serve Trump with a lien on the property. One Polish worker even went to Trump&#8217;s office to ask him for money in person, according to sworn testimony and a deposition filed under oath in a court case. For help, Trump turned to Daniel Sullivan, a 6-ft. 5-in., 285-lb. labor consultant, FBI informant and future officer of the Teamsters Union. &#8220;Donald told me he had difficulties &#8230;,&#8221; Sullivan later testified in the case. &#8220;That he had some illegal Polish employees on the job.&#8221; Sullivan had been helping Trump negotiate a casino deal in New Jersey at the time, and he testified that he was shocked by Trump&#8217;s admission. &#8220;I think you are nuts,&#8221; Sullivan testified that he told Trump. &#8220;You are here negotiating a lease in Atlantic City for a casino license and you are telling me you have got illegal employees on the job.&#8221; For 36 years, Trump has denied knowingly using undocumented workers to demolish the building that would be replaced with Trump Tower in 1980. After Senator Marco Rubio raised the issue of undocumented Polish workers during a Republican primary debate this year, Trump described himself as removed from the problem. &#8220;I hire a contractor. The contractor then hires the subcontractor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They have people. I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t remember, that was so many years ago, 35 years ago.&#8221; But thousands of pages of documents from the case, including reams of testimony and sworn depositions reviewed by TIME, tell a different story. Kept for more than a decade in 13 boxes in a federal judiciary storage unit in Missouri, the documents contain testimony that Trump sought out the Polish workers when he saw them on another job, instigated the creation of the company that paid them and negotiated the hours they would work. The papers contain testimony that Trump repeatedly toured the site where the men were working, directly addressed them about pay problems and even promised to pay them himself, which he eventually did. The documents show that after things got ugly over unpaid wages, Trump sought Sullivan&#8217;s advice on the workers and their immigration status. At one point, a lawyer for the Poles testified, Trump threatened, through his own lawyer, to call the Immigration and Naturalization Service and have the workers deported. And when the Labor Department launched a probe of the Polish laborers, Trump again called Sullivan for help, asking him to meet the federal investigator at Trump&#8217;s office, according to the documents. Testifying at a 1990 trial where he faced a charge of participation in a breach of fiduciary duty, Trump told a federal judge he &#8220;still didn&#8217;t know&#8221; if the workers were undocumented, arguing that he had hired a subcontractor who employed them and that he personally &#8220;wasn&#8217;t very involved in that whole process.&#8221; His lawyers also questioned the credibility of Sullivan, who had been convicted of tax evasion in a separate case. When contacted Aug. 23 by TIME for comment on the documents, Trump replied with an emailed statement. &#8220;The laws were totally different thirty five years ago,&#8221; he wrote in the message. &#8220;The building, Trump Tower, turned out to be one of the most successful and iconic buildings ever built. Do you have nothing better to write about than a story that is 35 years old and filled with half truths and false information?&#8221; Later that day, as part of a political pivot designed to soften his image with minority and centrist voters, Trump told an interviewer he might reconsider the hard-line stance against undocumented immigrants that has been a centerpiece of his campaign. Since shortly after launching his bid for the presidency, he has promised to rid the nation of its 11 million undocumented workers, possibly by employing a &#8220;deportation force,&#8221; and to suspend issuing new green cards in order to force employers to hire from the citizen labor pool. He has regularly described undocumented workers as an economic threat to U.S. citizens. &#8220;They&#8217;re taking our manufacturing jobs,&#8221; he said at a rally in Phoenix in July 2015. &#8220;They&#8217;re taking our money. They&#8217;re killing us.&#8221; Thirty-six years ago, at the beginning of his career, he saw things differently. Trump Tower has never been just another building project for Donald Trump. And in 1980, it was something of a personal obsession. He had started in real estate in Queens, working for his father, who had prospered in the outer boroughs. In 1979 he managed, through charm, persistence and hard work, to secure the lease on the old Bonwit Teller building at 56th Street and Fifth Avenue, eventually signing a 50-50 deal with the property owner to develop what would be the city&#8217;s tallest glass structure on the site. Facing zoning restrictions, Trump made large donations to politicians and curried favor with powerful members of the New York board of estimate, which approved a zoning variance for the project. With the approvals in hand, Trump set about preparing to build. One day in late 1979, he was inspecting renovation work being undertaken by a tenant in a building he owned next door to the site, and saw the Poles at work, according to testimony given to the court by the foreman overseeing the job. The foreman testified that Trump personally approached him to ask who they were. &#8220;Those Polish guys are good, hard workers,&#8221; court documents say the foreman recalled Trump saying. Soon afterward, Trump met with the workers&#8217; boss, a man named William Kaszycki, at Trump&#8217;s lavish office across Fifth Avenue, Kaszycki later testified. Kaszycki&#8217;s company specialized in window and job-site cleaning and had never done the heavy demolition work required to remove a 12-story building in midtown Manhattan. Kaszycki testified that Trump told him to start a new company to do the demolition work and directed him to get new and different insurance for the job. Kaszycki, who has since died, testified that he accepted Trump&#8217;s $775,000 fee offer flat out. And with Trump offering an additional $25,000 if the building came down quickly, Kaszycki promised him that the Poles would work day and night, seven days a week. And they did. From January to March 1980, they sneaked over from the job next door and worked two shifts, one from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., the other from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Some later testified that they worked 24-hour shifts. They were paid $4 to $5 an hour, court documents show, which at the time was less than half the prevailing union wage and just above the state minimum wage of $3.10 an hour. Tearing down walls, cutting pipes and pulling electrical wires is dangerous work, and unlike union workers who later joined the job, most of the Polish workers lacked safety equipment like hard hats, according to the testimony of several former workers. A large piece of steel fell on the arm of one worker, Albin Lipinski, breaking several bones and permanently disfiguring his fingers. But it was a dispute about money, not safety and long hours, that would later cause Trump so much trouble. Five miles east of the Fifth Avenue job site, at a two-story tin-sided house in the heavily Polish neighborhood of Maspeth, Queens, a middle-aged lawyer named John Szabo started getting visits in March 1980 from undocumented Polish laborers who said they were not being paid for their work. Before long, he would have dozens of clients from the same job. Szabo contacted Kaszycki, who was spending much of his time in Florida, but couldn&#8217;t reach him. So in late March, Szabo called Thomas Macari, a vice president in Trump&#8217;s operation, according to Szabo&#8217;s testimony. Macari, who could not be reached for comment, was overseeing the demolition job on a daily basis, according to the testimony of the Poles, Kaszycki and others in the case. If his clients weren&#8217;t paid, Szabo said, he would serve Trump with a mechanic&#8217;s lien, a powerful legal device that gives a laborer partial claim to the title of a property on which he has worked. Soon Trump, who toured the site on multiple occasions, according to the testimony of witnesses, had to address the issue himself. One evening in the spring of 1980, he met with some of the workers at the Bonwit Teller building, according to the testimony of one of the Poles on the job, Joseph Dabrowski. Kaszycki hadn&#8217;t been showing up on the job, and the Poles were angry about not being paid. Trump told them that if Kaszycki left the job for good, he would pay them himself, Dabrowski testified. And initially he made good on that promise. Trump used a bank account that required his signature to pay Kaszycki&#8217;s creditors, and Macari opened a new account requiring his own signature to pay the demolition workers. Macari paid the Polish workers cash for Trump, according to the sworn testimony of multiple witnesses. But still the Polish workers were paid inconsistently. Lipinski, who had become a foreman after his arm was crushed by the steel beam, took matters into his own hands. Around noon one afternoon, he walked across Fifth Avenue and into Trump&#8217;s office, Lipinski testified. &#8220;He spoke to the secretary and was surprised the secretary let him speak to Trump,&#8221; Lipinski&#8217;s son Jozef says in an interview this summer, sitting next to his father in his apartment in New York. Jozef says his father told him and his brother the story throughout their childhood: &#8220;Trump told him, &#8216;I paid the checks and anything I owed to the other guy, and he&#8217;s supposed to pay you.'&#8221; Now 80, Albin Lipinski is a U.S. citizen. Speaking through an interpreter at his home, he displayed his hand, still scarred from the accident, but says he supports Trump for President. Twenty-seven years after signing an affidavit about his meeting with Trump and testifying under oath about it, he now says he did go to Trump&#8217;s office but never met Trump. &#8220;I went to the office because I was mad I wasn&#8217;t being paid,&#8221; he says through a translator, but &#8220;I never met Trump.&#8221; Jozef and his brother say their father has begun forgetting things in his old age. By early June 1980, the Polish workers&#8217; unpaid wages totaled over $100,000. It was at this point, Sullivan later testified, that Trump asked the labor consultant for advice about the laborers. &#8220;I told him to fire them promptly if he had any brains,&#8221; Sullivan testified. Sullivan died in 1993. Trump initially ignored the advice. On June 27, 1980, the Poles&#8217; lawyer, Szabo, went to Trump&#8217;s office and served Trump with a mechanic&#8217;s lien, Szabo testified. Worse, the Polish workers were threatening violence, according to Sullivan&#8217;s testimony. &#8220;Donald called me at my home in Pennsylvania on June 27th, 1980, and asked could he see me immediately,&#8221; Sullivan testified. &#8220;He needed some help because the employees on the Bonwit Teller were threatening to hang a fellow named Tom Macari off the building and would I come to New York as soon as possible.&#8221; At his office on Fifth Avenue the next day, Trump told Sullivan he was in a bind: if he didn&#8217;t have the Bonwit building down by Sept. 1, he said, he was going to have to pay real estate taxes on it, Sullivan testified. Sullivan persuaded Trump to fire the Poles and rely only on union workers to get the building down. Worried the Poles would never get paid, Szabo put a second and third lien on the property. On Aug. 8, he called Macari and told him that because Trump had been paying the Poles, he was legally their employer. That meant that under the Fair Labor Standards Act, Trump couldn&#8217;t sell any space in the tower until Szabo&#8217;s clients were paid. Forty-five minutes later, Szabo testified, he received a call from a man who identified himself as a Mr. Barron from Trump&#8217;s legal department, who said Trump was going to sue Szabo for $100 million for wrongful filing of mechanic&#8217;s liens. At trial, Trump admitted that both he and a senior executive at the company had used the name Barron as a pseudonym. &#8220;I believe I occasionally used that name,&#8221; said Trump. But in this case, Macari said under oath that it had been he who called Szabo while posing as Barron; Szabo testified he didn&#8217;t recognize &#8220;Barron&#8217;s&#8221; voice. Szabo wrote a long letter defending his actions and laying out his case under the law and sent it to &#8220;Barron&#8221; on Aug. 18. A few days later, Szabo testified, he received a call from a real lawyer for Trump, Irwin Durben, who said Trump was threatening to ask the Immigration and Naturalization Service to have the Poles deported. By the fall, the Labor Department was investigating Trump and Kaszycki&#8217;s use of the undocumented workers. That winter, a Labor Department official made an appointment to inspect Trump&#8217;s employment records at the office across from the work site. Trump called Sullivan and asked him to attend the meeting with the federal investigator, according to Sullivan&#8217;s testimony. In the end, Szabo and the Labor Department won a judgment of $254,523.59 against Kaszycki. Trump never had to pay the Poles another cent. None of this history would have been preserved at the federal court storage facility near Kansas City, Mo., but for a separate fight over money and Trump&#8217;s use of the Polish workers. According to the contract Kaszycki had signed with Local 95 of the House Wreckers Union, he and Trump were supposed to pay into the union&#8217;s pension and welfare fund a percentage of every man-hour worked on the project, whether it was done by union or nonunion workers. A dissident member of Local 95, a former boxer named Harry Diduck, who has since died, realized Trump and Kaszycki had been paying the pension fund only for the hours the few dozen union workers had put in, not for the hours the Poles had worked. In 1983, Diduck and his lawyers, Burton Hall and Wendy Sloan, sued Kaszycki, the union president and subsequently Trump and others for the $600,000 they claimed Trump and his partners owed the pension fund. Over time, Sloan amassed thousands of pages of testimony from the Polish workers, Sullivan, Szabo, Macari and dozens of others. Trump fought her at every step.

The news compounds a string of recent findings that have pointed to poorer overall health for young American women. &#8220;Women now, compared to younger women generations before them, are less healthy,&#8221; says study co-author Melissa Caughey, a cardiovascular epidemiologist and instructor at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill School of Medicine. &#8220;It&#8217;s probably reflective of poorer health in general.&#8221; The study, which appeared in a special women&#8217;s health edition of the journal Circulation, looked at the medical records of nearly 30,000 people ages 35 to 74 who were hospitalized for a heart attack between 1995 and 2014. By the end of that time period, nearly a third of patients were considered &#8220;young&#8221; (ages 35 to 54), up from 27% in 1995 to 1999, according to the study. And that increase seemed to be driven largely by female patients, the paper says. From 1995-1999, 21% of hospitalized female heart attack patients were young. But by 2010-2014, that number had risen to 31%, the paper says. Meanwhile, younger patients accounted for a larger proportion of male heart attack hospitalizations, but rates increased more slowly, climbing from 30% to 33% of admissions between 1999 and 2014. The researchers also found that younger women who had heart attacks were more likely than men of the same age to have a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney disease and stroke. And it&#8217;s not the first paper to suggest that younger women&#8217;s overall health may be slipping. Studies have shown that rates of lung cancer are now higher in young women than young men, and rates of type 2 diabetes, suicide and depression are rising faster in young women and girls. Liver disease is also killing more young Americans than it once did, regardless of gender. Caughey says high rates of obesity and stress, and low rates of physical activity, among younger women could be to blame for some of these issues, though her study did not specifically look at these factors. She notes that obesity is more prevalent among younger women than younger men &mdash; and especially so for black women, among whom heart attacks are also disproportionately common. The study also showed that women still do not receive the same heart attack care that men do, a finding supported by plenty of prior research. Compared to men, &#8220;young women with heart attack are not receiving the same level of guideline-directed medications&#8221; such as lipid-lowering drugs, antiplatelet therapy and beta-blockers, Caughey says. Women also underwent invasive heart surgery less frequently than men. A large part of that discrepancy is likely because female heart attack symptoms tend to be harder to recognize than male warning signs, Caughey says. One 2018 study found that many women experience seemingly unrelated symptoms like nausea, indigestion, stomach pain, shortness of breath and jaw, neck and shoulder pain, which could obscure what&#8217;s really going on. But the fact that doctors do not always recognize these symptoms speaks to the reality that heart attack, as the paper&#8217;s authors write, is still considered &#8220;a man&#8217;s disease.&#8221; In reality, federal data shows that roughly the same number of men and women die of heart disease each year, and it remains the leading killer of both sexes. &#8220;Physicians tend to have lower suspicion of heart attack and heart disease&#8221; for women, Caughey says. &#8220;I&#8217;m hoping to bring more awareness.&#8221;"},"featured_media":5534499,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","categories":[430958269],"tags":[430965739,430939235,668],"paid":false,"display_modified_time":false,"_links":{"fortune:featured":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\u002F\u002Ftime.com\u002Fwp-json\u002Fti-api\u002Fv1\u002Ftime_collection_post\u002F5533708\u002Ffeatured"}],"fortune:primary_tag":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\u002F\u002Ftime.com\u002Fwp-json\u002Fti-api\u002Fv1\u002Ftime_collection_post\u002F5533708\u002Fprimary_tag"}],"fortune:primary_section":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\u002F\u002Ftime.com\u002Fwp-json\u002Fti-api\u002Fv1\u002Ftime_collection_post\u002F5533708\u002Fprimary_section"}]},"_embedded":{"fortune:featured":[{"size":"landscape","type":"video","visible":true,"image":{"id":5534499,"link":"https:\u002F\u002Ftimedotcom.files.wordpress.com\u002F2019\u002F02\u002Fwomen-heart-attacks.jpg?quality=85&zoom=2","alt":"Paramedics taking patient on stretcher from ambulance to hospital","caption":"","credit":"Getty Images","title":"Paramedics taking patient on stretcher from ambulance to hospital","src":{"square":"https:\u002F\u002Ftimedotcom.files.wordpress.com\u002F2019\u002F02\u002Fwomen-heart-attacks.jpg?quality=85&w=600&h=600&crop=1&zoom=2","landscape":"https:\u002F\u002Ftimedotcom.files.wordpress.com\u002F2019\u002F02\u002Fwomen-heart-attacks.jpg?quality=85&w=1100&h=550&crop=1"}},"video":{"id":"5592397360001","markup":"\u003Cdiv class=\"video-container\"\u003E\u003Cvideo id=\"brightcove-player-5592397360001\" data-video-id=\"5592397360001\" data-account=\"293884104\" data-player=\"SJa0Thl7\" data-embed=\"default\" controls preload=\"auto\" class=\"video-js responsive-video\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fvideo\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E","provider":"brightcove"},"structured":[{"tag":"video","attributes":{"controls":"1","videoid":"5592397360001"},"content":[]}]}],"fortune:primary_tag":[{"term_id":668,"name":"Research","slug":"research","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":1885,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":1075,"filter":"raw"}],"fortune:primary_section":[{"term_id":204777764,"name":"Health","slug":"health","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":21,"taxonomy":"time_section","description":"The latest health news, trends, and commentary from TIME, covering medicine, mental health, diet, fitness, sex, aging, disease, healthcare, policy and more","parent":0,"count":7756,"filter":"raw","all_sections":["health"]}]}},{"id":5530766,"date":"2019-02-20T15:35:16","date_gmt":"2019-02-20T20:35:16","guid":{"rendered":"http:\u002F\u002Ftime.com\u002F?p=5530766"},"modified":"2019-02-20T15:40:00","modified_gmt":"2019-02-20T20:40:00","slug":"tax-season-2019-changes","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"http:\u002F\u002Ftime.com\u002F5530766\u002Ftax-season-2019-changes\u002F","title":{"rendered":"Many Americans Are Shocked By Their Tax Returns in 2019.

The 2018 tax season saw about 70% of taxpayers receive a refund, according to the IRS.

Others have said they prefer to owe small amounts to the IRS because they don&#8217;t want to give what they see as an interest-free loan to the government. No matter what outcome taxpayers desire, they have take steps to prepare themselves properly, according to Ebel.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEbel says that instead of preparing, many people took the &#8220;wait and see approach&#8221; this year due to confusion over how the new tax law would affect them.

But it would help if people saw their refunds as just another paycheck, and not as extra money, according to Klontz.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&#8220;It helps to understand that it&#8217;s not actually a bonus from the IRS,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s a return of your money because you were overpaying your taxes.

The initial batch of tax refunds in the first two weeks of the season declined an average of 8.7% from last year as of Feb. 8, according to a report from the Internal Revenue Service. The average refund around the same time in 2018 was $2,135; this year, the number stands at $1,949. The changes likely stem from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act law that passed in December 2017, significantly overhauling the tax code in the U.S. Among the changes were new tax brackets, standard deductions and expanded credits for families with children. Changes in the new tax law could lead to confusion as people try to figure out how much they will receive in their refunds, or if they owe money to the IRS. Here&#8217;s what you should know about what&#8217;s different this year. What changed with the tax code from last year? Because so many pieces of the tax code shifted, it&#8217;s difficult to tell why certain people are affected differently than others, according to tax specialists and financial experts. But one place where people are likely to feel an impact comes from changes to withholding tables, which are guides that employers follow to deduct the proper amount from each employee&#8217;s paycheck for income tax. Under the new law, many people saw less money taken out of their paychecks, which has led to smaller tax refunds. Other changes to the tax law include the implementation of higher standard deduction for single filers at $12,000 and married couples filing jointly at $24,000 and a higher child tax credit, doubling to $2,000 per child from $1,000 per child last year. The law also meant the elimination of personal exemptions and limits to itemized deductions, such as a newly introduced $10,000 cap on deductions at the state and local levels. Those most likely to feel the impact are people who did not change how much they wanted withheld from their paychecks in their W-4 forms. Further, it&#8217;s emerged as people get ready for tax season that about half of Americans don&#8217;t understand how the new law affects their tax bracket and about 28% are unsure about what exactly shifted under the code, according NerdWallet&#8217;s 2019 Tax Study. That lack of awareness on part of taxpayers over what to do with their forms is probably driving the lower tax refund average, says Andrea Coombes, a tax specialist and writer at NerdWallet. &#8220;Because employers have to change their withholding tables based on the IRS&#8217;s new rules, people likely would have been enjoying more money in their paychecks over the course of the year,&#8221; she says. &#8220;That, in turn, could mean a smaller refund now.&#8221; Who is most affected by tax changes this year? Those most at risk for receiving less money in their tax refunds are taxpayers who itemize their deductions and have no dependents, homeowners in high tax states and employees who have unreimbursed business expenses, according to Lynn Ebel, the director of the Tax Institute at H&amp;R Block. Families with children under the age of 17 will likely get a higher refund, she says, because the child tax credit jumped in size under the law, to $2,000 per qualifying child plus a new $500 credit for other qualifying dependents. That the number of people who will receive lower-than-usual tax refunds will grow is quite likely, says Mark Jaeger, the director of tax development at the tax preparation firm TaxAct. &#8220;It&#8217;s a short window [the IRS] is reporting on, but it does seem like this is going to continue for at least this year,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Not everybody is going to see a tax decrease this year, but a majority should. It comes back to withholdings calculations.&#8221; Why do these tax changes feel so significant? The confusion over what people may or may not receive in their tax refunds contributes to a stressful climate, according to financial psychologist Brad Klontz. Money itself is already a significant stressor for Americans, according to the American Psychological Association, which found in a 2015 survey that money is the top cause of stress in the country. That pressure gets &#8220;exacerbated around tax season,&#8221; Klontz says. It&#8217;s still too early in the tax season to determine how many taxpayers are expected to receive a refund this year. The 2018 tax season saw about 70% of taxpayers receive a refund, according to the IRS. The average tax refund around the end of the second week of February was around $2,000 in 2017 and 2018. &#8220;It&#8217;s the one time of year where you&#8217;re forced to look at your financial life in great detail,&#8221; Klontz says. &#8220;People have a tendency to not think about it &mdash; one way to deal with stress is to be in denial about it.&#8221; This year could be a lot harder to deal with that stress, particularly if people receive notice that they owe taxes instead of a tax refund. Ashley Alt, an Illinois woman, told the New York Times she received a tax bill of $4,800 &mdash; far higher than the small amount she had expected to owe the IRS. Klontz says such people will feel the impact of tax season in a much more emotional way. What can you do about the change this tax season and next? The W-4 form allows taxpayers to tell their employers how much to take out of each paycheck for taxes. People can claim a number of allowances on the form, and the more they claim, the fewer taxes will be withheld, Coombes says. &#8220;If you got a big tax bill this year and you don&#8217;t want another one like that, you would use form W-4 to reduce your allowances,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Instead of five, claim one or two [allowances]. That will increase your withholdings over the year, and that will help you owe less next April.&#8221; People vary in terms of how they prefer to pay taxes and receive refunds. Some prefer to get a large chunk of money in their tax refunds, while others plan to receive $0 after having the right amount withheld all year from their paychecks, says Ebel. Others have said they prefer to owe small amounts to the IRS because they don&#8217;t want to give what they see as an interest-free loan to the government. No matter what outcome taxpayers desire, they have take steps to prepare themselves properly, according to Ebel. Ebel says that instead of preparing, many people took the &#8220;wait and see approach&#8221; this year due to confusion over how the new tax law would affect them. At H&amp;R Block, which helps people prepare their taxes, the company tried to educate their clients on the changes to the tax rules starting last year. There are several tools taxpayers can use to figure out what they&#8217;re paying, such as withholding calculators, or taking a deep look at what you paid in taxes in previous years. &#8220;Taxes can be a source of panic for people,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It&#8217;s not the most fun or sexy thing to talk about or to have a good understanding of.
