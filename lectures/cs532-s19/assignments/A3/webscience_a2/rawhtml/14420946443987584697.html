Trump has taken out his angst on House Intelligence Committee chairman <strong>Adam Schiff</strong> in particular, as Schiff and other Democrats on the panel prepare to launch a broad inquiry into the president&#x2019;s family business. &#x201C;After having found zero Russian Collusion,&#x201D; Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1093467800964866048">tweeted</a> Thursday, &#x201C;he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life, both financial and personal, even though there is no reason to be doing so.&#x201D;</p><!-- react-empty: 224 --><!-- react-empty: 225 --><!-- react-empty: 226 --><p data-reactid="227">But Democrats say there&#x2019;s plenty of reason.

There may have been other countries who have tried to financially influence him.&#x201D; Democrats are stepping up oversight efforts in other areas, too. In a hearing on Thursday, Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee will <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/07/ways-and-means--holds-hearing-on-tax-return-disclosures-for-candidates.html">reportedly</a> push for an ethics-reform package that requires presidential and vice-presidential candidates to disclose 10 years of tax returns.</p><p data-reactid="228">As the noose tightens, Trump&#x2014;who has so far enjoyed the protection of a Republican-controlled Congress&#x2014;is in revolt. &#x201C;If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,&#x201D; he declared during his State of the Union Address on Tuesday, a line that received <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-am-543af904-c49f-4d00-a769-d4e4e324dce1.html">scant applause</a>. &#x201C;I thought it was, frankly, kind of bizarre,&#x201D; Representative <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</strong> told NBC of Trump&#x2019;s ostensible threat. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think that investigations into federal misconduct have anything to do with our economy.&#x201D; Schiff echoed her comments on Wednesday, <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1093239752403443712">telling reporters</a>, &#x201C;I can understand why the idea of meaningful oversight terrifies the president.

So let’s just zero in on the money.\n<p>“I’m <em>really</em> rich,” Trump declared while announcing his candidacy in June 2015. To prove it, he released a “Summary of Net Worth” balance sheet, indicating a net worth of $8,737,540,000. A month later he upwardly revised that figure to “in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.” (The caps are his.)</p>\n<p>Since then, a cottage industry of spreadsheet-diving journalists has worked itself into a lather trying to peg his real net worth. But without tax returns to go on, it’s really anybody’s guess. Despite the all-caps figures Trump has dispensed, most estimates from the established financial-media outlets have been lower, FAR LOWER. <em>Forbes</em> put his net worth at $4.5 billion. <em>Fortune</em> postulated $3.7 billion, and later upped it to $3.9 billion. Bloomberg guessed it was “closer to $2.9 billion.”</p>\n<p>In response to these wanton guesstimates, Trump instinctually fired back at the guesstimators. “<em>Forbes</em> is a bankrupt magazine, doesn’t know what they’re talking about.” “<em>Fortune</em> has no idea what my assets are” and “has totally lost its way.” But the real sulfuric acid was reserved for the lowballers over at Bloomberg. As usual, Trump made it personal, even suggesting his “friend,” the former New York City mayor, might be jealous. “Maybe Michael told them to do it,” Trump speculated in the <em>Daily Mail,</em> “because he always wanted to do what I’m doing.” Perhaps wisely, <em>The New Yorker</em>&#8212;even with its legendary phalanx of persnickety fact-checkers&#8212;wouldn’t venture any closer than “just a back-of-the-envelope calculation” of $2.56 billion, “which shouldn’t be taken too seriously.”</p>\n<p>In November, Trump was elected president of the United States in a shocking turn of events. He lost the popular vote by some two million ballots.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/donald-trump","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"5748bf9ab58adb2f614da195","revision":5,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"August 1, 2017 5:46 pm","uri":"people/donald-trump"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Trump Reportedly Does All His Own Makeup","promoHed":"Trump Reportedly Does All His Own Makeup","dek":"If no tanning beds exist within White House walls, what is the source of Trump’s infamous hue?","promoDek":"If no tanning beds exist within White House walls, what is the source of Trump’s infamous hue?","body":"<p>Long before <strong>President Trump</strong> decried investigations of his office over Twitter, a gentler query dogged the celebrity businessman: how does he maintain his infamous orange hue, even while residing in wintry D.C.? It’s a question that persists into the third year of Trump’s tenure in the White House, and investigations of the matter have yielded surprising insight into the commander in chief’s styling habits.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/us/politics/trump-tan.html\">The New York Times</a></em> pursued the idea as a matter of Trump’s health, though a senior administration official only offered that Trump’s notable tan&#8212;in February, no less&#8212;is the result of “good genes.” Further investigation revealed that neither tanning beds nor spray-tan booths exist within the White House or Air Force One, at least according to senior officials. Former aide <strong>Omarosa Manigault Newman</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/death-spiral-why-omarosa-totally-triggered-trump\">wrote in a tell-all book</a> that Trump travels with a tanning bed, while lighter-hued circles around the president’s eyes have fueled speculation that he utilizes goggles to protect himself from ultraviolet rays.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, neither bronzer nor tanning cream has been observed among Trump’s bathroom grooming products, at least when the president has offered a tour of the facilities to supporters. Trump, who suffers from rosacea, is reported to apply his own translucent makeup powder before television appearances, and has even adjusted the lighting at White House events to avoid appearing too orange on-screen. When possible, he prefers the natural light of the White House Rose Garden.</p>\n<p>Trump’s orange hue has also proven a frequent source of media ridicule, even as <em>Saturday Night Live</em> star <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> has suggested makeup artists deliberately avoid exaggerating the shade&#8212;at <strong>Lorne Michaels’s</strong> behest&#8212;so as “not to over-orange anything out of malice.” Baldwin has otherwise described Trump’s look as somewhere between “Mark Rothko orange” and a “slightly paler Orange Crush.”</p>\n<p>The president is famously self-sufficient when it comes to appearance, even detailing the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/photos/2015/09/an-illustrated-history-of-donald-trumps-hair\">elaborate process</a> behind his signature swooping blond hair. And while an unnamed former campaign hand admitted Trump’s orange glow is “a captivating story,” they insisted Trump’s grooming habits are his own secret to keep.</p>","rubric":"45

on Friday, and has agreed to back pay some 800,000 federal workers the salaries they missed during the previous 35-day shutdown. But when it comes to the federal contractors who also went unpaid during that period&#8212;up to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/13/18223471/back-pay-federal-contractors-shutdown\">580,000 people</a>, according to one estimate&#8212;it gets trickier. “I’ve been told the president won’t sign” anything that guarantees them back pay, Senator <strong>Roy Blunt</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-blocking-contractor-back-pay-gov-t-funding-deal-lawmaker-n971226\">told reporters</a> on Wednesday. “I guess federal contractors are different in his view than federal employees.”</p>\n<p>On the 2016 campaign trail, it was a well-known (but ultimately overlooked) fact that Trump <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-business-plan-left-a-trail-of-unpaid-bills-1465504454\">routinely refused to pay contractors</a> during his career as a businessman. But the idea of paying these contractors reportedly had bipartisan support, until <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> shot it down. A legislative source <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/429827-push-to-include-contractor-back-pay-in-funding-deal-hits-gop-roadblock\">told</a> the Hill that the administrative cost alone to pay back the contractors would be as high as the back pay itself, and that previous shutdown negotiations did not include this provision. “That was not initially part of our deal,” Senator <strong>Richard Shelby</strong> explained. “I personally would rather keep it narrow in scope.”</p>\n<p>Other Republicans, such as <strong>John Cornyn,</strong> seemed to take joy in turning contractor pain to political gain. “<strong>[Nancy] Pelosi</strong> and <strong>[Chuck] Schumer</strong> should have thought about this and other collateral damage when they initially refused to negotiate on border security, something they are apparently now willing to do,” he told NBC News. “Thousands of federal contractors have not been reimbursed from the 35-day shutdown,” Schumer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1095770911196831744\">said</a> in response to these reports. “This issue is hanging in the balance. . . .

let go of his longtime rivalry with <em>S.N.L.,</em> squeezing in a ding at the “Democrat spin machine” here, a defense of <strong>Kanye West</strong> there, but largely ignoring its jabs. That appeared to change Sunday morning, as Trump resumed his full-throated attacks after a particularly scathing series of sketches. “Nothing funny about tired <em>Saturday Night Live</em> on Fake News NBC!” he tweeted.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The president presumably caught wind of Saturday’s cold open, which featured <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> reprising his long-standing impression to mock the president’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-national-emergency-declaration-wall\">declaration</a> of a national emergency on Friday.

You don’t have to be smart to understand that&#8212;in fact, it’s even easier to understand if you’re not that smart,” he said, increasingly stunting his grammar. “You can all see why I gotta fake this national emergency, right? I have to because I want to. It’s really simple. We have a problem. Drugs are coming into this country through no wall.”</p>\n<p>The impression also took aim at Trump’s own sing-song recital of the challenges his declaration will face in court.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ll immediately be sued, and the ruling will not go in my favor and then\nend up in the Supreme Court, and then I’ll call my buddy Kavanaugh\nand I’ll say, ‘It’s time to repay the Donny,’ and he’ll say, ‘New phone, who dis?’\nAnd by then the Mueller report will be released, crumbling my house of cards,\nand I can just plead insanity and do a few months in the puzzle factory and my\npersonal hell of playing president will finally be over.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the real Trump threatening “retribution” for NBC’s “Republican hit jobs,” the president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097117499336855553\">reiterated his talking point</a> that “THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!” Trump had kept largely silent on the topic of <em>S.N.L.</em> in recent months, only piping up when supporter Kanye West controversially <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/kanye-west-trump-rant-video-saturday-night-live-snl-chris-rock-instagram\">donned a “Make America Great Again” hat</a> in a September outro:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1046443996074127361\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1046443996074127361\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1046443996074127361</a></p></blockquote></div><p>He also raged against the network in December, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1074302851906707457\">tweeting</a>, “A REAL scandal is the one sided coverage, hour by hour, of networks like NBC &amp; Democrat spin machines like <em>Saturday Night Live.</em> It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials.

Get you a large adult son who can do both, as they say.</p>\n<p>Trump Jr. attended Malaysian designer <strong>Zang Toi’s</strong> show at Spring Studios on Wednesday. His look for the night was salt-and-pepper beard. Against all known <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/science-explains-why-a-beard-makes-you-look-hotter_n_6618142\">beard science, which states men look better with beards</a>, his look is more of a bot that is getting better and better at this smiling thing every day. His family <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2018/11/26/lead-pamela-brown-dnt-trump-ignoring-everything-jake-tapper.cnn\">has not put much faith in science</a>, anyway.</p>\n<p>Junior’s ex-stepmother, <strong>Marla Maples,</strong> was there, too, sitting a cool three seats away from him&#8212;close enough to look like they’re a part of one big party, and far enough away that she could convincingly avoid eye contact. (In past years, <a href=\"https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/presidents-former-wife-a-regular-zang-toi-10987395/\">Toi has invited</a> Junior’s mom and the president’s first ex-wife, <strong>Ivana Trump.</strong>) Between the biggest Trump boy and Maples was Fox News’ <em>America’s Newsroom</em> host <strong>Bill Hemmer</strong> and Fox News personality-turned-Don Jr’s girlfriend <strong>Kimberly Guilfoyle.</strong></p>\n<p>There at the fashion show, Junior told the press that he’s dating a cool girl. She fishes and shoots guns, he said, but also wears makeup and the fashions. “[Guilfoyle has] even been out with me down to Texas with some of my buddies there. They all go, ‘Hey, it’s a guy camp. Are you sure she’s going to be O.K.?’ I’m like, ‘Don’t worry, boys. I’m making you sign a waiver. She’s going to destroy all of you,’” he <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/02/13/donald-trump-jr-and-kimberly-guilfoyle-to-keep-it-low-key-for-valentines-day/\">told</a> the <em>New York Post.</em></p>\n<p>Toi’s finale look was an American flag skirt that could very well come to a <strong>Joy Villa</strong> near you next fall. (Wow, can’t believe this guy is co-signing a person dragging the American flag on the floor like that. What a shame&#8212;it’s like he doesn’t even respect America anymore, etc.) The designer made a special stop at the end of the runway to kiss Guilfoyle and shake Don’s hand. Who knows what he’s thinking as he smiles down at the designer. My best guess? “She’s going to destroy all of you,” over and over again, forever.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The dirty truth about <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/the-dirty-secret-of-el-chapo-downfall?inline\">El Chapo’s downfall</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; That time <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/brian-rea-modern-love-death-wins-a-goldfish?inline\">death took a break</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The 25 <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/25-best-movie-scenes?inline\">most influential movie scenes</a> of the past 25 years</p>\n<p>&#8212; Acupuncture and hypno-birthing?

Let Koch’s expert on water and chemical regulations decide.","body":"<p>Of all the federal agencies that fall under <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> purview, none embodies the administration’s unofficial mandate to do the exact opposite of its stated mission quite like the Environmental Protection Agency. For the last two years, the E.P.A.&#8212;which, as a reminder, is supposed to be protecting human health and the environment&#8212;has done everything in its power to turn the planet into an ashtray and convince Americans that toxic chemicals are actually totally fine to drink, breathe, and otherwise ingest, all in an effort to help companies secreting those chemicals maximize their profits. Which is to say, we probably should have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/04/former-koch-official-runs-epa-chemical-research-1136230\">seen this one coming</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Trump administration has placed a former Koch Industries official in charge of research that will shape how the government regulates a class of toxic chemicals contaminating millions of Americans’ drinking water&#8212;an issue that could have major financial repercussions for his former employer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Dunlap,</strong> a deputy in E.P.A.’s Office of Research and Development, is playing a key role as the agency decides how to protect people from the pollution left behind at hundreds of military bases and factories across the country. . .He spent the previous eight years as Koch Industries’ lead expert on water and chemical regulations, a position that typically includes helping companies to limit regulatory restrictions and liability for cleanups.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dunlap was hired in October, according to previously undisclosed documents. Since then, he has been extremely busy, having reportedly been involved in high-level meetings that preceded the agency’s decision <em>not</em> to set drinking water limits for chemicals known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which “have been linked with kidney and testicular cancer, as well as other ailments.” (In a statement, <strong>David Ross</strong>, EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Water, told the Hive: “Despite what is being reported, EPA has not finalized or publicly issued its PFAS management plan, and any information that speculates what is included in the plan is premature. The agency is committed to following the Safe Drinking Water Act process for evaluating new drinking water standards, which is just one of the many components of the draft plan that is currently undergoing interagency review.”) According to Politico, Dunlap has been able to avoid a Senate confirmation hearing in which his prior work experience might come up because Trump has not officially nominated anyone to run to office. (Dunlap’s <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/research/david-dunlap\">official bio</a> on the E.P.A. Web site declines to mention any of his employers during his “more than 30 years” working for “private industry, trade associations and as an environmental consultant.”) Currently, Koch subsidiary Georgia-Pacific, a paper and pulp conglomerate, is facing at least one class-action suit related to chemicals now under Dunlap’s purview.</p>\n<p>Koch’s various environmental crimes against humanity are laid out in several high-profile lawsuits over the past 20 years. According to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111005022145/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-02/koch-brothers-flout-law-getting-richer-with-secret-iran-sales.html\">Bloomberg</a>, “Koch Industries was assessed more than $400 million in fines, penalties, and judgments” between 1999 and 2003, such as for dumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of aviation fuel into a Minnesota wetland. “You want an independent, hardheaded scientific review of these issues; you don’t want somebody who is already taking the industry party line,” <strong>Erik Olson,</strong> who heads up the Natural Resources Defense Council’s public health work, told Politico. “There’s a legitimate threat there and, from my perspective, the conflicts of interest that [Dunlap] has having worked as a regulatory compliance director at Georgia-Pacific raises questions about whether he can make those objective decisions or should be recused.”</p>\n<p>Dunlap, of course, is unlikely to be replaced by someone without a host of conflicts of interest given that the guy currently running the E.P.A., <strong>Andrew Wheeler,</strong> is a walking, talking conflict of interest, having <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/07/06/626525274/get-to-know-andrew-wheeler-ex-coal-lobbyist-with-inside-track-to-lead-epa\">served as a coal-lobbyist</a> prior to taking over the top job from departed Grift King <strong>Scott Pruitt.</strong> It is, in other words, par for the course.

The president showed up about 40 minutes late to his planned speech Friday morning in the Rose Garden and immediately began rambling about trade negotiations with China. He proceeded to go on a long tangent about trade, Brexit, Syria, and his plans for a second summit with North Korea’s <strong>Kim Jong Un,</strong> all without the use of a teleprompter. Eventually he got to the point. “I’m going to be signing a national emergency,” Trump said. According to White House officials, the declaration will allow Trump to redirect $3.6 billion from the military, $2.5 billion from counter-narcotics programs, and $600 million from the Treasury to build a border wall that Congress refused to fund.</p>\n<p>Trump appeared resigned to being sued for what both Democrats and Republicans have denounced as an unconstitutional power grab. “We will have a national emergency, and we will then be <em>sued,</em>” he explained, breaking into a strange sing-song voice. “And they will sue us in the Ninth <em>Circuit,</em> even though it <em>shouldn’t</em> be there, and we will possibly get a bad <em>ruling,</em> and then we’ll get another bad <em>ruling,</em> and then we’ll end up in the Supreme <em>Court,</em> and hopefully we’ll get a fair <em>shake,</em> and we’ll win in the Supreme <em>Court</em> just like the <em>ban.</em>”</p>\n<p>The government lawyers who will inevitably have to argue that case were surely appalled by what came next. “We have so much money. But on the wall, they skimped,” he said, complaining that Congress had not given him the $5.7 billion in funding he wanted. “I didn’t need to do this,” he added, potentially undermining any legal justification for an emergency declaration. “But I’d rather do it much faster.”</p>\n<p>It is hard to capture in text the utter strangeness of the entire incoherent, self-defeating monologue. As always with Trump, the <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?457952-1/president-trump-sign-national-emergency-build-border-wall&amp;vod&amp;start=34\">full video</a> needs to be seen to be believed. But for those who can’t bring themselves to watch 50 minutes of the president praising himself and berating reporters, here are the most absurd highlights:</p>\n<p><strong>On other emergency declarations:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s been signed many times before. It’s been signed by other presidents. From 1977 or so, it gave the presidents the power. There’s rarely been a problem. They sign it; nobody cares. I guess they weren’t very exciting. But nobody cares. They sign it for far less important things in some cases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On executing drug dealers:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[In China] a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty. Our . . . drug dealer gets a thing called, “How about a fine?” . . .  So if we want to get smart, we can get smart. You can end the drug problem&#8212;can end it a lot faster than you think.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On Paul Ryan, who advised him against focusing on the wall:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will tell you, I’m very disappointed at certain people&#8212;particularly one&#8212;for not having pushed this faster.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On his biggest conservative fans:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Look, <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do. Not of me. If I change my views, he wouldn&#39;t be with me. <strong>Rush Limbaugh:</strong> I think he’s a great guy. Here’s a guy who could speak for three hours without a phone call. Try doing that sometime. For three hours, he speaks. He’s got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world. I mean, this guy is unbelievable. Try speaking for three hours without taking calls. Taking calls is easy. “O.K., I&#39;ll answer this one, that one.” He goes for three hours and he’s got an audience that’s fantastic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On his friendship with dictator Kim Jong Un:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was a very tough dialogue at the beginning. Fire and fury. Total annihilation. “My button is bigger than yours” and “my button works.” . . . [But] I like him a lot and he likes me a lot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On Ann Coulter, who has called his emergency declaration a scam:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ann Coulter,</strong> I don’t know her. I hardly know her. I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year. but the press loves saying “Ann Coulter.” Probably if I did speak to her, she’d be very nice. I just don’t have the time . . . I would speak to her, I have nothing against her. . . . But she&#39;s off the reservation. But anybody that knows her understands that. But I haven’t spoken to her. I don’t follow her. I don’t talk to her. But the press loves to bring up the name “Ann Coulter.” And you know what, I think she’s fine. . . . I just don’t speak to her.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On where he gets his (debunked) statistics on immigration:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I get my numbers from a lot of sources, like Homeland Security, primarily. And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster. And you know what else is a disaster? The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, <strong>Kirstjen [Nielsen],</strong> for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration. Billions and billions of dollars a month. Billions and billions of dollars and it’s unnecessary. . . . I use many stats . . . you have stats far worse than the ones I use, but I use many stats. But I also use Homeland Security.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On why he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, Part I:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think the people understand what we do. . . . Prime Minister <strong>[Shinzō] Abe</strong> [gave me]&#8212;it’s the most beautiful five-page letter. Nobel Prize. He sent it to them. You know why? Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan. And they had alarms going off&#8212;you know that. Now, all of a sudden, they feel good. They feel safe. I did that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On why he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, Part II:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you look at Idlib Province in Syria, I stopped the slaughter of perhaps three million people, nobody talk about that. . . . Russia and Iran and Syria were going to go in and perhaps destroy three million people in order to get 45,000 terrorists. And I heard about it from a woman who had her parents and her brother living there. And she said, “Please, please.” And I thought&#8212;I said, “No. It can’t happen. What are you talking about it?” “No, they’re going to. ” And I come home and I read a certain paper where the story was there, that they were actually forming to go into&#8212;to, really, to really do big destruction. And I put out a statement that, “You’d better not do it.” And in all fairness to Russia and Iran and Syria, they didn’t attack. Or they’re doing it surgically, at least. Saved a lot of people.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

troops depart.","promoDek":"America’s allies “unanimously” declined the Trump administration’s request to pick up the slack in Syria when U.S. troops depart.","body":"<p>Yet again, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has jumped the gun. Last week, the Trump administration revealed plans to remove all American troops from Syria by the end of April&#8212;a position long championed by the president. The move rankled even some congressional allies like Senator <strong>Lindsey Graham,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">apparently</a> made his displeasure known to Acting Defense Secretary <strong>Patrick Shanahan</strong> over the weekend. Now, it’s clear lawmakers weren’t the only ones blindsided by the planned withdrawal&#8212;key United States allies appear to have been left out of the loop as well.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/allies-say-they-wont-remain-in-syria-after-us-troops-withdraw/2019/02/20/62e503b2-3532-11e9-a400-e481bf264fdc_story.html?utm_term=.9c6870c65501\">reported</a> that U.S. allies “unanimously” declined the Trump administration’s request to pick up the slack fighting ISIS in Syria if the U.S. removes its troops in the spring, as Trump has apparently directed Shanahan to do. A senior administration official told the <em>Post</em> that allies have made it clear they “won’t stay if you pull out.” Trump’s hasty move, then, could leave behind a powder keg. “It’s not safe to leave these enemies there, without any referee or mediating force,” said a U.S. official.</p>\n<p>His approach to Syria is the latest example of Trump’s seeming tendency to push policy without working out the details, which has frustrated even some of his closest allies. “That’s the dumbest fucking idea I’ve ever heard,” Graham evidently <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">told</a> Shanahan of Trump’s withdrawal plan in a meeting in Munich last Saturday. The South Carolina Republican, normally a staunch defender of the president, has been venting about the administration’s Syria policy since December, when Trump suddenly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/donald-trump-syria-troops\">announced</a> it would be up to other nations to fight ISIS there&#8212;despite also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1075397797929775105\">claiming</a> that the terrorist organization had been “defeated.” Graham torched the policy, saying at the time that he would “hold the administration accountable for this decision,” and threatened hearings over the planned move.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to imagine that any president would wake up and make this kind of decision with this little communication,” Republican Senator <strong>Bob Corker</strong> said at the time.</p>\n<p>But it appears that’s precisely how Trump has approached one of the most complicated foreign-policy conundrums of his presidency. While the commander-in-chief seemingly continues to talk out of his ass&#8212;on Friday, he said he would announce the “eradication of the caliphate . . . over the next 24 hours,” but no such announcement has come&#8212;U.S. allies appear to be losing patience. Last week, French Foreign Minister <strong>Jean-Yves Le Drian</strong> <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/u-s-pullout-from-syria-benefits-iran-says-french-fm-1.6938647\">called</a> Trump’s call for withdrawal a “mystery,” and British Foreign Secretary <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> has said that “there is no prospect of British forces replacing the Americans” in Syria. Their pushback has left Trump hanging. Whether it will be enough to force him to reconsider remains to be seen.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a

Trump’s</strong> efforts to build a Trump Tower in Russia during the presidential campaign, <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> appeared Friday on ABC to downplay the controversial real-estate project&#8212;and put some distance between herself and the president. Asked by <strong>Abby Huntsman</strong> whether she had any concerns about the project, the senior White House adviser <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/08/politics/ivanka-trump-russia-investigation/index.html\">responded</a> that she knew “literally almost nothing” about a Trump Organization proposal to build a skyscraper in downtown Moscow, and said she had “zero concern” that anyone in her family could be implicated in <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> investigation into Russian efforts to fix the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Of course, Ivanka’s account differs somewhat from various reports suggesting she knew a great deal about the project. According to <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/mueller-eyes-ivanka-don-jr-s-work-trump-tower-moscow-003012099.html\">Yahoo News</a>, both she and <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong> were involved in the project as far back as 2013, and were aware that former Trump lawyer <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> had been working to revive the deal. In October 2015, Trump Sr. signed a letter of intent to move forward with negotiations, but has continued to be evasive about the extent of his ambitions. In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress about the scope of the Trump Tower project, and BuzzFeed News recently reported that the president directed Cohen to say that those negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did, though the special counsel’s office issued an unusual statement disputing the BuzzFeed story as “not accurate.”</p>\n<p>According to the contested BuzzFeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation\">report</a>, both Ivanka and Trump Jr. received “regular, detailed updates” about the project from Cohen. Ivanka would reportedly have managed a spa at the tower, and per BuzzFeed, instructed Cohen to speak with a Russian athlete who had “synergy on a government level” to move the project along. A spokesperson for the First Daughter’s attorney told BuzzFeed that she was only “minimally involved” in proceedings, and “did not know about this proposal until after a non-binding letter of intent had been signed.” Her older brother, meanwhile, has testified under oath that he was only “peripherally aware” of the plans.</p>\n<p>She contested the Yahoo report too, insisting that her involvement in the project was limited to recommending an architect. But in her interview with Huntsman, she offered additional explanations: the Moscow deal was one of many she was juggling, she was too busy to have paid much attention, and it never moved beyond a theoretical stage. “There was never a binding contract,” she told Huntsman during the <em>Good Morning America</em> interview, part of which aired Friday. “I never talked to the&#8212;with a third party outside of the organization about it. It was one of&#8212;I mean, we could have had 40 or 50 deals like that, that were floating around, that somebody was looking at. Nobody visited it to see if it was worth our time. So this was not exactly like an advanced project.”</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing there, yet it’s created weeks and weeks and months of headlines,” she added. “So no, I have zero concern.”</p>\n<h3>More

Chief among them, of course, have been Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-attacks-obstruction-investigation.html\">1,200 or so</a> public attacks on individuals and groups connected to inquiries into potential collusion between his campaign and Russia. (Trump has called <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> investigation a “witch hunt” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=witch%20hunt%20from%3Arealdonaldtrump&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en\">dozens of times on Twitter</a>; other times he just blurts “witch hunt!” without any context whatsoever.) There’s also the time he <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/donald-trump-fires-fbi-director-james-comey\">fired</a> the director of the F.B.I.; the private campaign to remove <strong>Jeff Sessions</strong> for failing to “protect him”; and the hiring of <strong>Rudy Giuliani,</strong> whose job has been to wage a public-relations war to “undermine the credibility of both Mr. Mueller and the Justice Department,” which has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/rudy-giuliani-robert-mueller-collusion-russia\">not worked out so well</a>. More recently, the president apparently used some precious hours of “Executive Time” to try to install a friendly face atop the investigation into his hush-money payments during the election.</p>\n<p>Last year, according to the <em>Times,</em> Trump summoned his newly installed acting attorney general, <strong>Matthew Whitaker</strong>&#8212;the one he claimed to not know despite <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/trump-denies-knowing-whitaker-who-he-met-a-dozen-times.html\">meeting with him on at least 12 separate occasions</a>&#8212;to ask him a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1068442531887632384\">very legal and very cool</a> question. Could <strong>Geoffrey Berman,</strong> the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, take over the investigation into <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-played-central-role-in-hush-payoffs-to-stormy-daniels-and-karen-mcdougal-1541786601\">Trump’s role</a> in paying porn star <strong>Stormy Daniels</strong> and former <em>Playboy</em> model <strong>Karen McDougal</strong> to keep quiet about their alleged affairs? In Berman, Trump obviously saw the perfect guy for the job, given his background as the son of a real-estate developer; his time <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/10/top-ny-prosecutor-geoffrey-berman-trump-appointee-recused-michael-cohen-inquiry/502367002/\">as a principal at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/rudy-giuliani-greenberg-traurig-resignation\">which previously employed Giuliani until the association likely became too mortifying to bear</a>; and his <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-thought-hed-picked-his-perfect-us-attorney-in-geoffrey-berman-he-was-very-wrong\">hefty donation to the Trump campaign in 2016</a>. In Whitaker, too, Trump presumably saw a guy with a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/matthew-whitaker-world-patent-marketing-scam\">somewhat elastic view of right and wrong</a>, who would be eager to do his bidding. But alas! It was not to be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Whitaker, who had privately told associates that part of his role at the Justice Department was to “jump on a grenade” for the president, knew he could not put Mr. Berman in charge because Mr. Berman had already recused himself from the investigation. The president soon soured on Mr. Whitaker, as he often does with his aides, and complained about his inability to pull levers at the Justice Department that could make the president’s many legal problems go away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The revelation not only highlights Trump’s continued reliance on <em>Sopranos</em>-esque tactics while working in the White House, but also puts Whitaker in an awkward situation vis-à-vis potentially lying to Congress:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Whitaker, who this month told a congressional committee that Mr. Trump had never pressured him over the various investigations, is now under scrutiny by House Democrats for possible perjury.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A spokeswoman for the Justice Department told the <em>Times</em> that the White House never asked Whitaker to interfere in the hush-money investigation. “Under oath to the House Judiciary Committee, then-Acting Attorney General Whitaker stated that ‘at no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel’s investigation or any other investigation,’” said <strong>Kerri Kupec.</strong> “Mr. Whitaker stands by his testimony.” Meanwhile, it will undoubtedly shock you to hear that Trump has dubbed the whole thing “fake news”:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962\">https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962</a></p></blockquote></div><h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Storms’-a-brewin","socialTitle":"Report: Trump Tried to Muzzle Investigation into His Porno Payoffs","socialDescription":"The president thought he could install a friendly face atop the probe.

href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/congress-reaches-deal-to-fund-quarter-of-trump-border-wall\">border-security deal</a> a bipartisan panel of Capitol Hill negotiators struck late Monday, despite the fact that it allots the president <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/12/18221468/congress-border-security-deal\">less money</a> in barrier funding than he was offered last year, before he shut down the government for five weeks. The president has made clear he’s no fan of the agreement, but with no Republican appetite for a second shutdown or unilateral action by the White House, and a Friday deadline looming, he may not have much of a choice&#8212;even as he leaves open the possibility of finding “other sources” to get the sum he’s spent months demanding. “I’m not happy about it,” Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/12/trump-meeting-cant-say-happy-border-deal-remarks-ip-vpx.cnn\">told reporters</a> of the deal on Tuesday. “It’s not doing the trick. But I’m adding things to it, and when you add whatever I have to add&#8212;it’s all gonna happen where we’re gonna build a beautiful, big, strong wall.”</p>\n<p>“It’s very simple,” he said.</p>\n<p>It makes sense that Trump isn’t thrilled about the deal. It includes just $1.375 billion for border fencing&#8212;far less than the nearly $6 billion he’d been seeking to build a concrete wall, and less even than the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/418507-schumer-dems-oppose-spending-more-than-16b-on-border-security\">$1.6 billion</a> <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> had offered him before Trump shut down the government last year. For the guy who authored <em>Art of the Deal,</em> it’s unquestionably a defeat&#8212;a fact his base has already picked up on. Rep. <strong>Mark Meadows,</strong> one of Trump’s top Hill allies, said on Monday that the bill “does not represent a fraction of what the president has promised the American people” and suggested he shouldn’t sign it. <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> Trump’s Fox News id, called the funding measure a “garbage compromise” when details first emerged.</p>\n<p>But Hannity has since softened, saying he’s “not as concerned” about Trump signing what he’d previously described as an “insane” deal&#8212;as long as he also declares a national emergency to get the rest of the money for the wall. “The president would need to declare a national emergency,” Hannity <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2019/02/12/sean-hannity-says-declaring-national-emergency-border-necessity/222852\">said</a> Tuesday. “This is the time. That is a necessity.” Trump, too, has hinted that he could pull additional cash from “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1095469449052868610\">other sources</a>,” a possible reference to the nuclear option he’s been threatening for weeks. “Was just presented the concept and parameters of the Border Security Deal by hard working Senator <strong>Richard Shelby,</strong>” Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1095469447933059073\">tweeted</a> Tuesday evening. “Looking over all aspects knowing that this will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources. . . . Regardless of Wall money, it is being built as we speak!”</p>\n<p>There is more than one way for the White House to tap those “other sources,” although each comes with potential legal hurdles. As Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/11/mick-mulvaney-border-wall-funds-1163996\">reported</a> on Monday, the White House has already developed plans to redirect unspent federal dollars as part of an executive order that would bypass Congress without requiring an emergency declaration. “There are certain sums of money that are available to the president, to any president,” Chief of Staff <strong>Mick Mulvaney</strong> explained Sunday on <em>Meet the Press.</em> “So you comb through the law at the president&#39;s request . . . And there’s pots of money where presidents, all presidents, have access to without a national emergency.” Experts say the move would almost certainly provoke a challenge.</p>\n<p>For now, at least, Trump’s signature on the bipartisan border deal would avert another destructive shutdown. But it’s not a done deal just yet. While the funding measure was agreed to in principle, Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2019/02/13/is-the-border-wall-deal-in-danger-of-falling-apart-392261\">reported</a> Wednesday that lawmakers have discovered some unresolved areas of contention as they’ve worked to finalize it. That could be troublesome with a Friday deadline fast approaching&#8212;especially when the ultimate decision comes down to an unpredictable president whose whims can change with the wind.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

Republicans’ grip on the federal purse strings, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is set to bypass Congress and use the nuclear option to build his long-promised wall at the United States-Mexico border. It’s a move that will trigger a tough, protracted legal fight&#8212;and one that could even cause a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/trump-declares-national-emergency-border-wall-funding\">rift within the G.O.P.</a>, where leadership previously warned the president against an emergency declaration.</p>\n<p>Democrats, naturally, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/national-emergency-blocked-courts-temporarily-doj-warns-white/story?id=61086962\">labeled</a> the move “crazy,” “ridiculous,” and something “all of us will come to regret.” But Thursday also saw renewed cries of alarm from Republicans. Senator <strong>Susan Collins,</strong> who has criticized Trump in the past, released a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorCollins/status/1096175131733475330\">statement</a> calling the administration’s plan B a “mistake.” “Such a declaration would undermine the role of Congress and the appropriations process,” Collins said, warning of the precedent it could set. Kentucky Senator <strong>Rand Paul,</strong> a proponent of limited government, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096149684840738816\">told a reporter</a> he was “not in favor” of the plan, saying that “revenue raising and spending power was given to Congress” and suggesting that going around lawmakers would be an abuse of executive power. And Alaska Senator <strong>Lisa Murkowski,</strong> who’s stood up to the administration before, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096151375875133440\">said</a> she “[doesn’t] think this is a matter that should be declared a national emergency.”</p>\n<p>“I wish he wouldn’t have done it,” Senator <strong>Chuck Grassley</strong> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/14/gop-national-emergency-declaration-trump-1170697\">told</a> Politico. “I imagine we’ll find out whether he’s got the authority to do it by the courts.”</p>\n<p>“I never thought that was a good idea,” Republican Senator <strong>Pat Toomey</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096153688681467905\">told a reporter</a>. “I still don’t.”</p>\n<p>Trump had long suggested he’d employ the nuclear option, having previously called the bipartisan talks that led to this week’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/congress-reaches-deal-to-fund-quarter-of-trump-border-wall\">border-security agreement</a> a “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/trump-great-negotiator-gives-up-on-negotiating-border-wall-national-emergency\">waste of time</a>.” He’d even <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/republicans-think-trump-nuclear-option-national-emergency-is-a-terrible-idea\">implied</a> that he would declare a national emergency during his State of the Union address earlier this month, but ultimately decided against it amid bipartisan backlash&#8212;including from Senate Majority Leader <strong>Mitch McConnell.</strong></p>\n<p>Now, though, Trump is planning to sign the bipartisan deal <em>and</em> employ the nuclear option. That will likely please his base, including <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> who signaled this week that the only way he’d give his blessing to the “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-prepares-to-sign-garbage-compromise-on-border-wall-funding\">garbage compromise</a>” would be if the president accompanied his signature with a national emergency. It’ll also please some of his Capitol Hill allies, including <strong>Lindsey Graham,</strong> who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GarrettHaake/status/1096144722215743489\">said</a> Thursday that “this is a political fight worth having.”</p>\n<p>It remains to be seen whether pushback from lawmakers can overcome the kudos from Trump’s base. That, after all, is one of the defining problems of Republican criticisms of Trump: that his detractors, time and again, have proven far more pliable than his allies. McConnell, who had previously opposed the nuclear option, announced his support on the Senate floor Thursday. And even those who expressed concern with the maneuver seemingly left themselves wiggle room. Take <strong>Marco Rubio:</strong> the Florida Republican indicated he believes Trump may be violating the Constitution if he bypasses Congress to build the wall&#8212;but only went so far as to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenRubioPress/status/1096172609392254978\">say</a> he is “skeptical it will be something [he] can support.” “I will wait to see what statutory or constitutional power the President relies on to justify such a declaration before making any definitive statement,” he said.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and

asked if it should register as a foreign agent.","body":"<p>Last March, shortly before Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman</strong> arrived in America to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/prince-mohammed-does-hollywood\">pitch</a> his younger, hipper brand of authoritarianism, American Media Inc. produced an ad-free, 97-page tribute to

promoting his Vision 2030 plan, and dubbing the kingdom “Our Closest Middle East Ally Destroying Terrorism,” the whole thing read like a vintage issue of <em>Tiger Beat.</em> Except, of course, that instead of fawning over young actors and boy bands, the gushing was reserved for a dictator <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/11/08/saudi-arabia-and-the-united-arab-emirates-are-starving-yemenis-to-death-mbs-khashoggi-famine-yemen-blockade-houthis/\">starving the people of Yemen</a> and who, just a few months later, would allegedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/politics/cia-saudi-crown-prince-khashoggi.html\">order the hit</a> on journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi.</p>\n<p>The $13.99 magazine was presumably a hit in the Oval Office, held up as a piece of real journalism by <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and his son-in-law, who’d been working to forge a close connection with the Saudis since January 2017, but to the outside world it might as well have been a special issue praising the leadership of Benito Mussolini. In fact, the whole thing felt so bizarre and over-the-top obsequious that A.M.I. apparently had some qualms of its own.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/national-enquirer-publisher-asked-justice-department-for-advice-on-saudi-connection-11549908996\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, the publisher “sought advice from the Justice Department” last year over whether its obvious propaganda would cross the line between substandard journalism and literally working as an agent of a foreign government. While A.M.I. claimed in the past that Saudi officials had no role in the magazine’s creation, in fact, the publisher gave an adviser to the Kingdom a draft of the magazine and followed the adviser’s editorial advice, per a letter to the D.O.J. However, because there was no official contract stating the company <em>had</em> to follow the adviser’s suggestions&#8212;because, in other words, A.M.I. did so simply out of its love for M.B.S., or as a person familiar with the matter put it, in an attempt to “kiss his ass”&#8212;the Justice Department ruled that the publisher was not required to register as a foreign agent, a conclusion it warned could change if the facts “are different in any way from those depicted in your submission.”</p>\n<p>Of course, last summer’s glossy isn’t the only time A.M.I. has crossed paths with the Kingdom, directly or indirectly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In recent years, American Media sought Saudi financial backing to finance a failed effort to acquire <em>Time</em> magazine, <em>Sports Illustrated,</em> <em>Fortune,</em> and <em>Money,</em> the <em>Journal</em> reported last year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>American Media confirmed the contacts but said the only deal that has ever been discussed with Saudi investors was the expansion of the Mr. Olympia bodybuilding competition, which American Media owns, into the Middle East and North Africa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The lawyer for [publisher <strong>David] Pecker,</strong> <strong>Elkan Abramowitz,</strong> on Sunday on ABC said American Media sought financing “from the Saudis, but never obtained any.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s also the matter of A.M.I.’s long-standing ties to Trump, who has gone out of his way to support Saudi Arabia, including (allegedly!) <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/unusual-statement-disputing-cia-filled-exclamation-points-trump-backs-saudi-n938526\">letting its de facto leader get away with the murder of a U.S. resident</a>. That issue came up last week, when Amazon founder <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> published a blog post <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-ami-medium\">accusing</a> <em>The National Enquirer</em> of attempting to extort him if he didn’t drop his investigation into how his private messages fell into their lap, and publicly state that that he had “no knowledge or basis for suggesting that A.M.I.’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.” As Bezos wrote in his <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/hes-a-genius-wall-street-praises-bezos-for-dick-pic-moxie\">widely praised dick-pic confessional</a>, “the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve.”</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Trump wants investigation into his sham charity halted because New York A.G.s were mean to him</strong></p>\n<p>Back in December, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/donald-trump-charity-shut-down\">shuttered</a> the Donald J. Trump Foundation as part of an agreement with the New York Attorney General’s office, which has alleged that the “charity” served as little more than a slush fund for the former real-estate developer’s business and political interests. In addition to allegedly spending $10,000 of the foundation’s money <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-clue-to-the-whereabouts-of-the-6-foot-tall-portrait-of-donald-trump/2016/09/14/ae65db82-7a8f-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html?utm_term=.76892d132ab1\">on a six-foot-tall oil painting of Trump</a>, the group’s board, made up of the president’s eldest children, never once held a meeting. (Trump Organization C.F.O. <strong>Allen Weisselberg</strong> apparently had no idea he was an officer <a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/779101/trump-foundations-treasurer-didnt-know-treasurer-until-investigators-told\">until investigators told him as much</a>.) Unfortunately for the Donald, simply closing the (<em>alleged</em>) sham charity has not stopped the investigation. “We’ll continue to move our suit forward to ensure that the Trump Foundation and its directors are held to account for their clear and repeated violations of state and federal law,” outgoing N.Y. A.G. <strong>Barbara Underwood</strong> said at the time. So now <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-11/trump-renews-claim-that-n-y-suit-against-his-charity-is-biased\">his lawyers are trying to get it thrown out on the grounds that investigators said mean things about him</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>New York’s June lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation should be barred over comments made by [the state’s new attorney general, <strong>Letitia] James,</strong> and predecessors Barbara Underwood and <strong>Eric Schneiderman,</strong> who were both vocal Trump critics, Trump’s attorney <strong>Alan Futerfas</strong> said in documents filed last week in state court in Manhattan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>James called Trump an “illegitimate president” in the months before her November election and vowed to “use every area of the law” to investigate the real-estate mogul, his businesses, and his family, according to the filing. Statements by all three attorneys general “express clear bias and animus and constitute an unlawful appearance of impropriety.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, it’s not surprising that a person vowing to use “the law” to investigate the president would send shivers down Team Trump’s collective spine, though it’s not clear this tack will work after having already failed a first time. Back in November, New York State Supreme Court Justice <strong>Saliann Scarpulla</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-23/trump-foundation-must-defend-attorney-general-suit-judge-says\">rejected</a> Trump’s attorneys’ attempt to get the suit dismissed on claims of “political bias,” saying, “There is no basis for finding that animus and bias were the sole motivating factors for initiating the investigation and pursuing this proceeding.” Or, in other words, <em>these officials might think you’re the world’s slimiest weasel, but that’s not the ONLY reason they launched this probe.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Founding member of the “Trump Caucus” still blowing campaign funds on leisure-time activities</strong></p>\n<p>Remember Rep. <strong>Duncan Hunter</strong>? For those who need a quick refresher, he’s the California congressman and Trump super-fan who was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/duncan-hunter-indictment\">indicted last year</a>, along with his wife, <strong>Margaret Hunter,</strong> on charges of wire fraud, falsifying records, campaign-finance violations, conspiracy, and “convert[ing] campaign funds to personal use,” the latter of which allegedly <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/22/politics/duncan-hunter-indicted/index.html\">included</a>: a 2015 family vacation to Italy that cost more than $14,000; a $6,500 spring-break trip to Hawaii; a $3,700 jaunt to Las Vegas and Boise; $229 at Disneyland’s Star Trader gift shop; $253.62 at SeaWorld’s Aquatica waterpark; meals at fine-dining establishments and fast-food restaurants alike; a $2,000 birthday gift for a family member to attend a Pittsburgh Steelers game; and a three-night, $1,000 stay at the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa and Casino for a “personal ski trip,” among other things. At the time, the Hunters insisted through a spokesman that the indictment against them was “politically motivated,” with Duncan later trying to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/23/politics/duncan-hunter-wife-margaret-campaign-finances/index.html\">blame everything on his wife</a>. Anyway, it appears that <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-hunter-douglas-drones-20190206-story.html\">the couple is up to their old tricks</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the last five weeks of 2018, Rep. Duncan Hunter’s campaign reported spending hundreds of dollars at a local amusement park and made $2,000 in charges&#8212;now disputed&#8212;to a technology company that flies drones. The spending at Belmont Park, [an amusement park] in Mission Beach, and the disputed charges at ByteSignal, a Missouri-based technology company, are among $119,861 in expenditures Hunter’s campaign disclosed to the Federal Election Commission on Thursday, in a financial report covering November 27 through December 31. During the same weeks, the campaign reported raising $2,376.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, these expenditures are a drop in the bucket compared to the $250,000 in campaign funds the Hunters allegedly misappropriated between 2009 and 2016, but if you’re facing a criminal trial&#8212;the couple has pleaded not guilty&#8212;maybe just use your own money at the amusement park.</p>\n<p><strong>Report: another shutdown would have not-great consequences</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to putting nearly 1 million federal employees out of work (or forcing them to work without pay), a second potential shutdown would <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-11/debt-limit-looms-as-mind-numbing-impasse-stokes-shutdown-risk\">put the U.S. economy at major risk</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The standoff in Washington that’s increasing the chances of another U.S. government shutdown at the end of the week is also raising the specter of bigger risks as the reinstatement of the debt ceiling approaches in early March.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moody’s Investors Service analysts have warned that shutdown 2.0 could have a “more severe impact” on U.S. output. And if it were to extend beyond the March 1 end of the suspension of the current cap on America’s statutory debt capacity, “it would complicate negotiations over the debt ceiling.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Last month, Fitch Ratings’ global head of sovereign ratings, <strong>James McCormack,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-is-turning-america-into-another-bankrupt-casino\">warned</a> that the country’s mounting debt is weighing on the U.S., and the inability to deal with “meaningful fiscal deterioration” with a shut government could put our triple-A rating at risk. (A credit downgrade&#8212;which has only happened once since 1941&#8212;would make it harder for the U.S. government to borrow money and increase borrowing costs.)</p>\n<p><strong>Area man doesn’t understand why Democrats get themselves so wound up over investigations, fascism, the law, etc.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094964052558823424\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094964052558823424\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094964052558823424</a></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>Morgan Stanley, in Its Biggest Deal Since Crisis, Courts Future Millionaires (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-in-its-biggest-deal-since-crisis-courts-future-millionaires-11549885394\"><em>W.S.J.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Kamala Harris calls for marijuana legalization: ‘I think it gives a lot of people joy’ (<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/11/kamala-harris-2020-marijuana-legalization-1163795\">Politico</a>)</p>\n<p>She Spoke Up About Sexual Harassment At Ernst &amp; Young And Got Caught In A Web of Retaliation (<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ernst-and-young-sexual-harassment-karen-ward_us_5c14080ee4b009b8aea73086\">HuffPost</a>)</p>\n<p>Millions of Americans could be stunned as their tax refunds shrink (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/02/10/millions-americans-could-be-stunned-their-tax-refunds-shrink/\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>)</p>\n<p>The Next Wave of ‘Unicorn’ Start-Ups (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/technology/new-wave-unicorn-start-ups.html\"><em>N.Y.T.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Grading the impact of Trump’s China tariffs (<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-tariffs-china-trade-war-impact-8dd42cf5-983a-4eb9-a111-16132eeef1f8.html\">Axios</a>)</p>\n<p>Fyre Fest founder ordered to pay $2.9M to investment company (<a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/02/08/fyre-fest-founder-ordered-to-pay-2-9m-to-investment-company/\"><em>N.Y.P.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Cows Get Own Tinder-Style App for Breeding (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-10/cows-get-tinder-app-as-u-k-breeders-seek-moo-love-for-herds\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>Does Your Company Need to Know Your Body-Mass Index?

obama","data":{"id":"5744a8bbc1f81aa45c811812","modelName":"person","collection":"people","canonicalUrl":"https://www.vanityfair.compeople/barack-obama","givenName":"Barack","familyName":"Obama","bio":"“If this was a boxing match, the referee would have stopped it,” Romney’s campaign spokesman, Eric Fehrnstrom, gleefully declared in the spin room after the first Romney-Obama debate in October 2012. Obama had appeared tired, irritated, on the defensive. <em>The New York Times</em> noted his “flat, uninspired” performance. Even diehard Obama fan Andrew Sullivan tweeted, “He’s boring, abstract, and”&#8212;cue the ultimate zinger&#8212;“less human-seeming than Romney.” But it was James Carville who finally put a finger on it: “It looked like President Obama didn’t really want to be there!”\n<p>The first Romney debate was a significant waypoint in Obama’s slow drift from ebullient optimist to cranky, deflated cynic, sparking speculation that he might just be over being president. Republicans from Chris Christie (“I don’t think he likes being president”) to Donald Trump (“He’s just not into it”) made note. So did the liberal media, perhaps feeling betrayed by the vanishing act of their heretofore cheerleader in chief. Salon asked in a headline, “Does Obama just hate his job?” *Harper’*s Kevin Baker reminded readers, “Barack Obama has repeatedly informed us that he hates living in the White House and can’t wait to be an ex-president.”</p>\n<p>But Obama, an indefatigable basketball fan, soon turned it around and flashed his competitive side. He roundly beat Romney in the second and third debates, before soaring through November and concluding one of the most quietly accomplished portfolios of any president in the modern era: auto-industry bailout, Wall Street reforms, new fuel-efficiency standards, increased aid to veterans, expanded F.D.A. food-safety oversight, gay marriage, getting private lenders out of the federal student-loan program, the Iran deal, and of course, the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare. Not to mention ending the war in Iraq and drawing down our presence in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>So what’s next for the Obamas? “All the strands of my life came together, and I really became a man when I moved to Chicago,” Obama said in May 2015, announcing Chicago as the future home of his presidential library and leading to speculation that the departing First Family will resettle in the Windy City. Others had predicted Hawaii, Obama’s home state, as nice a place as any to unwind. Finally, in March, Obama put an end to the guessing game: the family will remain in Washington at least until youngest daughter Sasha graduates from high school in 2019.

As the public’s attention starts to focus on the primaries of 2020&#8212;<em>God, didn’t we just do this?</em>&#8212;many Democrats are acting as if <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> who’s having a good day when his approval ratings stay in the 40s, would beat most of the field. Maybe that’s because they’re still recovering from the shock of 2016. But maybe it’s more serious than that. If today’s Democrats can’t beat Trump, then maybe <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> wasn’t as bad a candidate as her critics claimed. And if Clinton wasn’t the problem, then what was the problem? Such questions are behind a recent spike of debates on the left over <strong>Barack Obama’s</strong> record. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1078689102797492229\">More</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeGrunwald/status/1078686964566712321\">more</a> voices seem to be saying, either obliquely or bluntly, that Obama was a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1080265059576745986\">bad president</a>.</p>\n<p>Certainly, almost anyone on the left will agree that Obama was preferable to his Republican opponents. If they object to how Obama handled issues such as health care, finance capitalism, immigration, economic stimulus, trade, or war and peace, it’s not because they feel a Republican president would have been better. That makes it tempting to say that Obama is being criticized only for pushing insufficiently to the left, settling for the Affordable Care Act rather than Medicare for All or a stimulus package under a trillion dollars rather than one twice that size. But such an explanation tends to assume a difference of degree rather than kind, with Obama dwelling in a more purplish spot than his bluer critics. In reality, the categories that matter as much as left and right are those of establishment and radical. Obama’s record of siding reliably with the former at a time when the zeitgeist had come to favor the latter is the source of much of the tension over his legacy.</p>\n<p>The categories of establishment and radical are tricky to define, except to say that the former wishes to preserve much of the status quo, while the latter seeks more fundamental change. If one side is full of people with opinions on how to set the dials, the other is full of people who say we need a new instrumental panel. This creates interesting alliances of left and right, ones that are less a union of extremes&#8212;a product of what political scientists call “horseshoe theory”&#8212;and more a union of dissent. A radical is <em>not</em> an extremist, necessarily. It’s someone who believes the fundamentals are flawed.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Many of the disputes between today’s establishment and its radicals are merely continuations of where we were about 25 years ago. When <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> intervened in the war over Kosovo, in 1999, the establishment center supported him, while the outer bands of right and left opposed it. Similarly, trade agreements such as NAFTA in 1993 and GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) in 1994, passed on the strength of a broad center, while Democrats and Republicans on the edges voted no. On immigration, the center took a high-influx view while the disruptors took a more restrictive one. On business policy, the establishment center supported things like the Export-Import Bank of the United States, while the left and right radicals deplored it as a special interest or, as a candidate named Barack Obama would one day put it, corporate welfare.</p>\n<p>Several factors reduced the urgency of these divisions for about a decade. One was blistering economic growth in the late 1990s. Another was a reasonably harmonious world. Then came 9/11, which reshuffled everything but also caused the right (with plucky exceptions such as <strong>Ron Paul</strong> and the founders of <em>The American Conservative</em>) to put aside internal disputes and, for the most part, fall in line behind <strong>George W. Bush.</strong> After the failures of Iraq and other Bush policies, though, the divisions roared back to life. If there was a crystallizing moment, it was when Wall Street as we knew it was about to collapse. In the eyes of the establishment, left and right, an unforeseeable real-estate crash had threatened the survival of the country’s vibrant financial sector and, with it, the wallets and neighborhood A.T.M.s of every American. In the eyes of the radicals, our financial sector was an out-of-control predator built on a rotten edifice that was finally about to crumble. Its collapse wasn’t the threat; it was the cure. For the first time in years, an immense policy question was breaking out not between parties but within them. Among both Democrats and Republicans, an establishment wing was supporting the bailouts, while the radical wing was opposing them.</p>\n<p>This was Obama’s moment of truth, and it happened months before he was elected. Would presidential candidate Barack Obama side with the radicals? Much of his campaign rhetoric suggested he would. Or would he side with the establishment? Again, much of his campaign rhetoric suggested he would. We all know how he chose, and people will long debate whether it was right or wrong. Siding with the establishment certainly earned him plenty of defenders, and it was the safer choice. But it also came at great cost. Only <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/only-one-top-banker-jail-financial-crisis.html\">one Wall Street executive</a> ever went to prison for his part in the financial crisis. For millions of Americans, any residual trust in the competence and integrity of the ruling class was lost, and Obama had become part of the problem.</p>\n<p>From that point on, it was predictable that Obama, when forced to choose, would side with the establishment. Those who knew best told him to send a surge of troops to Afghanistan, so he did it. They told him to keep the records of detainee abuse under Bush concealed, so he hid them. They said that nationalizing the banks or prosecuting the executives would be too risky, so he avoided it. They said that our trade agreements enriched the nation, so he promoted them. They called him callous when he originally refused to intervene in Libya, so he toppled its leader.</p>\n<p>Many of these positions, welcome as they were within the Beltway, were out of sync with the mood of the country. In the 1990s, the radicals had been on the fringes, but that was no longer the case after 2008. An anti-war and anti-corporatist message sent Ron Paul riding surprisingly high in 2012, and a filibuster by <strong>Rand Paul</strong> in 2015 over the issue of drone strikes prompted even Democrats to deploy the #StandWithRand hashtag. Tea Party Republicans began to team up with Democratic union members to oppose Obama’s trade deals. Fury over the bank bailouts made its way into the congressional campaigns of Republicans and Democrats alike.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Where does this leave us, and what does it portend for Democrats in 2020? On the one hand, it’s unfair to call Barack Obama an establishment president, with all the status-quo overtones of the term. He gave us the Affordable Care Act, the stimulus, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform, an executive action for Dreamers, the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” a nuclear deal with Iran, diplomatic relations with Cuba, a climate deal in Paris, a New START treaty, a reform of student-loan programs, and two liberal Supreme Court appointments. On the other hand, many of the country’s most ominous trends proceeded apace under his watch. The financialization of the economy kept increasing. Student debt kept exploding. Trade policy kept its same priorities. Opioid addiction kept spreading. Suicide numbers kept rising. Disparities in life expectancy between rich and poor kept widening. Union membership kept declining. Illegal border-crossers kept coming. Our defense commitments kept growing. In towns like Jasper, Indiana, and Mebane, North Carolina, factory workers&#8212;a hundred here, a couple of hundred there&#8212;kept losing their middle-class jobs, outcompeted by giant Chinese mills with appalling conditions.</p>\n<p>The concise and indispensable new book <em>The Nationalist Revival,</em> by the left-leaning <strong>John B. Judis,</strong> contains one especially haunting statistic: 3.4 million jobs lost to the growth of trade with China since 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organization. For many of these forgotten Americans, Obama’s final State of the Union address lauding a manufacturing surge rang hollow, and so did his vision of making “change work for us, always extending America’s promise outward, to the next frontier, to more people.” They had already heard, many times, that “they may have to retool, they may have to re-train.” It was Bill Clinton, still a canny reader of the public, at times, who had to observe that “millions of people look at that pretty picture of America he painted and they cannot find themselves in it.”</p>\n<p>Radicalism deferred was radicalism intensified. Donald Trump is failing in countless ways, but he is, if nothing else, a radical&#8212;so much so that telling him he can’t do something makes him likelier to do it. Elizabeth Warren is betting that voters will see her as a radical, even though she’ll have to embrace Obama’s record along with her own. Joe Biden is betting that Americans are done with Trump’s experiment and wish to return to the establishment. Other Democrats, such as <strong>Cory Booker</strong> and <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> and <strong>Beto O’Rourke,</strong> seem to be betting on a bit of both&#8212;establishment-friendly economics and radical-friendly social views&#8212;assisted by charisma, youth, and identity. Each bet could win or lose, because Trump is a wild card. Still, while revolution must give way to a new establishment eventually, the mood doesn’t seem to favor it yet, and our shifts are still ongoing. (Just look at <strong>Tucker Carlson’s</strong> recent <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-mitt-romney-supports-the-status-quo-but-for-everyone-else-its-infuriating\">monologue</a> attacking our ruling class and its quest to “make the world safe for banking.” Much of it could have been delivered by <strong>Bernie Sanders.</strong>) You could say Obama spent eight years deferring a radical disruption. His tragedy is that he could have led it.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Democrats","socialTitle":"Hope vs. Change: Why Some Democrats Are Turning on Obama’s Legacy","socialDescription":"Obama was a visionary who gave us the Affordable Care Act, DACA, and the Paris deal, but many of the country’s most ominous trends also proceeded apace under his watch.

prepares to bid 2018 farewell, <strong>Barack Obama</strong> has once again joined in a favorite Internet tradition, holding strong opinions about his favorite books, songs, and movies of the year. (Former presidents&#8212;they’re just like us!) As Obama explained in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/barackobama/posts/10156393283416749\">Facebook post</a>, the ritual of making a list is a favorite of his, as it affords him a moment to reflect on some of his favorite art. He added, in a subtle post-presidential flex, “It also gives me a chance to highlight talented authors, artists, and storytellers&#8212;some who are household names and others who you may not have heard of before.” Overall, Obama’s taste is quintessentially “cool dad”&#8212;it’s rife with picks that run the gamut of style and aesthetic, with a few well-chosen surprises peppered throughout. The author of his top book of the year, however, is adorably obvious.</p>\n<p>His book list was divided into books by authors who have appeared on earlier lists and those by his new favorites. At the top, of course, was <strong>Michelle Obama’s</strong> <em>Becoming</em>&#8212;with the parenthetical note, “obviously my favorite!” Other picks included literary fiction and nonfiction, such as <strong>Tayari Jones’s</strong> <em>An American Marriage</em>&#8212;an Oprah’s Book Club 2018 selection as well&#8212;<em>Futureface: A Family Mystery, an Epic Quest, and the Secret to Belonging</em> by <strong>Alex Wagner,</strong> <em>Warlight</em> by <strong>Michael Ondaatje,</strong> <em>Feel Free</em> by <strong>Zadie Smith,</strong> and <em>Florida</em> by <strong>Lauren Groff.</strong> (Notably, Groff’s <em>Fates and Furies</em> also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/10/obama-favourite-book-of-2015-lauren-groff-fates-and-furies\">topped</a> Obama’s 2015 list.) He also included some of the nonfiction that intrigued political commentators like <strong>David Brooks</strong> and <strong>Ezra Klein</strong> this year: <em>Factfulness</em> by <strong>Hans Rosling,</strong> <em>How Democracies Die</em> by <strong>Steven Levitsky</strong> and <strong>Daniel Ziblatt,</strong> and <em>Why Liberalism Failed</em> by <strong>Patrick Deneen.</strong></p>\n<p>Obama’s film picks for the year are an equally versatile blend of blockbusters and indie projects: <em>Annihilation</em>, <em>Black Panther</em>, <em>BlacKkKlansman</em>, <em>Blindspotting</em>, <em>Burning</em>, <em>The Death of Stalin</em>, <em>Eighth Grade</em>, <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em>, <em>Leave No Trace</em>, <em>Minding the Gap</em>, <em>The Rider</em>, <em>Roma</em>, <em>Shoplifters</em>, <em>Support the Girls</em>, and <em>Won’t You Be My Neighbor?</em> He declined to weigh in on whether or not he believes it’s essential to watch <em>Roma</em> in a movie theater, or if it’s O.K. to simply stream it at home. He left one of the most raucously funny films of 2018, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/02/game-night-rachel-mcadams-review\"><em>Game Night</em></a>, off his list&#8212;but something tells us the Internet and <strong>Jesse Plemons</strong> will forgive him.</p>\n<p>But it’s the music portion of the list that showcases Obama’s increasingly strong “cool dad” persona like a pair of sensible, relaxed-fit jeans. Yes, there are the more expected song picks for any music aficionado&#8212;including “Make Me Feel” from <strong>Janelle Monáe’s</strong> <em>Dirty Computer</em> and “Apeshit” by The Carters. Cardi B’s infectiously joyous “I Like It” and Courtney Barnett’s “Need a Little Time” also made the list. And then there’s “One Trick Ponies” by Kurt Vile, “Wait by the River” by Lord Huron, and “Nina Cried Power” by Hozier. “And in honor of one of the great jazz singers of all time, who died this year,” Obama wrote as he closed his list, “a classic album: <em>The Great American Songbook</em> by Nancy Wilson.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8211; Is this the end of <a

Less than one week after her victory in the midterm elections, after all, A.O.C. had joined environmental activists in a protest in Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi’s</strong> office. Later, on a call with the progressive group Justice Democrats, she encouraged activists to support an effort to primary Democratic House incumbents. Then, during the first week of the 116th Congress, Ocasio-Cortez dropkicked leadership by taking a stand against the House rules package. Many Democratic caucus-goers wondered if she was more interested in building a grassroots movement or establishing her own political brand than passing collaborative legislation. As one congressional aide to a progressive House Democrat characterized it to me, “a cloud” hovered over Ocasio-Cortez after the elections.</p>\n<p>Months later, however, much of that skepticism has dissipated. Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides I spoke with over the past week see A.O.C. as a charismatic young lawmaker eager to learn the ropes and build relationships. The progressive aide, who has had multiple interactions with the freshman lawmaker, described her as having “an incredible Obama-esque factor” when connecting with people but surprisingly lacking an ego. The first congressional aide echoed the sentiment. “She has a willingness to work with people and develop positive relationships, and I think we should let her do her job for a little while and wait to determine if she is going to be a flamethrower or someone who will do more and do something real,” this person told me. “I think there are other members that can be more of a pain than A.O.C.”</p>\n<p>Notably, some suggested, Ocasio-Cortez has accrued praise by handling herself admirably in the face of criticism, which has occasionally been laced with overt sexism&#8212;such as <em>Washington Examiner</em> reporter <strong>Eddie Scarry’s</strong> widely criticized tweet that her wardrobe betrayed her socialist street cred. (“I think a lot of members think that she is probably being treated unfairly,” another congressional aide told me.) Sources I spoke with said Democrats were also encouraged by comments from A.O.C. that suggested she was backing away from threats to primary more centrist colleagues. (“I’m focused on my job,” she <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/11/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-democrats-establisment-1093728\">told</a> Politico.) Moreover, others have been impressed by her swift mastery of procedure. Late last year, <strong>Elijah Cummings,</strong> chairman of the House Oversight Committee, specifically requested that A.O.C. be tapped to serve on said committee, hoping that she would ask the questions no one else was. “A lot of people said that she might not be a team player, and I have found it to be just the opposite,” he told me. “She has been a breath of fresh air.”</p>\n<p>Cummings acknowledged the disruptive nature of the new Congress; the freshman class will at times be at odds with other members of the Democratic caucus. Congresswoman <strong>Rashida Tlaib</strong> of Michigan launched a 24-hour news cycle when she declared she wanted to “impeach the motherfucker,” in reference to Trump. Tlaib and <strong>Ilhan Omar</strong> of Minnesota have also stoked controversy with their criticism of Israel&#8212;notably putting them at odds with some Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on which Omar sits. Just last week, Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib, Omar, and Congresswoman <strong>Ayanna Pressley,</strong> another freshman, signed a letter calling on the bipartisan conference committee negotiating a border security deal to cut, not increase, funding for the Department of Homeland Security and, specifically, the ICE and C.P.B. agencies&#8212;a move certain to complicate the negotiation effort.</p>\n<p>But Cummings suggested that disagreement within the ranks is a considerable strength. “It is important that you have people like her&#8212;not only on my committee, but in the Congress&#8212;to remind folks of who we are, who we are as the Democratic Party, and who we have been for many years,” he explained. “And so, sure, when you do that like Ms. Cortez, you may ruffle a few feathers, but I think that, in the end, it will make us a better and stronger party.”</p>\n<p>Last week, during a House Oversight Committee hearing on the cost of prescription drugs, the freshman congresswoman presented as measured and methodical as she probed the relationship between drug manufacturers and taxpayer-backed organizations like the National Institutes of Health. “She asked the best set of questions of anybody in her five minutes,” Cummings said, noting that the New York congresswoman stayed for the entire hearing, which stretched beyond the five-hour mark. “It was clear that she had done her homework.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>After years of Republican infighting on Capitol Hill, Trump allies have seized on this new, disruptive era in progressive politics as evidence that the Democratic Party, too, is in disarray. Right-wing media has eagerly latched on to these policy divisions, casting A.O.C. as the ringleader of a band of insurgents. Democrats I spoke with, however, argued that there have always been progressives and centrists under the party banner. Others pointed to the unified messaging around the shutdown as evidence that these tensions were overblown. “Maybe right-wing media is so sick of their Freedom Caucus thwarting everything they want to do that they finally want to create that sentiment here. I just don’t think it is going to happen,” the first congressional aide told me.</p>\n<p>The freshman class is under no delusion that there is a one-size-fits-all approach to promoting progressive policy. “Every member of the freshman class has their own politics and their own experience,” an aide to a freshman lawmaker told me. But, they added, “there is tremendous kinship and excitement about this class. I honestly don’t give too much credence to the narrative around divisions.”</p>\n<p>Underlying the various narratives surrounding A.O.C. and other members of the Democratic freshman class is a recognition of their power. <strong>Steve Doocy,</strong> <strong>Ainsley Earhardt,</strong> and <strong>Brian Kilmeade</strong> wouldn’t waste airtime attacking her, Tlaib, and Omar if they didn’t recognize that these women are threats to the ideology they seek to promote every morning. It is not unlike how the Republican Party has spent billions of dollars disparaging Pelosi, whose skills as a master legislator were on full display during the shutdown. (Two sources suggested to me that Pelosi likely sees herself in Ocasio-Cortez.)</p>\n<p>A.O.C. and her fellow progressives have already had an indelible impact on the national political discourse, despite only being in office a few weeks. Since Ocasio-Cortez floated a 70 percent marginal tax rate on income over $10 million during a <em>60 Minutes</em> interview, the proposal has emerged as a talking point for potential 2020 hopefuls. According to one recent poll, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/425422-a-majority-of-americans-support-raising-the-top-tax-rate-to-70\">59 percent</a> of registered American voters support the plan&#8212;including 45 percent of Republicans. Similarly, while A.O.C.’s bold yet publicly undefined Green New Deal initially drew criticism and caused some turmoil within the Democratic Party, it has quickly emerged as something of a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-green-new-deal-a-green-new-deal-whatever-it-is-2020-democrats-support-it/2019/01/30/a75166d4-2340-11e9-ad53-824486280311_story.html\">progressive litmus test</a> for the Democratic field. “She is a Democrat and she is a strong, vocal advocate for our agenda,” the third congressional aide told me. “I think while initially fearful&#8212;and maybe even right to be fearful because of some of the early things that were going on&#8212;she has now come into her own and realized that she has a lot of power.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"House Democrats","socialTitle":"How A.O.C.

But Biden has other ideas.","body":"<p>Word of <strong>Barack Obama’s</strong> mid-November meeting with <strong>Beto O’Rourke</strong> cheered the millions of O’Rourke fans who want the Texas congressman to run for president in 2020. And it delighted the political pundit-verse, which is always hungry for new gossip and intrigue. <strong>Joe Biden,</strong> however, is said to have been less than thrilled. Obamaworld insiders describe the former vice president as upset&#8212;not specifically by Obama’s conversation with O’Rourke, but by the former president’s willingness to talk to other plausible Democratic contenders while Biden is still deciding whether to run himself. “This is unequivocally false. Period,” Biden spokesman <strong>Bill Russo says.</strong> So just how does Biden feel about his ex-boss chatting with potential primary rivals? “I’m not going to comment further,” Russo replies.</p>\n<p>Obama has nothing against Biden&#8212;in fact, he still loves Amtrak Joe, according to a person familiar with the ex-president’s thinking. And Obama has been strict about not publicizing who has sounded him out. But he does not want to repeat what he considers a mistake from 2016, when the Democratic establishment wrapped its arms around <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> as the party’s nominee early in the process. “He contrasts that with 2008, when he came out of the primaries and he’d been to all 50 states and he was fucking ready to take on John McCain,” one former Obama advisor says. “So his position this time is, ‘If you’re serious and you want to talk, I’ll talk to you.’ As things unfold, he might say, ‘Let’s all stay focused.’ But he’s not going to pick a winner.”</p>\n<p>Obama’s current wide-open approach must feel painfully ironic to Biden: four years ago he was one of the prospective candidates being pressured to stand down in favor of Clinton. In August, 2015, not long after the death of Biden’s 46-year-old son, Beau, and with talk escalating that Biden might jump into the race, Obama’s longtime senior political advisor, <strong>David Axelrod,</strong> went on the <em>Today</em> show to say he would advise against a Biden run. “I know what it takes to put a presidential campaign together, and it is late in the game,” Axelrod said, sending an unmistakable message. “Secretary Clinton, for all her problems, some of them self-inflicted, still has a very high rating among Democrats, and that of course is what determines who the nominee will be, and a big head start.” Now a CNN poll of Iowa shows Biden far ahead of second place <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong>&#8212;yet Biden isn’t being given the same deference.</p>\n<p>“If the institutional players had limited their time and advice to a couple of handpicked candidates in 2006 and 2007, Obama wouldn’t have had an opportunity to move forward,” says <strong>John Del Cecato,</strong> a Democratic strategist who began advising then-Illinois state senator Obama in 2004, and who worked on both of Obama’s successful presidential campaigns. “I know President Obama has tremendous respect for Biden. But he also appreciates the dark-horse candidates, or those who haven’t been as plugged in.” Obama’s experience also shapes his view that a long haul of contested primaries ultimately produces a sharper general election candidate. “When we lost New Hampshire in 2008 and we were all so depressed, Obama was very zen about the whole thing,” Del Cecato says. “Not that he wanted to be set back on his heels, but it’s one thing to have campaigned successfully in a couple of places. He thinks the nomination is something that should be earned.”</p>\n<p>Biden is 76, and he has been a national political figure since 1973. With the party’s momentum moving toward younger, non-white, female, more liberal candidates, one top Democratic strategist believes Biden is actually better off with Obama talking to other presidential aspirants now. “If I were Biden, I wouldn’t want to be in a situation where Obama is saying, ‘Look, you’ve got to be for my VP.’ Democrats don’t like to be told who to vote for,” the consultant says. “Many people lined up behind Sanders in 2016 because they didn’t want to be told to support Hillary. Biden doesn’t want to fall into that trap, to have Obama embrace him too exclusively, too early.”</p>\n<p>A second strategist, who works for a likely Democratic contender, understands why Obama’s flirtations may sting Biden’s ego. But this strategist doesn’t believe the former president will end up having much real influence on who emerges from the crowded 2020 field. “If Obama is playing footsie with people now, it creates tension,” the advisor says. “And it gets you some media attention and maybe some staffing. But actual voters? Obama himself has always been popular with Democrats, but I’ve never seen his popularity be transferrable to someone else.” Don’t kid yourself, though: Biden, and all the others, would love any wink, nod, or blessing Obama might bestow.</p>","rubric":"2020","socialTitle":"Obama Has Flirted with Beto, and Biden Is Not Happy","socialDescription":"The former president wants to avoid the mistakes of 2016, when the field was cleared for Hillary.

but one of <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> most shocking claims about a southern border wall has proven a bit exaggerated. The president claimed in Friday’s bizarre Rose Garden presser that several of his predecessors “have told me that we should have” built a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, though he declined to name which former presidents supported it. Perhaps unsurprisingly, representatives for the Bush family and <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> have denied the allegation.</p>\n<p>“This should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me, and they all know it,” Trump said. “Some of them have told me that we should have done it.”</p>\n<p>Clinton spokesperson <strong>Angel Ureña</strong> explicitly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/04/trump-former-presidents-border-wall-1082562\">refuted</a> the president’s assertion, adding that the two men have “not talked since the inauguration.” Bush representative <strong>Freddy Ford</strong> said the wall has never been discussed between the two. Former president George H.W. Bush <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/george-hw-bush-dead-at-94\">died in November</a>, though it is seen as unlikely that he and Trump had any significant discussion of a wall. Trump has famously kept his distance from the Bush family in the wake of past comments and a 2016 presidential campaign rivalry with <strong>Jeb Bush.</strong> Trump did not attend the funeral of former First Lady Barbara Bush in April.</p>\n<p>That just leaves former presidents <strong>Barack Obama</strong> and <strong>Jimmy Carter,</strong> both of whom have criticized Trump’s positions on immigration. An Obama spokesperson reportedly declined comment, though Obama himself has come out against the wall on numerous occasions. Carter, like Obama, has pushed for technological advancements to strengthen U.S. border security, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/trump-wall-shutdown.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, but not the kind of wall that Trump is seeking $5 billion to build. A senior administration official reportedly suggested that Trump was “referring to public comments his predecessors have made about the need for border security, not necessarily for a wall specifically.”</p>","rubric":"Wall Tales","socialTitle":"Former Presidents Deny Supporting Border Wall, Despite Trump Claims","socialDescription":"Neither Bush nor Clinton ever shared Trump’s desire

All four major broadcast networks, as well as Fox News, Fox Business, MSNBC, PBS, and CNN, will air the address&#8212;which, in some cases, will involve bumping programming. <em>Black-ish, The Gifted, FBI, Splitting Up Together,</em> and <em>Ellen’s Game of Games</em> will <a href=\"https://www.tvguide.com/news/president-trump-address-tuesday-fbi-blackish/\">all have to wait</a> for the president to finish his speech, in which he will likely stoke immigration fears with racist rhetoric and false or misleading statements.</p>\n<p>Trump announced the speech on Twitter Monday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1082347305699889157\">writing</a>, “I am pleased to inform you that I will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border.” The speech will begin at 9 P.M., and Trump is also expected to travel to the border on Thursday. CBS told <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/424258-democrats-demand-air-time-to-counter-trumps-border-speech\"><em>The Hill</em></a> that the White House said the speech would last a maximum of eight minutes.</p>\n<p>For a few hours on Monday, networks <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/07/media/networks-trump-border-security-speech/index.html\">wrung their hands</a> over whether to air the speech&#8212;but before long, CBS acquiesced to the president’s request, with the rest soon following suit. Critics have already slammed the networks for caving to Trump, worrying that viewers could walk away from his speech believing untrue statements&#8212;and sullying an immigration debate that’s already been poisoned by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/07/trump-administrations-misleading-spin-immigration-crime-terrorism/\">lies, exaggerations, and false narratives</a>. As <strong>Mika Brzezinski</strong> <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/morning-joe-says-networks-should-not-broadcast-trump-primetime-address-stream-of-lies/\">put it</a> on Tuesday’s <em>Morning Joe,</em> “The networks should refuse to turn over the airwaves to Donald Trump tonight for what they know objectively to be a steady stream of lies. Maybe that will stop him from debasing yet another one of our historic, solemn, and cherished presidential traditions.”</p>\n<p>Many more are grating at the apparent hypocrisy inherent in the networks’ decision to run the speech in the first place. As <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/7/18172419/trump-immigration-speech-networks-obama\">Vox</a> notes, <strong>George W. Bush</strong> was given airtime for his own immigration speech in 2006&#8212;but when <strong>Barack Obama</strong> planned to give his own speech on the same subject in 2014, the major broadcast networks chose not to air it. Obama pointed out that Bush’s speech had aired; networks countered that it had been a bipartisan address, while Obama’s intended address&#8212;which announced a series of executive actions on immigration&#8212;was “an overtly political move by the White House,” as Politico’s Playbook wrote at the time. Ultimately, big broadcast networks did not air it. As Vox points out, Trump’s speech is certain to be “overtly political” as well.</p>\n<p>So, why give Trump this platform? Perhaps it’s because, as CNN’s <strong>Brian Stelter</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/07/media/networks-trump-border-security-speech/index.html\">noted Monday</a>, Obama never made a formal request for airtime&#8212;but Trump reportedly did.</p>\n<p>“When the president of the United States asks for airtime, you’ve got to do it,” veteran anchor <strong>Ted Koppel</strong> told <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/trump-address-border-visit.html\"><em>The New York Times,</em></a> adding that he believes the networks should give Trump the benefit of the doubt. “If what he has to say is clearly just in his self-interest and does not address the greater national interest, then the next time the White House comes around, I might not be inclined to offer it.”</p>\n<p>In response to Trump’s announcement, House Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> and Senate Minority Leader <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> issued a joint statement in which they argued for equal time to respond to the president’s speech, writing, “Now that the television networks have decided to air the President’s address, which if his past statements are any indication will be full of malice and misinformation, Democrats must immediately be given equal airtime.” But as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/01/08/this-president-lies-daily-critics-demand-networks-fact-check-trumps-live-immigration-speech/\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> points out, the fairness doctrine was repealed in 1987&#8212;meaning it’s up to networks themselves to decide whether to grant Democrats time to respond on air. According to <em>The Hill,</em> Fox News, Fox Business, NBC, CBS, ABC, and CNN all intend to do so.</p>\n<p><em>This post has been updated.</em></p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Don’t call it a Dernaissance, call it <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/laura-dern-cover-story?inline\">Laura Dern’s much-deserved close-up</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Ethan Hawke gets candid about the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/ethan-hawke-kevin-spacey-harvey-weinstein-little-gold-men-interview?inline\">Weinsteins and Spaceys of the world</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; “I have a little bit of control over my destiny” <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/nicole-kidman-destroyer-big-little-lies?inline\">&#8212;Nicole Kidman</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Harrowing tales from the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/st-barths-yacht-season-pippa-middleton-jared-leto-les-moonves?inline\">St. Barth’s Yacht Convention</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The year ahead in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/the-year-ahead-in-royals-2019?inline\">British royalty</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hollywood newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Trump Broadcast","socialTitle":"Networks Will Air Trump’s Surely Inflammatory Immigration Speech . . .

href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/12/michelle-obama-book-tour-at-barclays-center\">follow-up visit</a> for her national book tour. Speaking with <strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong> onstage, Obama seemingly took inspiration from the stylish star and seriously stepped up her shoe game, wearing a pair of glittery thigh-high, $4,000 <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6514751/Michelle-Obama-dresses-impress-4-000-glittery-thigh-high-Balenciaga-boots-yellow-gown.html\">Balenciaga boots</a> paired with a yellow Balenciaga wrap dress.</p>\n<p>Obama has always been careful about her fashion choices, from these Balenciaga boots to the sensible J. Crew cardigans she often wore as First Lady. “I did know that my clothes were making a statement, I knew that was the case,” she told Parker on Wednesday, reflecting on her time in the White House. “So we decided why don’t we use this platform to uplift some young new designers who normally wouldn’t get this kind of attention, because you can change their lives, which is one of the reasons why we <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/01/michelle-obama-jason-wu-inauguration-dress\">chose Jason Wu</a> for my inaugural gown.”</p>\n<p>Though she has been gone from the White House for nearly two years, Obama is still very much in the spotlight, even sometimes unintentionally sharing it with <strong>Melania Trump.</strong> Last week, she visited Children’s Hospital Colorado on the same day that Trump visited Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C.; naturally, their two visits, where they both read to and visited children, were compared in news coverage. While Trump’s recent <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/melania-trump-says-she-does-what-i-think-is-right-despite-facing-criticism-from-the-public-media\">Fox News interview</a> followed her around the day of the hospital visit, Obama’s day was celebrated as if she had never left the White House at all. And that was nothing compared to the fervor that met <strong>Barack Obama</strong> when he made his <a

But they desperately fear another Barack Obama.","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Don’t kid yourself: President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> could absolutely win re-election. The old man is preternaturally intuitive, resilient when most would wilt, and just plain lucky. Plus, just as Ferris Bueller drove Ed Rooney insane, Trump has a knack for goading his political opponents to self-destruct. But, as I like to caution Republicans, you never know what might happen in 2020 if the Democratic Party nominates a presidential candidate who is likable, trustworthy, and . . . not under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>\n<p>Perhaps that is why, as Republicans sift through the wreckage of another Trump meltdown, the demolition of their House majority in the midterm elections two months prior, the ouster of <strong>James Mattis,</strong> and a holiday shutdown over the border wall, party operatives were spending the most wonderful time of the year trying to figure out what it’s going to take to avoid an even worse fate. For as much as some Republicans would like to see the president return to Trump Tower, they’re not willing to give up the presidency. And so, as the 2020 primary season begins, they are beginning to make a list of Democratic candidates that they think Trump can credibly beat.</p>\n<p>Without naming names, I asked several senior Republican insiders which Democrat, or Democrats, at the top of the opposition ticket would most reassure them about 2020. Without exception, <strong>Elizabeth Warren,</strong> the 69-year-old progressive senator from Massachusetts, topped every wish list. “There’s a lot of <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> in her,” said a veteran Republican operative in D.C. who hails from the Midwest and keeps a close eye on the heartland. “She’s elitist and doesn’t appear very nimble. It would be hard for her to expand her base or reach directly into Trump’s base.” Close behind were Senators <strong>Cory Booker</strong> of New Jersey and <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> of Vermont, who, technically, is not a member of the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>There’s a theme here. For all of Trump’s faults&#8212;and Republicans who make a living trying to win elections tend to be honest about most of them, albeit privately&#8212;the United States is still a center-right country, at least according to the data the G.O.P. trusts. And Trump brings a certain gravitas to the job, despite his periodic tendency to diminish the presidency. A lightweight Democratic contender too enthralled with, or captive to, leftist dogma is an opponent that even a politically pockmarked Trump can exploit.</p>\n<p>To wit, Trump’s domestic populism, fraught with cultural nativism such as it is, looks far more reasonable when stacked against dubious promises of free stuff (actually financed by the taxpayers, so, not free.) Trump’s “America First” nationalism, fraught with a troubling pullback from the post&#8211;World War II, bipartisan foreign policy consensus and disregard for America’s unique role as global protector of the liberal world order such as it is, looks less drastic when stacked against . . . a Democrat who essentially wants to do the same thing, minus the military buildup&#8212;and the tweets.</p>\n<p>But more than all of that, Republicans are happy to run against any progressive who tries to compete with Trump on Trump’s terms. Exchanging barbs on social media platforms; name-calling; questioning his capacity mentally, physically, and the like. As much as the Democratic base might be clamoring for a standard bearer to force-feed the president a dose of his own medicine, there is no beating the genuine article at the game he perfected. Trump is too quick and too shameless, and that approach offers little change to voters who want to turn the page from the chaos and anxiety that has characterized the current era. “A Democrat is not going to defeat Trump by being more brash, blustering, and strident. They will win over voters they need to retake the ‘blue wall’ states by connecting with those voters on substance but presenting an alternative to his leadership style,” a Republican consultant told me in an e-mail.</p>\n<p>Indeed, if there’s a key aspect to the fear <strong>Beto O’Rourke</strong> inspires in some Republicans, it’s the outgoing Texas congressman’s combination of sunny disposition and 21st-century social media agility. Sure, he’s unabashedly progressive, but to borrow a phrase from Vice President <strong>Mike Pence</strong>: He’s not angry about it. Nor, as it happens, does O’Rourke look down upon so-called heretics, or, if you prefer, “deplorables.”</p>\n<p>Ignore the Beto mockery prevalent in Republican circles during O’Rourke’s near upset of Senator <strong>Ted Cruz</strong> this past November. Party insiders were taking notes, and taking the 46-year-old from El Paso far more seriously than suggested by the apparent delight they took in lampooning everything about a figure who has drawn comparisons to a onetime up-and-coming Democrat named of <strong>Barack Obama.</strong> “A Democrat who can carry Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, or North Carolina is problematic,” a Republican insider from a critical swing state said. “Someone like Beto, who can campaign on the fly, raise money, and excite young voters, could put those and other states in play.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>The midterms marked a turning point in the Republican Party’s confidence in the president. During most of Trump’s time in the Oval, his job approval rating has been remarkably stable, poor but not disastrously so, averaging in the low 40s. Throughout, the president has skated from scandal to scandal, any one of which would have hobbled past administrations. As last month’s elections approached, this dynamic, reinforced by the stability of a Republican majority in the U.S. Senate that ultimately expanded by two seats, created a false sense of security about the health of the G.O.P. among many Republicans, even those less than thrilled with Trump.</p>\n<p>November 6 provoked a brutal reassessment. Republicans saw their coalition crack, and many senior strategists blame the president. As a few well-placed strategists told me for reporting I did for the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/house-republicans-clash-over-trumps-role-in-downfall-look-to-2020\"><em>Washington Examiner</em></a>, after-action polling and analysis made it clear that Trump drove away soft Republicans, college-educated Republicans, female Republicans, moderate Republicans, basically every category of Republican not firmly ensconced in Trump’s base, plus crucial independents, handing House Democrats a larger victory than most had predicted, and with it, the majority. The right Democratic presidential nominee could capitalize on that.</p>\n<p>And who is that? As often as Warren and her like-styled cohorts were mentioned as easy Trump foils, former Vice President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> was cited as among the few Democrats who many Republicans believe might dispatch the incumbent with relative ease. Is Biden progressive? Absolutely. Gaffe-prone? Duh. But he is the antithesis of Trump, with the added benefit that he’s been vetted before, and passed muster. “He wreaks calmness and normalcy, which I feel like people crave over the chaos of the Trump administration,” a Republican strategist headquartered in the Southwest said. Another Democrat who fits that bill, more than one Republican volunteered to me, unprompted: <strong>John Hickenlooper,</strong> the 66-year-old outgoing two-term governor of Colorado, former Denver mayor, and small-business owner. “One of the main disasters to avoid is to think 2016 is like 2020,” the Republican strategist based in the Southwest explained. “Trump got lucky and people held their nose against Clinton. That’s not likely to happen this time.”</p>\n<p>The problem for Republicans, lamented a seasoned G.O.P. hand in Washington, is that despite the challenges the Democrats face heading into the next election&#8212;a crowded and divisive primary and a restless base not necessarily uninterested in nominating calm, competent, and normal&#8212;“is that the Trump apologists won’t put the blame where it belongs and are burying their heads in the sand.”</p>\n<p>Of course, countless other Democrats are expected to run for president. Republicans continue to assess the developing field of candidates, many of who either remain an enigma or who engender differences of opinion as to how they would measure up against Trump. For instance, some dismiss Senator <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> of California as another radical progressive who isn’t ready for Prime Time, even if she’s right out of central casting for Democratic presidential contenders. Others see in her a shrewd operator who could realistically win the nomination and put Trump on defense the same way House Democrats put House Republicans in a bind in the midterm elections.</p>\n<p>It’s much the same for <strong>Michael Bloomberg,</strong> the billionaire media mogul and former mayor of New York City. Here’s a politician with a large enough personal fortune to outspend Trump and the Republican National Committee put together, and the wiliness to overcome his shortcomings. But some Republicans are unimpressed, saying there are few Democrats as polarizing and sure to keep the G.O.P. coalition together the way Clinton did two years ago as would the crusading anti-soda, anti-gun Bloomberg.</p>\n<p>Then there are those Republican power brokers who, amid fretting about what might happen down ticket in 2020, neither fear the formidable Democrats nor welcome the weaklings. “Fear is an interesting word because I fucking hate Trump so much,” a Republican consigliere said. “I certainly wouldn’t be sorry to see him lose.”</p>\n<p><em>David M.

He went full dragon energy <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/even-trumps-closest-republican-allies-cant-stomach-syria-decision\">in December</a> after Trump abruptly announced that he was withdrawing nearly all U.S. troops from the war-torn region (“If <strong>[Barack] Obama</strong> had done this, all of us would be going nuts because it’s such a bad idea,” he told <strong>Mike Pence</strong>), and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Emma_Dumain/status/1075760112508329987\">promised</a> to tweet at Trump every time the president mentioned Syria (“I’m not letting this go”). Unfortunately, recent events have forced Graham to take more dramatic action to get the president’s attention, such as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/20/inside-patrick-shanahans-clash-with-congress-munich-over-syria/?utm_term=.a91455067823\">describing in detail</a> to <em>The Washington Post</em> how he impressed upon Acting Defense Secretary <strong>Patrick Shanahan</strong> his fervent belief that withdrawing from Syria is “the dumbest f---ing idea” he’s ever heard.</p>\n<p>The dramatic scene reportedly unfolded last Saturday at the Munich Security Conference, where several members of the U.S. congressional delegation privately confronted Shanahan about the administration’s plans. A day earlier, Graham <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/02/15/exclusive-lindsey-graham-pitches-syria-safe-zone-to-prevent-isis-reemergence/\">told Breitbart</a>, he had personally pitched Trump on establishing a Syria “safe zone” along the border with Turkey, which would allow a percentage of U.S. troops to remain in the region as a deterrent against ISIS, joining forces with European and Kurdish allies to monitor the area. Apparently he figured he’d made inroads with the president. But when he heard about Shanahan suggesting to European allies that Trump is preparing to withdraw <em>all</em> U.S. troops from Syria, Graham exploded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Are you telling our allies that we are going to go to zero by April 30?” he asked Shanahan, according to Graham.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Yes, that’s been our direction [from the president],” Shanahan replied.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“That’s the dumbest f---ing idea I’ve ever heard,” Graham responded.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Graham then launched into a list of consequences he feared would result from a precipitous U.S. withdrawal from Syria without a follow-up plan: the Islamic State would return, Turkey would attack Kurdish forces, Iran would gain the advantage. Graham asked Shanahan if he disagreed with that analysis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“That could very well happen,” Shanahan said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Well, if the policy is going to be that we are leaving by April 30, I am now your adversary, not your friend,” Graham told the acting Pentagon chief, according to Graham. (Several other lawmakers confirmed this exchange.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After a “deer in the headlights” response, Shanahan reportedly pinned the dumb f---ing idea on his dumb boss. (Or, as the <em>Post</em> put it, “he failed to articulate a substantive response&#8212;other than to re-iterate these were Trump’s instructions.”) “Shanahan did not have a good meeting,” said Democratic Senator <strong>Sheldon Whitehouse.</strong> Fellow Democrat <strong>Bob Menendez</strong> fumed that the Trump administration was not listening to a bipartisan opposition. “[Shanahan] got a chorus of voices that basically said, ‘This is not going to work, there is a bipartisan resolve not to let this happen, and you need to send a message back to the president that there’s a combined, unified view this is not the way to go and he should change course,’” Menendez said. “[Shanahan] basically said he got the message.”</p>\n<p>Should the Shanahan intervention move the administration’s needle on Syria, perhaps persuading Trump to join a coalition of the willing to establish a safe zone, Graham would like it known that he had something to do with it. “After Iraq, not only would this be a mistake, this would be almost an unpardonable sin, in the sense that you know what can happen. This can risk his whole presidency,” Graham told the <em>Post,</em> now offering Trump the carrot. “Now, if he adjusts his policies and he does what Obama didn’t do and he holds this together, he’ll be looked at as the guy who finally got it right.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a

But the theatricality with which he tells it may be his greatest vulnerability.","body":"<p>One word pops up quickly and prominently nearly every time <strong>Cory Booker</strong> speaks publicly. “I will continue to try to be as fearlessly authentic as I can,” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/us/politics/cory-booker-2020.html\">he told <em>The New York Times</em></a> during a visit to New Hampshire in early December. “Every candidate should run on their authentic self,” Booker <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/news/cory-booker-presidency-single-man-20181214.html\">told the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em></a> later that month. A Booker ally uses the same word to describe the New Jersey senator to me: “His real, deep, authentic connection to the city of Newark informs a lot of what he’s done in D.C.”</p>\n<p><strong>Cornell Belcher</strong> laughs. The Democratic pollster believes the repetitive choice of adjective is no coincidence. “I think perhaps some of that’s been poll-tested or comes from focus groups,” he says. Which would only be due diligence, in preparation for Booker, 49, making his decision official in the next several weeks. The Booker team is certainly savvy enough to have picked up the whispering by some of his possible competitors for the 2020 presidential nomination, using a line of attack that’s been wielded against Booker for years: “I hate the word ‘authenticity,’” one rival strategist says. “But he seems so hammed up.”</p>\n<p>Booker’s first crucial test would come in South Carolina’s primary, where black voters make up the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/21/cory-booker-bernie-sanders-2020-south-carolina-1116639\">majority</a> of the Democratic electorate. Voters there are more socially conservative than black voters in many other states, and the most efficient way to connect with them is through churches. So Booker’s first 2019 trip to an early-primary state was to South Carolina, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, for an appearance at Zion Baptist Church in the state capital, Columbia. <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> was there too, but Booker was promoted as the main attraction. “<strong>Barack Obama’s</strong> ability to break through with African-American voters in 2008 wasn’t simply around issues,” says Belcher, who worked for that campaign. “It was also around values, and what he represented. Remember the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/16/us/politics/16obama.html\">fatherhood responsibility speech</a> that he did? A lot of the chattering class elites had a bit of a problem with it. You know who didn’t have a problem with it? Those churchgoing black women in South Carolina who, every Sunday, that’s a conversation in their churches.”</p>\n<p>Obama demolished <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> in South Carolina by a 29-point margin, generating momentum that propelled him into a strong Super Tuesday showing. The context for Booker will be very different&#8212;in part because President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> looms over everything, but also because the South Carolina Democratic primary has never before included two black contenders. He would be going up against his good friend from the Senate, <strong>Kamala Harris.</strong> His strengths include the breadth of his life experience&#8212;Booker was a star student and football player who studied at Stanford and Oxford and Yale, but continually worked with low-income kids and moved to a Newark housing project before successfully running to become that city’s mayor in 2006. Booker would be the first former Democratic mayor of a major city to run for president since Cleveland’s <strong>Dennis Kucinich</strong> in 2008, providing a powerful voice for urban issues at a time when big cities are underrepresented in the national political process and discussion. Booker still lives in hardscrabble Newark, a decision his camp says was never a stunt&#8212;that it gave him a genuine understanding of working-class issues when he was mayor, and that it would distinguish him from the rest of the field if he runs for president.</p>\n<p>Booker, never married, would lack one key element that helped Obama sell himself on a human level in South Carolina: an exemplary wife and kids. His greatest weakness, though, may be the theatricality with which he expresses his experiences and opinions, a style that can produce compelling rhetoric, but one that also opens him up to skepticism that his actions are indeed stunts. In September, during the <strong>Brett Kavanaugh</strong> confirmation hearings, Booker declared, “This is about the closest I’ll probably ever have in my life to an ‘I am Spartacus’ moment,” as he <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/405345-booker-releases-confidential-kavanaugh-documents\">released</a> supposedly confidential documents. Unfortunately for Booker, the documents had already been released the night before, and did not back up Booker’s claims about Kavanaugh and racial profiling. “People may view some of the things he does as flashy, but they are effective and genuine,” the Booker ally says. “He’s a product of two parents who were active in the civil-rights movement, and he’s been seeking creative ways to elevate the causes he believes in for a long time. He also talks about love and unity of purpose in politics in a way that distinguishes him from many Democrats.” No less an authority on black churches and political performance than the Reverend <strong>Al Sharpton</strong> vouches for Booker’s abilities. “I’ve seen Cory mesmerize church audiences,” Sharpton says. “I don’t see that as a problem.”</p>\n<p>Other candidates will also be competing hard to win the support of black voters in South Carolina&#8212;<strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> stopped by for a rally on Wednesday&#8212;and demographics guarantee Booker and Harris nothing. Which doesn’t mean, of course, that they won’t try to turn that commonality into an advantage, and that they won’t inevitably fight over the same voters. Harris has been heavily emphasizing the fact that she attended the historically black Howard University, and on Friday she will speak at a charity event hosted by a chapter of her college sorority&#8212;in Columbia, South Carolina. Booker’s campaign would try to draw a contrast between his street-level empathy and Harris’s years as a prosecutor. “It would be wrong to think that just because you’re black, the African-American electorate is going to rally around you,” Belcher says. “If that were true, Barack Obama wouldn’t have been losing to Hillary Clinton by 20 or 30 points before we put in a plan. Every campaign has to find its lane. Kamala, and Booker, if he runs, are going to have to work to win over the audience of African-American voters. They are central to anyone becoming the nominee. And if you cannot come in first or second place in South Carolina, you cannot be the Democratic nominee.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The family drama surrounding <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/biden-2020-front-runner-family-divorce-drama?inline\">Joe Biden’s presidential bid</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; What to make of the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/buzzfeed-mueller-saga-veteran-journalists-circumspect-confused?inline\">BuzzFeed-Mueller mystery</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; A happy ending for one <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/fyre-festival-caterer-gofundme-maryann-rolle?inline\">Fyre Festival contractor</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Intrigue in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jesse-angelo-abruptly-exits-the-new-york-post-murdoch?inline\">Murdoch-land</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Yes, <em>Schitt’s Creek</em> really is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/yes-schitts-creek-really-is-that-good?inline\">that good</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"2020","socialTitle":"“He Seems So Hammed Up”: Cory Booker Battles an Authenticity Problem","socialDescription":"The former Newark mayor can tell a compelling story about urban issues and his own background.

On Tuesday, <strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong> did just that as he welcomed <strong>Michelle Obama</strong> back to <em>The Tonight Show</em>&#8212;to the great delight of many guests at 30 Rock. The gambit? Very simple: stand outside the elevators and wait.</p>\n<p>As the doors opened, multiple tour groups at NBC’s headquarters were treated to the surprise of a lifetime: Fallon and Michelle Obama, waiting to be glimpsed by them. One group saw the pair sitting in armchairs, casually reading one another’s books. Another saw the two playing around with a piano. Yet another saw Obama jumping rope. Regardless of what Obama was doing, the reaction was always the same: gleeful screams.</p>\n<p>This is not the first time Obama and Fallon have teamed up for a heartwarming prank. Last year, as the Obamas departed the White House, Fallon invited guests to record farewell messages for Michelle&#8212;but did not inform them that the First Lady was listening to their heartfelt words from behind a screen. The reactions were about as <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/michelle-obama-tonight-show\">emotional</a> as you’d expect. In fact, the idea was such a success that Fallon later repeated it with guests including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expKmfdoo28\"><strong>Chadwick Boseman</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/04/tina-fey-surprise-mean-girls-fans-jimmy-fallon-tonight-show\"><strong>Tina Fey</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this is the kind of late-night fare we could use more of. After all, gleeful videos of celebrity pranks and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/cardi-b-carpool-karaoke-james-corden-late-late-show\">senior-center concerts</a> make a pretty

recalls the leaking, the gossiping, and the infighting that made Kellyanne Conway such a formidable player in the White House.","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>The inner circle of Trumpworld was not always a pretty picture. Too often, it was a portrait of venality, stubbornness, and selfishness. We leaked. We schemed. We backstabbed. Some of us told ourselves it was all done in the service of a higher calling&#8212;to protect the president, to deliver for the people. But usually it was for ourselves. Most of us came to Washington convinced of the justice of our cause and the righteousness of our principles, certain that our moral compasses were true. But proximity to power changes that. <strong>Donald Trump</strong> changes that. The once-clear lines&#8212;between right and wrong, good and evil, light and darkness&#8212;were eroded, until only a faint wrinkle remained.</p>\n<p>A particular case in point involves <strong>Kellyanne Conway,</strong> who had the title of Trump’s 2016 campaign manager. (Though it was really <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> if anyone, who was actually in charge.) As counselor to the president, Kellyanne managed to land a job with no fixed responsibilities. “What exactly does Kellyanne do?” was a question people asked all the time. So she was able to continue being the president’s pit bull on TV&#8212;a job that never goes out of fashion in Trumpworld&#8212;and otherwise just dabble in areas that piqued her interest. She would later focus her efforts on the opioid crisis and veterans’ issues, but early on she was content&#8212;very content&#8212;to sit back, go on TV, and let rivals eat one another alive. And she was predictably resentful of both <strong>Ivanka</strong> and Jar­ed’s immovable status in Trump’s orbit.</p>\n<p>As I watched Kellyanne in operation over our time in the White House, my view of her sharpened. It became hard to look long at her without getting the sense that she was a cartoon villain brought to life. Her agenda&#8212;which was her survival over all others, including the president&#8212;became more and more transparent. Once you figured that out, everything about her seemed so calculated; every statement, even a seemingly innocuous one, seemed poll-tested by a focus group that existed inside her mind. She seemed to be peren­nially cloaked in an invisible fur coat, casting an all-­knowing smile, as if she’d collected 98 Dalmatians with only 3 more to go.</p>\n<p>I’m not sure the president ever fully understood that about Kellyanne. But what he clearly shared with her was a love of media attention. Unlike most human beings, Trump’s greatest fear wasn’t death or failure or loss. It was obscurity. If he was noticed, he mattered. And he didn’t care much if the attention was good or bad, as long as it wasn’t indifferent. Mentions in the press had long been his oxygen. Another Page Six scoop, another breath. A <em>Time</em> magazine cover, a shot of adrenaline. He spent his adult life keeping the brand going, whatever it took. He couldn’t just own a nice hotel, but the most beautiful hotel ever built. He couldn’t just have a difficult divorce, but the most sensational ever to hit the tabloids. He couldn’t just have a popular TV show; it had to be the most highly rated in history. He couldn’t be a good president; he’d have to be as great&#8212;greater, even&#8212;than Lincoln.</p>\n<p>Trump sincerely held most members of the media in low regard&#8212;that wasn’t just for show. But what he didn’t like to admit was that he also craved their ap­proval. And nothing was more a focus of his attention in this regard than <em>The New York Times.</em> It was his hometown paper, after all. During a dinner with evan­gelical leaders in the Blue Room, Trump named the exact number of occa­sions he had been on the front page of the <em>Times</em> during his career as a businessman. It was only a handful. “Now, I’m on there almost every day,” he observed, though usually not in the way he would have liked. He added, with a mix of pride and irritation, that Ivanka, who was also in the room, still got better coverage in the <em>Times</em> than he did.</p>\n<p>Like many presidents, he was obsessed with White House staffers who leaked against him&#8212;and was always on a quest to figure out a way to unmask them. On one memorable occasion, the president got a prominent White House reporter on the phone who had written a story that quoted anonymous staff members. “Who gave you this story?” Trump asked playfully. “I’d just be curious to know who told you this.”</p>\n<p>The reporter laughed somewhat nervously, saying they obviously could not reveal their sources. Leaning over the phone in the Oval Office, arms crossed in front of him with his elbows sitting on the Resolute Desk, Trump tried to cut a deal. “Well, I guess that’s fine,” he replied. “But, of course, you know I could give you so much better stories&#8212;so much better.” After a little more unsuccessful coaxing, Trump relented. The reporter hung up without a hot scoop from “a source close to the president.”</p>\n<p>His somewhat-playful attempted bribe was unsuccessful that day, but Trump never halted his effort to uncover the leakers in his midst. It was also a favorite parlor game among staff in the West Wing to guess who the unnamed White House officials were in various stories. But one day, by sheer accident, I didn’t have to guess anymore.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>In May 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/business/media/kellyanne-conway-joe-mika.html\">hosts of MSNBC’s <em>Morning Joe</em> appeared on-air</a> to accuse Kellyanne of being two­-faced when it came to Donald Trump. <strong>Mika Brzezinski</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/business/media/mika-joe-kellyanne-conway.html?module=inline\">claimed</a> that when Kellyanne came on their show during the campaign, she would lavish Trump with praise, and then “the camera would be turned off, the microphone would be taken off, and she would say, ‘Blech, I need to take a shower,’ because she disliked her candidate so much.” <strong>Joe Scarborough</strong> asserted that Kellyanne had only taken the Trump gig because it would pay off finan­cially. And they both said they had decided to no longer book her on the show because she lacked credibility.</p>\n<p>Kellyanne had developed pretty thick skin, and normally she would let this kind of stuff go. So I was a little surprised when she called me upstairs to her office to discuss issuing a response. I assumed this was because she feared Trump would believe the charges, which might threaten her plum White House position of doing whatever it was she wanted whenever she felt like it.</p>\n<p>Kellyanne’s office was one of the largest in the West Wing. On the top floor, above <strong>Steve Bannon</strong> and Kushner’s offices below, it was about twice as long as it was wide. On the south end of the room, where her desk sat, she had the most valuable commodity in the West Wing: two fairly large, square exter­nal windows. On the opposite end of the room, she had a small conference table that could comfortably seat six. In between, there was a sitting area with a couch and two chairs positioned on opposite sides of an oval coffee table. The office had been set up this same way when <strong>Valerie Jarrett</strong> occupied it during the Obama years. Just outside her door, in a tiny reception area, sat her executive assistant, who handled her calendar, and her body man, who shadowed her every move and catered to her needs.</p>\n<p>I had not brought my work laptop upstairs with me when she called, so Kellyanne pointed over to her personal MacBook sitting on the conference table on the other side of the room. “Just use that and type something up for me,” she said.</p>\n<p>I sat down and started slowly pecking out a statement. While working in the White House, I found that I’d grown so accustomed to writing in Trump’s voice that writing for other people had become somewhat harder than it nor­mally would have been. I was already getting off to a slow start, but I was also getting distracted by the nonstop stream of iMessages popping up on the screen. At that point, personal phones had not yet been banned in the West Wing, so Kellyanne was sitting at her desk texting away. And since her iMes­sage account was tied to both her phone and her laptop, which she must not have even considered, I could inadvertently see every conversation she was having.</p>\n<p>Over the course of 20 minutes or so, she was having simultaneous conversations with no fewer than a half­-dozen reporters, most of them from outlets the White House frequently trashed for publishing “fake news.” Jour­nalists from <em>The New York Times,</em> <em>The Washington Post,</em> CNN, Politico, and Bloomberg were all popping up on the screen. And these weren’t policy conversations, or attempts to fend off attacks on the president. As I sat there trying to type, she bashed Jared Kushner, <strong>Reince Priebus,</strong> Steve Bannon, and <strong>Sean Spicer,</strong> all by name. (“The real leakers, past and present, get much more positive press than I do. While it’s rare, I prefer to knife people from the front, so they see it coming,” Conway said in a statement shortly after publication. According to a source familiar with the situation, the statement was drafted in consultation with her husband, George Conway. Subsequently, George Conway has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1088277015122325504\">denied involvement</a> with the statement on Twitter. A White House aide close to Kellyanne Conway insisted that George Conway was not involved in this statement, but did contribute to the statement submitted to <em>Morning Joe</em>. )</p>\n<p>She also recounted private conversations she’d had with the president, during which, at least in her telling, she’d convinced him to see things her way, which she said was a challenge when you’re deal­ing with someone so unpredictable and unrestrained. She wasn’t totally trashing the president, at least as the <em>Morning Joe</em> crew described it, but she definitely wasn’t painting him in the most favorable light. She was talking about him like a child she had to set straight. I was sitting there, watching this, totally bewildered. I was supposed to be writing a statement, defending her against accusations that she had done almost exactly what I was watch­ing her do that very moment.</p>\n<p>When <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> co-host <strong>Abby Huntsman</strong> later <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/02/kellyanne-conway-number-one-leaker-494436\">asked Kellyanne about allegations</a> that she was the “No. 1 leaker” in the administration, she sidestepped the question, only saying that “leakers get great press,” and adding that “one day, Abby, I will have my say.”</p>\n<p>From what I saw on her computer, she was having her say all day long. Kellyanne was playing a double game&#8212;putting a foot in both worlds&#8212;telling Trump and his supporters on Fox one thing, while bad-­mouthing them to the “main­stream” media in private. It didn’t hurt matters with the latter group that her husband, <strong>George,</strong> was an increasingly frequent critic of the president on Twit­ter. If the Trump administration was the <em>Titanic,</em> as many outsiders routinely claimed, then Kellyanne seemed determined to play the role of the Unsink­able Molly Brown. She wasn’t going to go down with this ship.</p>\n<p>I suspect that posterity will look back on this bizarre time in history as if we were living in the pages of a Dickens novel. <em>It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.</em> Some of us on both sides of that blurry divide were young, wide-eyed, and seeing the real world for the first time. Others were battle-weary, watching with great cynicism the twisting of the American experiment. Those of us who were there were part of a unique moment in time when the greatest nation on earth wrestled with its better angels and its nagging demons. We will hold tight to the triumphs, lose sleep over the failures, and perhaps shed tears over what could have been. Some of us will be proud of what we did. Others will be ashamed and never speak of it again. Some will remember this as the best work we ever did.

Zuckerberg and <strong>Sheryl Sandberg</strong> have insisted that episodes such as Cambridge Analytica’s hijacking of Facebook data constitute <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/4/5/17200918/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-data-privacy\">“abuse”</a> of its system. But according to British lawmakers, Facebook brass has responded in “bad faith” to such issues, and should be held “at arms’ length” by governments. “It seems clear to us that Facebook acts only when serious breaches become public,” the committee’s report read. “Companies like Facebook should not be allowed to behave like ‘digital gangsters’ in the online world, considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law.”</p>\n<p>In a separate statement, D.C.M.S.C. chair <strong>Damian Collins</strong> took Zuckerberg to task in particular for “continually fail[ing] to show the levels of leadership and personal responsibility that should be expected from someone who sits at the top of one of the world’s biggest companies.” He added that “evidence uncovered by my committee shows he still has questions to answer yet he’s continued to duck them, refusing to respond to our invitations directly or sending representatives who don&#39;t have the right information.”</p>\n<p>Though much of the report focused on Facebook, it also included regulatory recommendations for social-media platforms in general, including that they be required to adhere to a code of ethics; that they be monitored by an independent U.K. regulator; and that regulators should investigate Facebook for anti-competitive practices. In response, <strong>Karim Palant,</strong> Facebook’s U.K. public-policy manager, said in a statement that the company is “open to meaningful regulation and support[s] the committee’s recommendation for electoral law reform. We also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users.”</p>\n<p>Whether Facebook will ultimately be held to these standards is unclear. Despite its <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/facebook-posts-record-profit-despite-scandals\">endless parade of scandals</a> and negative press, the company has somehow continued to prosper, gaining both revenue and users last year.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/15/politics/sarah-sanders-robert-mueller/index.html\">reported</a> that White House Press Secretary <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> has been interviewed by <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> team, raising questions about whether <strong>Donald Trump</strong> may have directed her to lie. According to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/15/special-counsel-mueller-interviewed-trump-press-secretary-sarah-huckabee-sanders.html\">NBC News</a>, the interview took place in the fall of 2018, around the time former Chief of Staff <strong>John Kelly</strong> was interviewed. “The president urged me, like he has everyone in the administration, to fully cooperate with the special counsel. I was happy to voluntarily sit down with them,” Sanders told CNN in a statement.</p>\n<p>Presumably at issue is a 2017 statement by <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong> denying reports that he met with Russian officials in Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign, with the intention of obtaining damaging information about <strong>Hillary Clinton.</strong> Though Donny initially claimed to have crafted the statement without the input of the president, later reports&#8212;complete with e-mails&#8212;suggested Trump Senior played a major role. At the time, Sanders defended the president, saying, “The statement that Don Jr. issued is true,” and that the president “weighed in as any father would, based on the limited information that he had.”</p>\n<p>Legal experts scrying the news coming out of the Mueller probe suggested that Sanders may have been interviewed to establish a pattern of Trump directing subordinates to lie on his behalf. “If Trump directed Sanders to lie to the public, that would show consciousness of guilt even though lying to the public in and of itself is usually not a crime,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/renato_mariotti/status/1096506788537610240\">suggested</a> CNN legal analyst <strong>Renato Mariotti.</strong> Since 2017, it has been reported that Mueller is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/special-counsel-is-investigating-trump-for-possible-obstruction-of-justice/2017/06/14/9ce02506-5131-11e7-b064-828ba60fbb98_story.html\">investigating possible obstruction of justice</a> by the president. Sanders, who has been serving in the White House since the beginning of the Trump administration, and who has been present at several critical junctures of the presidency, could be a critical witness.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

But when it comes to the federal contractors who also went unpaid during that period&#8212;up to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/13/18223471/back-pay-federal-contractors-shutdown\">580,000 people</a>, according to one estimate&#8212;it gets trickier. “I’ve been told the president won’t sign” anything that guarantees them back pay, Senator <strong>Roy Blunt</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-blocking-contractor-back-pay-gov-t-funding-deal-lawmaker-n971226\">told reporters</a> on Wednesday. “I guess federal contractors are different in his view than federal employees.”</p>\n<p>On the 2016 campaign trail, it was a well-known (but ultimately overlooked) fact that Trump <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-business-plan-left-a-trail-of-unpaid-bills-1465504454\">routinely refused to pay contractors</a> during his career as a businessman. But the idea of paying these contractors reportedly had bipartisan support, until <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> shot it down. A legislative source <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/429827-push-to-include-contractor-back-pay-in-funding-deal-hits-gop-roadblock\">told</a> the Hill that the administrative cost alone to pay back the contractors would be as high as the back pay itself, and that previous shutdown negotiations did not include this provision. “That was not initially part of our deal,” Senator <strong>Richard Shelby</strong> explained. “I personally would rather keep it narrow in scope.”</p>\n<p>Other Republicans, such as <strong>John Cornyn,</strong> seemed to take joy in turning contractor pain to political gain. “<strong>[Nancy] Pelosi</strong> and <strong>[Chuck] Schumer</strong> should have thought about this and other collateral damage when they initially refused to negotiate on border security, something they are apparently now willing to do,” he told NBC News. “Thousands of federal contractors have not been reimbursed from the 35-day shutdown,” Schumer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1095770911196831744\">said</a> in response to these reports. “This issue is hanging in the balance. . . .

between <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> and <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> has been extra prickly of late, following McConnell’s campaign to jam through as many of <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> judicial nominees as possible, and a shutdown impasse that left the former bruised and the latter fuming. And now, it seems Schumer is out for blood: according to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/12/schumer-amy-mcgrath-1167184\">Politico</a>, last month the Senate minority leader and members of the D.S.C.C. met with <strong>Amy McGrath,</strong> an ex-fighter pilot and a Democratic candidate in the midterms, to pitch her on running against the Senate majority leader in 2020. McGrath, who ran in Kentucky’s 6th District, reportedly “listened and didn’t rule it out.” An aide confirmed the meeting had taken place, but said McGrath wouldn’t rush to a decision: “The military officer in her always approaches these things pretty methodically and thoughtfully,” the aide said.</p>\n<p>Though she was ultimately defeated by Republican <strong>Andy Barr</strong> in the midterms, her performance may be enough to give McConnell pause: she lost by just <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/kentucky-house-district-6\">3.2 points</a> in a predominantly white conservative district, after famously <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/us/politics/andy-barr-amy-mcgrath-kentucky.html\">beating the establishment pick</a> in the primary. Her video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcjG2fK7kNk\">ad</a>, in which she describes her career as a Marine and a fighter pilot, quickly went viral, earning her bipartisan kudos in a deep red state.</p>\n<p>But allies of McConnell, who has a reputation for three-dimensional strategy, told Politico they were not concerned about the majority leader’s chances, citing his deep ties to the donor class across the country and his $4 million campaign war chest. “The brilliance of McConnell’s campaigns are that they are comprised of a complex orchestra of political instruments brought together for a symphony of absolute destruction,” said adviser <strong>Josh Holmes.</strong> “His opponents may hear a note or two before they decide to run, but he saves the full composition to ensure it’s the last thing a candidate hears before they enter the political graveyard.”</p>\n<p>Laudatory prose aside, McConnell has held his seat since 1984, and his last serious challenger, <strong>Alison Lundergan Grimes,</strong> lost by double digits in 2014. Trump won Kentucky <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/kentucky\">handily</a> in 2016, winning 62.5 percent to <strong>Hillary Clinton’s</strong> 32.7 percent. And McConnell has reportedly had his eye on McGrath since long before Schumer and co. fell in line behind her&#8212;per Politico, his team began compiling an opposition binder on McGrath in early 2017, which has involved combing through “years of video footage.” McConnell has also hired a 2020 campaign manager, <strong>Kevin Golden,</strong> who led Representative <strong>Marsha Blackburn’s</strong> Senate campaign in 2018. And a pro-McConnell PAC is poised to meet this week to lay out an anti-McGrath strategy. If she does opt to run in 2020, McGrath will be forced to endure the full McConnell treatment, “symphony of absolute destruction” and all.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity

I have high expectations for the people that work for me. But I have high expectations for this country.”</p>\n<p>The remarks came days after both <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-klobuchar-abuse-staff-2020_us_5c5a1cb1e4b0871047588649\">HuffPost</a> and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mollyhensleyclancy/amy-klobuchar-staff-2020-election\">BuzzFeed News</a> reported that at least three people had withdrawn from consideration to lead her White House bid&#8212;and that former Senate Minority Leader <strong>Harry Reid</strong> had previously <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-klobuchar-mistreat-staff-harry-reid_us_5c5db1ece4b03afe8d674530\">pushed</a> her to “change her behavior” in response to multiple complaints from aides. “It’s hard to explain the anxiety that permeates the office,” a former staffer told BuzzFeed. “It’s an overwhelming sense of panic.” Klobuchar’s camp countered with a statement proclaiming she “loves her staff” and “is proud of them and the work they have done,” but the reports last week generated a wave of bad press just as she formally joined the crowded field of Democratic 2020 hopefuls.</p>\n<p>It remains to be seen how the accusations will impact her young candidacy. Former staffers’ claims that Klobuchar was verbally abusive and “habitually demeaning” may help explain why she has among the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-2020-election.html\">highest staff turnover rates</a> of any senator from 2001&#8211;2016. That could undercut her popular image on Capitol Hill, create problems within her campaign, and raise concerns among voters. “When you have people who don’t want to work for you, you can’t be as effective,” one former staffer told HuffPost.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the horrible-boss horror stories may not stick. In those same reports, several ex-staffers also praised Klobuchar&#8212;and even suggested that criticism reflected a sexist double standard. “I’ve heard people say she’s tough to work for, and I sometimes cringe when I hear it, because I rarely hear that said about male bosses in Congress, despite the fact that half of Congress is tough to work for,” former legislative aide <strong>Tristan Brown</strong> told HuffPost.</p>\n<p>In framing the claims as pushing her staff hard in pursuit of high expectations, she may even turn the allegations into an asset. Statistically, Klobuchar is one of the most productive lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In leaning into the tough-boss persona, she may be positioning herself to pitch “high expectations” as a selling point to voters looking for a tough contender to square off against Trump. “Her job wasn’t to be my mentor and cheerleader,” an ex-staffer told BuzzFeed last week. “Her job was to get shit done for Minnesota.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The

In addition to this crusading news coverage, the <em>Times</em>’s opinion section has published a number of critical takes of its own. “Facebook Cannot Be Trusted to Regulate Itself,” the editorial board <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/opinion/facebook-data-congress-russia-election.html\">declared</a> on November 18. More recently, on Tuesday, the section published a <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/online/ny-times-torches-facebook-with-brutal-anniversary-video-heres-to-another-15-years-of-privacy-invasion/\">video</a> tied to Facebook’s 15th anniversary in which it mocked the company’s history of blunders and P.R. crises.</p>\n<p>The close scrutiny from America’s paper of record was enough for Facebook sources to <a href=\"https://link.nbcnews.com/view/57c09634487ccd31218b61289aeq1.4kf/8a499dc1\">anonymously vent</a> to NBC’s <strong>Dylan Byers</strong> about what they see as “overtly antagonistic coverage that betrays an anti-Facebook bias.” (“The stories grew organically from the controversies surrounding Facebook and elections,” <em>Times</em> executive editor <strong>Dean Baquet</strong> told Byers, calling Facebook “a big company with unusual power that finds itself in the middle of some of the largest issues of the day&#8212;privacy and political meddling.”)</p>\n<p>Now, it appears that two <em>Times</em> reporters will be digging even deeper into Facebook’s troubles&#8212;and getting paid considerably for it. I’m told that publishing insiders are buzzing about a deal that <strong>Sheera Frenkel</strong> and <strong>Cecilia Kang</strong> have landed for a book based on their Facebook reporting for the <em>Times.</em> According to sources familiar with the matter, HarperCollins was the winning bidder in a competitive auction to acquire a title based on a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html\">November 14 <em>Times</em> investigation</a>, headlined “Delay, Deny, and Deflect,” on which Frenkel and Kang were two of the five bylines. One source briefed on the negotiations said it was a seven-figure deal. <strong>Adam Eaglin</strong> and <strong>Elyse Cheney</strong> sold the book, which will be edited for the Harper imprint by executive editor and S.V.P. <strong>Jennifer Barth.</strong> Reached for comment, a HarperCollins spokesperson confirmed the publisher had won North American rights to the as yet untitled book.</p>\n<p>The seven-digit advance is yet more evidence that the market for books by prominent reporters on the political and social upheaval of our current era is superheated. Most of these books have a distinct Trump angle, and, Frenkel and Kang’s won&#39;t be an exception. Their <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html\">reporting</a> on Facebook for the <em>Times</em> explored Trump’s personal Facebook activity and Russia’s manipulation of the social network during the 2016 campaigns, as well as Facebook’s involvement with Cambridge Analytica, now notorious for its close ties to Trump.</p>\n<h3>More Great

As co-founder and president <strong>Roy Schwartz</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/axios-the-fast-twitch-media-darling-is-celebrating-its-second-anniversary\">told me</a> last week, “We are beta testing. We started last year. It’s a high-end, high-dollar product. I can’t really talk more about it for competitive reasons, but that’s my main focus for 2019.”</p>\n<p>Now Axios has found the person who will lead that effort on the tech side. The influential Web site and e-mail-newsletter factory has hired <strong>Jess Szmajda</strong> as its new chief technology officer. The 38-year-old, who joins from the e-commerce-oriented start-up Optoro, will oversee Axios’s existing 23-person tech team while also recruiting for a handful of new positions as the company gears up for the launch of its subscription product. She succeeds <strong>Matt Boggie,</strong> who left Axios back in September. “Jess was the clear choice and comes to us after months of interviewing some of the best tech leaders in the industry,” said Axios co-founder and C.E.O. <strong>Jim VandeHei.</strong> “Jess operates with a people-first mentality and has a proven track record of building and scaling big teams.”</p>\n<p>Axios says it looked at the executive composition of more than 50 news companies, and none of them have a female C.T.O. Axios also says Szmajda will be the first female transgender C.T.O. of a notable media property. Szmajda, who transitioned in August 2017, hopes her hiring will be a step toward greater diversity within media corporate suites. “If you look at boardrooms and executive ranks, and even tech in general,” she told me, “there just isn’t much diversity. It’s all white heterosexual men, basically. People need to see people who look like them to understand there’s a path for their career.” She added: “As a transgender woman, I have seen both sides of the coin in terms of diversity and inclusion. I’ve seen how I was treated before I transitioned versus after. I kind of knew I had made it as a woman when people started talking over me in meetings.”</p>\n<p>In addition to Szmajda, Axios has hired <strong>Mike Berkley</strong> as its first chief product officer.

to support and defend.”","body":"<p>After <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/zuckerberg-stumbles-headfirst-into-apples-pr-buzz-saw\">cheering the Silicon Valley techlash</a> from the sidelines, Apple has found itself back in headlines for a scandal of its own. For the past week, the iPhone-maker has been under increasing pressure from human-rights advocates for its decision to host <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/%D8%A3%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1/id1004966456#?platform=iphone\">Absher</a>, a Saudi government-made app that allows men in the rigidly patriarchal country to monitor the travel of their wives and daughters. Now, with the outcry expanding to include top U.S. lawmakers, Apple C.E.O. <strong>Tim Cook</strong> has said the company will investigate the matter. “I haven’t heard about it,” Cook <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/02/12/693994447/apple-google-criticized-for-carrying-app-that-lets-saudi-men-track-their-wives?t=1550046501386\">told</a> NPR on Monday. “But obviously we’ll take a look at it if that’s the case.”</p>\n<p>Cook’s vow to “take a look” comes as both Apple and Google face a groundswell of scrutiny for carrying the app, which Senator <strong>Ron Wyden</strong> has called an “unconscionable” decision. “These companies shouldn’t enable these abusive practices against women in Saudi Arabia,” the Oregon Democrat <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1095031479636238337\">tweeted</a> this week. On Monday, he <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/absher-senator-ron-wyden-demands-apple-google-remove-saudi-govt-app-2019-2\">sent a letter</a> to Cook and Google C.E.O. <strong>Sundar Pichai</strong> arguing that the app “flies in the face of the type of society you both claim to support and defend.”</p>\n<p>“I ask that you take immediate action to prevent your technical infrastructure, including your app stores, from being used by the Saudi government to enable the abhorrent surveillance and control of women,” Wyden wrote. “Your employees and your customers expect better, as do millions and millions of Americans who support America’s promotion of basic rights and dignity around the world.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1095031479636238337\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1095031479636238337\">https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1095031479636238337</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Wyden is part of a growing chorus of voices calling for the companies to drop Absher, which has been reported on extensively by <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/absher-senator-ron-wyden-demands-apple-google-remove-saudi-govt-app-2019-2\">Business Insider</a>. “We call on Apple and Google to assess the risk of human rights abuses on women, which is facilitated by the App, and mitigate the harm that the App has on women,” Amnesty International <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/12/human-rights-groups-call-apple-google-review-saudi-app-that-can-restrict-womens-travel/\">said</a> in a statement to <em>The Washington Post</em> on Tuesday. According to the <em>Post,</em> the Absher platforms have more than 11 million users.</p>\n<p>The controversy has underscored concerns about the social responsibility of tech companies&#8212;and about their links to the Saudi kingdom, which has been under renewed scrutiny in recent months following the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/mike-pompeo-jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia\">killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/saudi-teen-fleeing-family-granted-asylum-in-canada/2019/01/11/2dcc701e-1595-11e9-90a8-136fa44b80ba_story.html\">escape of teenager <strong>Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun,</strong></a>, who was granted asylum in Canada last month and has criticized Saudi Arabia’s repression of women. Both Apple and Google have been slow to respond to the criticism of the app. Cook’s comments this week appear to be his first public remarks about it.

Is Sanders still necessary in a race full of imitators?","promoDek":"He lost the 2016 primary, but won the war of ideas. Is Sanders still necessary in a race full of imitators?","body":"<p><strong>Bernie Sanders,</strong> whose insurgent bid for the Democratic nomination came up short against <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> in 2016, is giving it another go. On Tuesday, the Independent senator from Vermont announced he will once again seek the presidency, joining a crowded cast of 2020 hopefuls. “Brothers and sisters, we have a lot of work in front of us,” Sanders said in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1097828878310096901\">campaign video</a> released Tuesday morning. “If we are prepared to stand together, there is no end to what the great people of our nation can accomplish.”</p>\n<p>In his announcement, Sanders played up the fact that policy positions he’s long championed&#8212;universal health care, income equality, free college tuition for all&#8212;have gained significant traction within the Democratic party, including among some of his fellow 2020 bidders. In an <a href=\"https://www.vpr.org/post/hes-2020-bernie-sanders-running-president-again#stream/0\">interview</a> with Vermont Public Radio on Tuesday morning, he also took direct aim at <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> suggestive of the more <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/bernie-vs-stacey-what-the-post-sotu-split-screen-means-for-democrats-in-2020\">confrontational approach</a> he’s signaled he’ll adopt in challenging the president: “I think the current occupant of the White House is an embarrassment to our country,” Sanders said. “I think he is a pathological liar . . . I also think he is a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, somebody who is gaining cheap political points by trying to pick on minorities, often undocumented immigrants.”</p>\n<p>Sanders, who has been rumored to be mulling another run for months, is almost certain to be a top-tier candidate out of the gate. His last race was as much of a challenge to the Washington establishment as it was a campaign against Clinton, and his message of economic populism has taken root within the party in the years since, sprouting up in both <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kirsten-gillibrand-2020-campaign\">mainstream Democratic figures</a> and the more <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-and-the-legacy-of-the-bernie-sanders-movement\">progressive newcomers</a> who have begun to push the party to the left.</p>\n<p>That leftward turn could make for a more favorable landscape for Sanders this time around, as he seeks the nomination from a party that’s become increasingly receptive to his ideas. On the other hand, the more his most transformative ideas become mainstream, the less necessary he may be. Several of his fellow candidates&#8212;particularly <strong><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-universal-child-care-proposal_n_5c688f3ae4b01757c36c2511?2vf\">Elizabeth Warren</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Sen-Kamala-Harris-says-she-s-no-democratic-13626081.php\">Kamala Harris</a></strong>&#8212;have positioned themselves as safer vessels for Sanders’s progressive stances, staking out similar positions on a number of issues, without the democratic-socialist label that could turn off moderates. Warren has pointedly described herself as a “capitalist,” despite announcing a radical plan to tax the rich. Harris, who has suggested that she would replace private insurance with Medicare for All, told voters in New Hampshire on Monday, “I am not a democratic socialist.”</p>\n<p>Sanders is also likely to face renewed scrutiny for his clumsy <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/02/politics/sanders-sexual-harassment-ac360-cnntv/index.html\">handling of sexual harassment allegations</a> against members of his 2016 campaign, and his sometimes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmurraypolitics/status/1088486008927211522\">tone-deaf</a> approach to race. At 77, he’s likely to face questions about his age; if he wins, he would be the oldest person ever elected president. As Vermont Public Radio’s <strong>Bob Kinzel</strong> put it in his interview with the senator on Tuesday, could he still be “the face of the new Democratic Party”?</p>\n<p>Sanders insists that he is, positioning himself as the godfather of the kind of progressivism that’s taken root within the party. Other members of that party might take issue with Sanders calling himself a Democrat. But, of course, Trump proved that voters are more than willing to take a bet on somebody with a credible claim to outsider status. And Sanders was raging against the Establishment long before it was fashionable.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Democrats 2020","socialTitle":"Bernie Sanders, the Original Lefty Radical, Faces an Army of Mini-Mes","socialDescription":"He lost the 2016 primary, but won the war of ideas.

Eleven years after a young <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> purchased an aging skyscraper that would become an albatross around his family’s neck, and six months before the Kushners would have to cough up the $1.4 billion that was due on the mortgage for 666 Fifth Avenue, a Canadian asset-management company <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/nyregion/kushners-building-fifth-avenue-brookfield-lease.html\">swooped in</a> and agreed to take a 99-year lease on the building, paying a near-century’s worth of rent upfront. The bailout was surprising for a few reasons, chief among them being comments by the Kushners’ previous partner that 666 Fifth “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/is-jared-kushner-the-worlds-worst-real-estate-investor\">would be worth a lot more if it was just dirt</a>,” plus the fact that the family had spent two years trying to get new partners or financing to no avail. Also, there was the matter of the Qatar Investment Authority being a major investor in the company, Brookfield Asset Management, and Kushner’s <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/jared-kushner-backed-qatar-blockade-after-qataris-wouldnt-finance-his-property-828847\">support of a Saudi- and U.A.E.-led blockade of Qatar</a>. To some, it sure <em>sounded</em> like a foreign government was trying to influence policy by greasing the president’s son-in-law’s wheels! At the time, Brookfield told reporters that the Qataris “had no knowledge of the deal before its public announcement”&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/nyregion/kushner-deal-qatar-666-5th.html\">apparently they don’t read <em>The New York Times</em></a>&#8212;and now that the deal has officially gone through, Doha is doubling down, insisting, somewhat curiously, that the government <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qatar-fund-kushner-insight/qatar-revamps-investment-strategy-after-kushner-building-bailout-idUSKCN1Q00W3\">had absolutely nothing to do with the 666 debacle</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When news emerged that Qatar may have unwittingly helped bail out a New York skyscraper owned by the family of Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, eyebrows were raised in Doha. . . . The bailout, in which Doha played no part and first learned about in the media, has prompted a rethink of how the gas-rich kingdom invests money abroad via its giant sovereign wealth fund, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The country has decided that the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) will aim to avoid putting money in funds or other investment vehicles it does not have full control over, according to the sources, who are familiar with the QIA’s strategy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Qatar started looking into how its name got involved into the deal and found out it was because of a fund it co-owned,” said one of the sources. “So QIA ultimately triggered a strategy revamp.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is it possible that Qatar truly had no knowledge of its role in doing a major solid for the Kushners just months before a make-or-break deadline? Sure, just like literally anything is possible. But many are suspicious!</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/jedshug/status/1095198659870945281\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jedshug/status/1095198659870945281\">https://twitter.com/jedshug/status/1095198659870945281</a></p></blockquote></div><div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/espiers/status/1095362087038140416\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/espiers/status/1095362087038140416\">https://twitter.com/espiers/status/1095362087038140416</a></p></blockquote></div><p>In addition to likely having had the chance to hear about the deal through Brookfield directly or read about it in the paper of record, one would imagine the Qataris were keeping tabs on all things Kushner on account of Jared’s father, <strong>Charles Kushner,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kushner-companies-confirms-meeting-with-qatar-on-financing/2018/03/18/55e281ac-1e3c-11e8-9de1-147dd2df3829_story.html\">taking a meeting</a> with Qatar’s finance minister, <strong>Ali Sharif Al Emadi</strong> in April 2017. (Kushner the Elder later said he accepted the invite purely “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/jared-kushners-dad-leave-my-boy-alone\">out of respect</a>” for the Qataris to tell them there was no way “we could do business.”) So why is Doha taking pains to insist it accidentally bailed out the First-in-Laws on their no good, very bad investment now?

When polling firm Bold Blue gave respondents the option to remain undecided, 48 percent took it. As a result, Biden ended up with only 12 percent support. Right behind him: California Senator <strong>Kamala Harris,</strong> with 11 percent. When an ABC News-<em>Washington Post</em> survey asked respondents to volunteer a name for the primary, Biden led the field with just 9 percent. Harris came in second again, with 8 percent.</p>\n<p>Those numbers might give Biden pause as he considers his evolving political calculus. (Sources close to Biden recently said he is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/biden-95-percent-ready-2020-run\">“95 percent”</a> ready to make his decision.) For someone who entered the national arena only two years ago, Harris has had an impressive trajectory since officially launching her presidential campaign in Oakland last month, placing her well ahead of high-profile rivals like <strong>Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren,</strong> and <strong>Cory Booker</strong> in the eyes of <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/430298-harris-off-to-best-start-among-dems-in-race-say-strategists-donors\">many Democratic strategists</a>. Harris famously brought in $1.5 million to her campaign PAC just 24 hours after she announced her run, thanks to a <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/kamala-harris-2020-launch-is-the-best-by-far\">digital fund-raising strategy</a> that one operative described as “overkill,” but resulted in <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/kamala-harriss-2020-launch-creates-nice-polling-buzz.html\">amazing press</a>. In an era when Democratic politics are drifting further to the left, and primary voters care more than ever about identity, Harris&#8212;young, black, progressive&#8212;looks like the future. Biden may have greater appeal to swing voters, but he also looks and sounds like the party’s past.</p>\n<p>Harris may benefit from other electoral assets, too. Traditionally, Iowa and New Hampshire had outsize importance in the Democratic primary, elevating candidates who can appeal to Midwestern whites and independent-minded New Englanders, respectively. Now that California has bumped up its primary date to Super Tuesday, Harris may have a huge, 475-delegate hometown advantage. “Our strategy runs straight through California, and we plan to aggressively defend our home-state turf from donors to political leadership to super-delegates to organizations and their underlying memberships,” senior strategist <strong>Sean Clegg</strong> recently told <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/16/kamala-harris-california-2020-strategy-1173320\">Politico</a>. “We believe the early primary, early voting, and the cost of communicating will make it virtually impossible for all but the top two or three candidates to play in the state in a meaningful way.”</p>\n<p>Polling numbers, obviously, don’t necessarily translate into long-term successes. But already, a potential Biden-Harris face-off looks like a microcosm of the debate that will likely run through the entire Democratic primary. Do Democrats win by nominating somebody fresher or more familiar? Biden and Harris clearly have their partisan diehards, but if the numbers from Bold Blue indicate anything, it’s that the two still have to make their case to nearly half the country&#8212;and there’s no telling if that half might ultimately prefer <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/john-mcafee-says-he-has-recruited-hundreds-of-masked-lookalikes-for-his-2020-presidential-campaign/\">somebody else</a> entirely.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"2020 Democratic Primary","socialTitle":"Would Kamala Crush Biden in a 2020 Cage Match?","socialDescription":"The former vice president holds the title of presumptive front-runner.
