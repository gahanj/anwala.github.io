The officials also shed light on the murky conditions surrounding ongoing family separations.</p> <p>Some of the most revealing testimony on Thursday came from Commander Jonathan White, a career public health official who helped oversee shelters for migrant children in 2017 and 2018 at the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which handles the care of migrant children under the umbrella of the Department of Health and Human Services.</p> <p class="article__pull-quote">"I do not believe separation of children from their parents is in the best interest of the child."</p><p>Even before then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions formally announced the zero tolerance policy in April, White told lawmakers that he wondered whether border officials were separating families because he was seeing an increase in migrant children sent to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. He said he approached his superiors, including then-director Scott Lloyd, about making a plan because he worried the agency wouldn’t have enough resources to handle a spike in detained children.</p> <p>“I was told family separation wasn’t going to happen,” White said. In fact, he said he learned of its existence only on T.V.</p> <p>“I do not believe separation of children from their parents is in the best interest of the child,” White added. “Neither I nor any career person in ORR would have ever recommended such a policy proposal.”</p>  Tracking and reuniting families <p>The lack of preparation showed immediately: The Office of Refugee Resettlement didn’t have a solid mechanism for tracking which of the children in its custody were unaccompanied and which had been taken from their parents, according to White. Shelters ran out of bed space and had to move unaccompanied minors to influx shelters to make room for the younger kids separated from their parents.</p> <p>The Office of Refugee Resettlement also had no way to reunite separated children with their parents, as a federal judge ordered in June. Officials had to sort, by hand, through the files of around 12,000 migrant children in its custody to see which children had been separated from their parents and where their parents were.</p> <p>Originally, around 2,700 children were ultimately identified as having been separated from their parents. But a January report from the inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services concluded the numbers might be higher — by the thousands — and it’s unclear how many have been reunited so far. In a court filing earlier this month, the Trump administration argued it could be “traumatic” to remove migrant children from their sponsors and return them to their parents. </p> <p>Jennifer Podkul, senior director of policy and advocacy at Kids in Need of Defense, which represented many of the separated children, recounted the story of the mother being given the wrong baby. She told the lawmakers on Thursday that the zero tolerance policy was a disaster from start to finish.</p> <p>“What we saw this administration do last summer was an attempt at deterrence, but in the most cruel way possible,” she said. “Our attorneys didn’t even know which children had been separated, let alone how to find the parents.”</p> <p>Most of the children came from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, all countries facing extraordinary violence and poverty.
