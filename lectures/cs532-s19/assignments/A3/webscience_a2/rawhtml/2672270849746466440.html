data-reactid="229">Heads spun Tuesday when __<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/donald-trump#intcid=dt-hot-link">Donald Trump</a>__decided that the best course for righting his campaign&#x2019;s sinking ship would be to <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/donald-trump-steve-bannon-kellyanne-conway">bring on alt-right newsman <strong>Stephen Bannon</strong></a> as chief executive. It was a decision that appeared to double down on some of the Trump&#x2019;s campaigns <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/breitbart-stephen-bannon-donald-trump-master-plan">most fringe elements</a> and self-destructive impulses&#x2014;which seem to be the reason the ship has been sinking in the first place&#x2014;leaving many wondering: Who thought this was a good idea?</p><p data-reactid="230">The answer, according to several reports, is the conservative, anti-establishment, aggressively anti-Clinton hedge-fund billionaire <strong>Robert Mercer,</strong> and his daughter <strong>Rebekah</strong>. The Mercers, who initially put $13.5 million into a PAC that supported <strong>Ted Cruz&#x2019;s</strong> presidential bid, <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/291772-billionaire-father-and-daughter-linked-to-trump-shakeup">reportedly</a> surprised their friends when they swung their support behind Trump after the Texas senator dropped out. According to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-08-17/trump-s-new-team-brings-deep-ties-to-major-donor">Bloomberg</a>, Rebekah met with <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/ivanka-trump#intcid=dt-hot-link">Ivanka Trump</a></strong> (the campaign&#x2019;s de facto First Lady ) and her husband, <strong>Jared Kusher</strong> (until yesterday, the campaign&#x2019;s de facto manager) earlier this year to win over her family&#x2019;s support.</p><!-- react-empty: 231 --><!-- react-empty: 232 --><!-- react-empty: 233 --><p data-reactid="234">By the time Cruz refused to endorse Trump onstage at the Republican National Convention, the notoriously private family released a statement in support of the billionaire developer that concluded, &#x201C;We need all hands on deck to ensure that Mr. Trump prevails.&#x201D;
For the Mercers, that apparently included bringing Bannon on board. Rebekah reportedly broached the topic with a downtrodden Trump at a Hamptons fund-raiser hosted by Jets owner <strong>Woody Johnson</strong> over the weekend, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/08/17/trump-reshuffles-staff-in-his-own-image/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>. The <em>Post</em> cites three sources who say that she confronted him about reports that his staffers were urging him to tone down his rhetoric and professionalize his campaign; he reportedly asked her how he could fill his inner circle with voices that more closely mirrored his own. That&#x2019;s when she brought up Bannon&#x2019;s name. By Sunday, the two were golfing together at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey. By Tuesday, it was announced that the Breitbart exec had the job.</p><p data-reactid="235">The Mercers&#x2019; ties to Bannon run deep. According to Bloomberg, the family first invested $10 million in Breitbart News in 2011, and later worked together to turn the book <em>Clinton Cash</em>&#x2014;a damning look at the Clinton&apos;s foundation&#x2014;into a Mercer-financed documentary. (Bloomberg noted that Mercer sent his 203-foot yacht to its premier at Cannes). Bannon also reportedly serves as an adviser to one of the family&#x2019;s advocacy groups in New York, which shares an address with Cambridge Analytica, a data firm in which the Mercers are investors. It just so happens that the Trump campaign recently decided to use the firm&#x2019;s services, according to <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/291772-billionaire-father-and-daughter-linked-to-trump-shakeup"><em>The Hill</em></a>, which cited the decision as another example of the Mercers&#x2019; influence within the Trump campaign.</p><p data-reactid="236">This kind of influence between wealthy donor and candidate is the exact sort of relationship for which Trump has slammed <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/hillary-clinton#intcid=dt-hot-link">Hillary Clinton</a></strong> in the past. But it makes sense that a New York billionaire so swayed by his own daughter would take a cue from another New York billionaire father-daughter political partnership.

be to <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/donald-trump-steve-bannon-kellyanne-conway\">bring on alt-right newsman <strong>Stephen Bannon</strong></a> as chief executive.

The Mercers, who initially put $13.5 million into a PAC that supported <strong>Ted Cruz&#x2019;s</strong> presidential bid, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/291772-billionaire-father-and-daughter-linked-to-trump-shakeup\">reportedly</a> surprised their friends when they swung their support behind Trump after the Texas senator dropped out. According to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-08-17/trump-s-new-team-brings-deep-ties-to-major-donor\">Bloomberg</a>, Rebekah met with <strong><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/people/ivanka-trump#intcid=dt-hot-link\">Ivanka Trump</a></strong> (the campaign&#x2019;s de facto First Lady ) and her husband, <strong>Jared Kusher</strong> (until yesterday, the campaign&#x2019;s de facto manager) earlier this year to win over her family&#x2019;s support.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>By the time Cruz refused to endorse Trump onstage at the Republican National Convention, the notoriously private family released a statement in support of the billionaire developer that concluded, &#x201C;We need all hands on deck to ensure that Mr. Trump prevails.&#x201D;\nFor the Mercers, that apparently included bringing Bannon on board. Rebekah reportedly broached the topic with a downtrodden Trump at a Hamptons fund-raiser hosted by Jets owner <strong>Woody Johnson</strong> over the weekend, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/08/17/trump-reshuffles-staff-in-his-own-image/\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>. The <em>Post</em> cites three sources who say that she confronted him about reports that his staffers were urging him to tone down his rhetoric and professionalize his campaign; he reportedly asked her how he could fill his inner circle with voices that more closely mirrored his own. That&#x2019;s when she brought up Bannon&#x2019;s name. By Sunday, the two were golfing together at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey.

According to Bloomberg, the family first invested $10 million in Breitbart News in 2011, and later worked together to turn the book <em>Clinton Cash</em>&#x2014;a damning look at the Clinton&apos;s foundation&#x2014;into a Mercer-financed documentary. (Bloomberg noted that Mercer sent his 203-foot yacht to its premier at Cannes). Bannon also reportedly serves as an adviser to one of the family&#x2019;s advocacy groups in New York, which shares an address with Cambridge Analytica, a data firm in which the Mercers are investors. It just so happens that the Trump campaign recently decided to use the firm&#x2019;s services, according to <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/291772-billionaire-father-and-daughter-linked-to-trump-shakeup\"><em>The Hill</em></a>, which cited the decision as another example of the Mercers&#x2019; influence within the Trump campaign.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>This kind of influence between wealthy donor and candidate is the exact sort of relationship for which Trump has slammed <strong><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/people/hillary-clinton#intcid=dt-hot-link\">Hillary Clinton</a></strong> in the past. But it makes sense that a New York billionaire so swayed by his own daughter would take a cue from another New York billionaire father-daughter political partnership. (Rebekah, according to <em>The Hill,</em> also happens to live in one of Trump&#x2019;s buildings, as Ivanka also does.)

There&#x2019;s probably a thousand dollars&#x2019; worth of stickers on that hat if you go through all the layers. I used to sell heavy equipment in the mining industry. It became [that] there was no return on my investment. I couldn&#x2019;t make any money because of the downturn in the coal-mining industry, so I&#x2019;m not doing that anymore.&#x201D;</div><div>Photograph by Justin

Asked by <strong>Abby Huntsman</strong> whether she had any concerns about the project, the senior White House adviser <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/08/politics/ivanka-trump-russia-investigation/index.html\">responded</a> that she knew “literally almost nothing” about a Trump Organization proposal to build a skyscraper in downtown Moscow, and said she had “zero concern” that anyone in her family could be implicated in <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> investigation into Russian efforts to fix the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Of course, Ivanka’s account differs somewhat from various reports suggesting she knew a great deal about the project. According to <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/mueller-eyes-ivanka-don-jr-s-work-trump-tower-moscow-003012099.html\">Yahoo News</a>, both she and <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong> were involved in the project as far back as 2013, and were aware that former Trump lawyer <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> had been working to revive the deal. In October 2015, Trump Sr. signed a letter of intent to move forward with negotiations, but has continued to be evasive about the extent of his ambitions. In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress about the scope of the Trump Tower project, and BuzzFeed News recently reported that the president directed Cohen to say that those negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did, though the special counsel’s office issued an unusual statement disputing the BuzzFeed story as “not accurate.”</p>\n<p>According to the contested BuzzFeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation\">report</a>, both Ivanka and Trump Jr. received “regular, detailed updates” about the project from Cohen. Ivanka would reportedly have managed a spa at the tower, and per BuzzFeed, instructed Cohen to speak with a Russian athlete who had “synergy on a government level” to move the project along. A spokesperson for the First Daughter’s attorney told BuzzFeed that she was only “minimally involved” in proceedings, and “did not know about this proposal until after a non-binding letter of intent had been signed.” Her older brother, meanwhile, has testified under oath that he was only “peripherally aware” of the plans.</p>\n<p>She contested the Yahoo report too, insisting that her involvement in the project was limited to recommending an architect. But in her interview with Huntsman, she offered additional explanations: the Moscow deal was one of many she was juggling, she was too busy to have paid much attention, and it never moved beyond a theoretical stage. “There was never a binding contract,” she told Huntsman during the <em>Good Morning America</em> interview, part of which aired Friday. “I never talked to the&#8212;with a third party outside of the organization about it. It was one of&#8212;I mean, we could have had 40 or 50 deals like that, that were floating around, that somebody was looking at. Nobody visited it to see if it was worth our time. So this was not exactly like an advanced project.”</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing there, yet it’s created weeks and weeks and months of headlines,” she added. “So no, I have zero concern.”</p>\n<h3>More

Both lived on the same block on the Upper East Side. More notably, both were crucial supporting players in the Trump orbit. Cohen had been an indefatigable booster of <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> helping to arrange his real-estate deals, paying off alleged mistresses, and quashing would-be damaging stories regarding his boss. Wolkoff, for a time, was a lesser-known, but equally diligent enforcer for <strong>Melania Trump.</strong></p>\n<p>The two women had met years earlier, when Wolkoff helped produce the Metropolitan Museum’s Costume Institute Benefit. (<strong>Anna Wintour,</strong> who hosts the gala, is editor-in-chief of <em>Vogue</em> and the artistic director of Condé Nast, <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s parent company.) Over the years, Wolkoff would become a member of Melania’s small inner circle. After Trump’s surprise electoral-college victory, she went on to help the First Lady in Washington, serving as a senior adviser to her official governmental office on matters large and small. Wolkoff helped facilitate Melania’s transition to the White House, and advised her on policy platforms, East Wing décor, and her overall messaging.</p>\n<p>The two were close enough that Wolkoff could openly express divergent views. According to sources familiar with the conversations, Wolkoff told Melania and East Wing staffers that the name for her anti-bullying initiative, “Be Best,” sounded illiterate. (The First Lady, according to these sources, feared that an alternative, “Children First,” was too similar to her husband’s “America First” branding.) They also disagreed about the infamous “I Really Don’t Care, Do U?” jacket that the First Lady wore to the U.S.-Mexico border. (Melania, according to these sources, thought the trip would not get attention without such a brazen fashion gesture. In an interview with ABC News in October, she said that she wore the jacket for the media and people who were criticizing her, and wondered aloud whether the trip would have received similar attention without it.) But the two women remained close, nevertheless. On trips to D.C., Wolkoff would sometimes spend the night in the White House residence; other times, she would book a room in the Trump International Hotel down Pennsylvania Avenue. According to e-mail exchanges from the time, she was given the friends and family rate of $345 a night, and told to submit receipts to <strong>Reince Priebus.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/c97a4730-bc95-4032-b21a-a970764c038c?customColor=%23ff0000\"><iframe height=\"220\" width=\"750\" src=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/c97a4730-bc95-4032-b21a-a970764c038c?customColor=%23ff0000\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong><em>iTunes user?

Cohen, of course, went from being one of the president’s closest confidants to one of his most bitter and dangerous adversaries. Wolkoff’s separation was less public, but is increasingly newsworthy. Through her company, WIS Media Partners, Wolkoff oversaw Trump’s sprawling week-long inaugural festivities&#8212;she sourced and managed third-party vendors, entertainers, and broadcasters, and oversaw the themes and production of all the concerts, dinners, balls, and programming. She worked in close proximity to the Trump family and inaugural chair <strong>Tom Barrack,</strong> a billionaire private-equity real-estate investor who had been a close friend of the president for years. And yet a year after the swearing-in ceremony, Wolkoff left the White House amid an uncomfortable public-relations crisis regarding the president’s inaugural committee.</p>\n<p>Last February, <em>The New York Times</em> published an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/politics/trumps-inaugural-committee-paid-26-million-to-first-ladys-friend.html\">article</a> centered on WIS, headlined “Trump’s Inaugural Committee Paid $26 million to Firm of First Lady’s Adviser.” The inaugural committee had raised a stunning $107 million&#8212;about twice what <strong>Barack Obama</strong> had hauled in 2009&#8212;from donors such as <strong>Sheldon Adelson</strong> and corporations like AT&amp;T. But as the <em>Times</em> reported, the tax form revealed profligate spending&#8212;nearly $10 million on travel; $4.6 million on salaries and benefits; and $100,000 to <strong>Rick Gates,</strong> the former campaign aide and deputy chairman of the inauguration who, about a week later, became one of <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> first major cooperating witnesses. Some $40 million was publicly unaccounted for. Wolkoff, as the event planner in charge, became the face of the disarray. The <em>Times</em> story quoted an official from a government watchdog group accusing the inaugural committee of “fiscal mismanagement at its worst.”</p>\n<p>Privately, Wolkoff refuted the characterization. According to bank statements, checks, and internal documents that I’ve reviewed, the $26 million in payment to WIS was largely distributed to third-party vendors and labor. Nearly $24 million was paid for projects related to the work of a subcontractor, Inaugural Productions, an independent organization run by individuals formerly associated with television producer <strong>Mark Burnett,</strong> which was responsible for staging several events. Around $1.6 million was used to compensate 15 contract workers who worked with Wolkoff as staffers. Wolkoff herself received $500,000 for her work on the inauguration. She had submitted audited records to the inauguration committee in March 2017, a month after she signed a gratuitous-services contract to work as an unpaid strategist and senior adviser to the First Lady.</p>\n<p>After the <em>Times</em> article, given her established documentation, Wolkoff urged Melania to defend her. But the administration demurred. <strong>Stephanie Grisham,</strong> the First Lady’s spokesperson, wrote in an e-mail, “This messaging is the best way to go in order to minimize the negative press stories of today and protect FLOTUS &amp; this administration.” A week later, Wolkoff left the East Wing after the White House instilled new security protocols in the wake of the <strong>Rob Porter</strong> scandal. A member of the White House Counsel’s Office called her on February 20, 2018, to let her know that the White House would be terminating all gratuitous-services agreements, including hers. It had nothing to do with her work on the inauguration, this person told her. “I am sorry that the professional part of our relationship has come to an end, but I am comforted in the fact that our [friendship] far outweigh[s] politics,” Melania wrote her in an e-mail later that day. “Thank you Again! Much love.”</p>\n<p>Later that evening, in a phone call, Wolkoff told the First Lady that she worried it appeared as if she had been fired on account of her work on the inauguration. The First Lady urged her not to be “dramatic.” Less than a week later, however, the <em>Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/melania-trump-inauguration-adviser.html\">published a story</a> stating that the severance of Wolkoff’s contract had been “prompted by displeasure from the Trumps” over the $26 million payment. Grisham told the <em>Times</em> that Melania “had no involvement” with the inaugural committee, and “had no knowledge of how funds were spent.” The president would create similar distance. <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> would later say, “The president was focused on the transition during that time, and not on any of the planning for the inauguration.” (A spokeswoman for the First Lady declined to comment for this story, as did the White House.)</p>\n<p>By the time Cohen and Wolkoff spoke last summer, she had returned to her life in New York. He would soon plead guilty to eight counts in a federal courthouse downtown. But Cohen let Wolkoff know that, among other documents and recordings, the F.B.I. had seized hours of their own conversations that he had taped. According to people familiar with the recordings, some of the taped conversations dealt directly with the inauguration. In them, Wolkoff detailed her own contemporaneous concerns with the inauguration&#8212;about how money was being spent, the general chaos of the process, and the involvement of Trump’s adult children. During these conversations, Wolkoff also raised her issues with the two men in charge of the committee: Gates and Barrack.</p>\n<p>These recordings, in part, led the Southern District of New York to launch a criminal investigation into how the inaugural committee spent its record $107 million. Now, the investigation appears to be advancing. In December, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-inauguration-spending-under-criminal-investigation-by-federal-prosecutors-11544736455\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/trump-inauguration-investigation.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported that prosecutors are examining the committee’s spending, and investigating whether foreign donors from nations including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates funneled money to the committee in an effort to influence U.S. policy. On Monday, the inaugural committee received a subpoena from the S.D.N.Y. requesting documents related to spending and donors, vendors, and benefits handed out, as well as documents related to a wealthy donor who had once registered as a foreign agent working on behalf of the Sri Lankan government. The <em>Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-inauguration-spending-under-criminal-investigation-by-federal-prosecutors-11544736455\">reported</a> that prosecutors have asked Gates about the inaugural fund’s spending and its donors. (<strong>Lorin Reisner</strong>, an attorney for Wolkoff, said in a statement: “Stephanie is not going to comment on these reports. She remains proud of her work on the inauguration, and we are confident that her conduct was proper in all respects.” Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>The subpoena is the latest sign that, while the Mueller investigation could be winding down, the Southern District may be probing a variety of Trump-adjacent avenues into the foreseeable future. An inquiry into the inauguration might also be acutely poignant, given Trump’s concurrent association with both his business and his incoming administration in its earliest days. It involved big money and outside influence. And it involved the Trump family in intimate, important ways. Wolkoff, suddenly and unexpectedly, could find herself in the middle of the maelstrom.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Wolkoff had made a career in the events business, but she knew from the outset the inauguration would be a unique, and uniquely Trumpian, experience. First, she was a political novice who knew little about what an inauguration entailed. Then, there was Trump’s controversial reputation. Upon accepting the post on the Friday after his election, Wolkoff quickly reached out to her network of vendors. Most of them, according to people familiar with these conversations, resisted the opportunity to work with Trump. Even Burnett, who Trump enlisted to conjure up reality-show-like gimmicks (such as flying a gaggle of drones over the crowd), wanted to keep his involvement private. (Burnett did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>Moreover, and perhaps not surprisingly, Trump’s family wanted to be involved in certain aspects of the coordination. Part of this, of course, was because they were going to be included in many of the events and, logistically, they had to know where to be and what to wear. It was also because Trump’s adult children have always been involved in affairs pertaining to their father, from his businesses to <em>The Apprentice</em> to his campaign. Each week, Wolkoff met with senior inaugural-committee members to present itemized, detailed updates on the status of her planning and financial reports from each vendor and for each event. She was also making regular presentations to Trump, Melania, and the Trump family about various decisions, so that they could weigh in. (White House spokespeople have previously denied that the Trumps were involved in any planning, and said they knew little about the events.) Trump and <strong>Ivanka</strong> were briefed on Burnett’s drone idea, for instance, after they had met with singer <strong>Andrea Bocelli</strong> in his office in Trump Tower about the possibility of him singing at an event. (The Italian tenor did not end up performing.)</p>\n<p>Trump was focused on the big-picture theatrics. He wanted to arrive on the Mall in a military plane with a military escort, much as he had arrived for tapings of <em>The Apprentice</em> on Trump Organization helicopters. He also wanted to have a full military parade, as well as tanks and helicopters on the ground. Ivanka, meanwhile, had more particular interests, according to e-mail and text exchanges and people familiar with the conversations. Originally, Ivanka wanted to host an event for women on the Wednesday before her father’s swearing-in ceremony. (The plan was ultimately scrapped.) To be helpful, she suggested a photographer who had once shot her for <em>Town &amp; Country</em> as someone who could take the official family portrait. She also offered a D.J. friend of hers from New York as a possible performer. She texted photos of the Obama family standing onstage together, with <strong>Sasha</strong> and <strong>Malia</strong> prominently situated in the middle of the frame. “FYI regarding the swearing in, it is nice to have family with him for this special moment,” she wrote.</p>\n<p>In large part, Wolkoff worried about potential ethical issues surrounding the First Family-elect and their businesses. After all, Gates had been staying in a suite at the Trump Hotel for most of the inaugural planning. More than a dozen inaugural staffers had also been staying there. The <em>Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/trump-inauguration-spending.html\">reported</a> last month that WIS alone had charged $31,000 for hotel rooms in the span of less than two months, including almost $18,000 at the Trump International Hotel. That did not include what was charged for room service, meals, and travel. In all, the Trump International Hotel was paid more than $1.5 million in inaugural funds, according to the <em>Times.</em> (Wolkoff’s contract states that the inaugural committee would reimburse WIS for travel, long-distance phone calls, mail-delivery services, and expenses connected to the performance of its work. WIS stands for “Who Is She,” Wolkoff’s play on her own anonymity.)</p>\n<p>During the course of planning, Wolkoff had corresponded with Ivanka about the cost of using the Trump Hotel for events leading up to the swearing-in ceremony. On December 10, 2016, a Trump Organization employee sent an estimate for a ballroom rental and food and beverage minimum to use the Trump Hotel space for eight days. The price she quoted was $3.6 million, according to an e-mail. A week later, Gates e-mailed Ivanka about the cost. In this exchange, first <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-trumps-inauguration-paid-trumps-company-with-ivanka-in-the-middle\">published</a> this past December by ProPublica and WNYC, Wolkoff flagged her concern. “These events are in PE’s [the president-elect’s] honor at his hotel and one of them is for family and close friends. Please take into consideration that when this is audited it will become public knowledge,” she wrote. (<strong>Peter Mirijanian,</strong> a spokesperson for Ivanka’s counsel <strong>Abbe Lowell,</strong> said in a statement: “When contacted by someone working on the inauguration, Ms. Trump passed the inquiry on to a hotel official and said only that any resulting discussions should be at a ‘fair market rate.’ Ms. Trump was not involved in any additional discussions.”)</p>\n<p>For an event producer used to detailed lists and punctilious itemization, Wolkoff was often caught off guard by the ad-hoc nature of the committee. According to the two people familiar with the matter, Gates approached a couple individuals working on the inauguration and asked if they would be willing to be paid directly for their work by a donor, rather than by the inaugural committee. They had received more donations than they’d initially anticipated, Gates told these people. Skirting the usual payment route could allow the inaugural committee to avoid reporting the full amount raised from donors. (A lawyer for Gates did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>Wolkoff frequently told Melania about her concerns regarding Gates, these people said. She relayed her concern about the high access level of his security pass within Trump Tower and his closeness with the Trump family. In her view, these people said, he exacerbated a situation already fraught with potential conflicts of interest. Members of the inaugural committee talked about how he frequently worked out of <strong>Donald Trump Jr.’s</strong> office. He was in constant communication with the adult children in order to keep them in the loop about decisions surrounding the inauguration.</p>\n<p>Wolkoff also questioned Gates and Barrack about pricing and budgets across the board, according to the people familiar with the conversations. She started to grow concerned about being left out of meetings, particularly as she raised more red flags. Because part of her responsibilities included reviewing all budgets from her vendors and presenting them to other members of the inaugural committee, she studied the line items in order to be able to explain them. At points, she could not justify the numbers coming in. After circulation of a quote from one of their largest event-production vendors, Hargrove LLC, Wolkoff was shocked that no one in the organization appeared willing to question the figures. She suggested that the quote seemed far beyond what the Obama inaugural committee would have been charged in 2009. She sent an e-mail to her team and Barrack on December 31, 2016. “I am DISGUSTED by [Hargrove’s] lack of transparency and entitlement to [the Presidential Inaugural Committee’s] funding,” she wrote. “I can not approve any budget line items because I do not have a clue what these numbers represent!!” (Hargrove did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>One of the most concerning aspects to Wolkoff’s team, according to the people familiar with the situation, was the amount of money and attention being spent on Barrack’s chairman dinner, which he hosted on an evening before the swearing-in. A draft guest list for the event from days before the dinner included the likes of retired Lieutenant General <strong>Mike Flynn,</strong> G.O.P. fund-raiser <strong>Elliott Broidy,</strong> Michael Cohen, and key officials in the incoming administration. Among the list marked as confirmed were seven people described as “foreign ministers” for Saudi Arabia, one foreign minister from Qatar, and one from the United Arab Emirates. They were the only people on the list who were unnamed. (On Tuesday, ProPublica <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-tom-barrack-colony-company-of-trump-inaugural-chair-sought-to-profit\">published</a> a memo that showed Barrack’s investment firm planned to profit from its connections to the Trump administration. A spokesperson called it “an outline of a proposed potential business plan which was never acted upon or implemented.”)</p>\n<p>A spokesman for Barrack declined to comment, but pointed me toward comments Barrack made in a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chairmans-global-dinner-most-exclusive-event-preceding-trump-inauguration-1484571781\"><em>Journal</em> report</a> published days before the inauguration. “The evening is intended to be the president-elect’s first fingerprint on the global canvas of social democracy and outreach,” Barrack said at the time, explaining that the evening was set up to reach out to local international diplomats and create a “hopeful tapestry of international cooperation and respect.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Much has been made of the various problems with the inauguration, from the lackluster crowd size to the president’s own “American carnage” speech, which struck a tone so dark that <strong>George W. Bush</strong> was reportedly heard calling it “some weird shit.” But Wolkoff’s part, the event itself, went off without a hitch, and the family was pleased. The day after the swearing-in ceremony was Wolkoff’s birthday. The Trumps sent flowers to the Trump Hotel room where she had been staying. She flew back to New York on a military plane with Melania, her stylist, hairdresser, makeup artist, and the rest of the Trump family, apart from the president, Ivanka, and <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> who remained in Washington.</p>\n<p>Much is still unknown about how inaugural funds were managed, or if the unaccounted for $40-odd million will ever be publicly explained. It’s unclear whether there was foreign influence, or illicit attempts to profit off of proceedings. What Gates has offered investigators&#8212;about anything, really, but about the inauguration, in particular&#8212;is also unclear. How deep the Southern District’s investigation into all of this is yet unknown. But much like some of Cohen’s other taped conversations, the discussions with Wolkoff about the inauguration may have turned out to be consequential. On the witness stand during <strong>Paul Manafort’s</strong> trial in Virginia last summer, prosecutors asked Gates if he charged personal expenses to the committee. “It’s possible,” he responded.</p>\n<p>As investigators continue to pursue the matter, they may find themselves in a familiar situation: seeking out former Trump allies-turned-adversaries who saw it all go down firsthand. One of the most inexplicable plot points in the whirling Trump drama has been the president’s public treatment of his former lawyer. Trump was aware that Cohen possessed all manner of damaging information about him, and yet he wasted few opportunities to disparage him publicly. Ultimately, Cohen implicated Trump in federal campaign-finance violations as he pleaded guilty. He spent more than 70 hours cooperating with federal investigators, opening his book to tell them what he knew about the president, his business, and the campaign. While Wolkoff’s treatment has been gentler, she’s been similarly isolated and publicly disparaged. And now, what she knows could be of interest to investigators, too.</p>\n<p><em>This story has been updated to reflect Mark Burnett&#39;s connection to Inaugural Productions.</em></p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Trump’s World","socialTitle":"“I Am Disgusted”: Behind the Scenes of Trump’s $107 Million Inauguration","socialDescription":"Stephanie Winston Wolkoff was the mastermind event producer behind Trump’s inaugural celebration, which has since come under S.D.N.Y. investigation.

Mick Mulvaney, chafing at the family, is eyeing the exits, as is Larry Kudlow.","body":"<p>After the pummeling he incurred during the 35-day shutdown&#8212;a self-inflicted punishment&#8212;<strong>Donald Trump</strong> was looking forward to his State of the Union address, seeing it as a presidential safe space where at least some of the attendees <em>had</em> to applaud for him. “He was in a great mood and really seemed ready to go,” a Republican who spoke with Trump before the speech told me. The generally positive response from his favored outlets&#8212;Drudge’s headline blared “Trump Rocks House”&#8212;has pleased the president this week, sources said. “He’s been in a good mood,” another prominent Republican said. And the no-socialism themes were seen as a potent weapon against Democrats in 2020&#8212;the first hopeful sign in a while.</p>\n<p>But while the State of the Union adjusted the president’s mood, it wasn’t enough to re-align the underlying dysfunction of the West Wing. Morale inside the White House, never high to begin with, has turned particularly bleak, according to interviews with 10 former West Wing officials and Republicans close to the president. The issue is that many see Trump himself as the problem. “Trump is hated by everyone inside the White House,” a former West Wing official told me. His shambolic management style, paranoia, and pattern of blaming staff for problems of his own making have left senior White House officials burned out and resentful, sources said. “It’s total misery. People feel trapped,” a former official said. “Trump always needs someone to blame,” a second former official said. Sources said the leak of Trump’s private schedules to Axios&#8212;which revealed how little work Trump actually does&#8212;was a signal of how disaffected his staff has become.</p>\n<p>White House Communications Director <strong>Bill Shine</strong> has told friends he’s angry that Trump has singled him out for the bad press during the government shutdown. “Bill is like, ‘you’re the guy who steps on the message more than anyone,’” said a Republican who’s spoken with Shine recently. Economic adviser <strong>Larry Kudlow</strong> has told people he’s probably got six months left. “Larry’s really tired of it all,” a source close to Kudlow said.</p>\n<p>What’s driving a lot of the frustration is that Trump, now more than ever, runs the West Wing as a family business. Four sources said the only White House advisers he truly consults are daughter <strong>Ivanka</strong> and son-in-law <strong>Jared Kushner.</strong> “This is a family affair, and if you’re not in the family, you’ve got problems,” a former official said. The special privileges and access afforded to Kushner and Ivanka have been alienating Trump’s acting chief of staff, <strong>Mick Mulvaney.</strong> “Mick is not entirely thrilled with the family,” a Republican close to Mulvaney told me. Multiple sources said Mulvaney is looking for a way out of the West Wing. He’s said to be interested in a Cabinet position, either at the Commerce Department or Treasury, and he’s reportedly been pursuing the University of South Carolina presidency. A senior White House official recently lobbied a friend of Mulvaney’s to convince Mulvaney to stay.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Mulvaney is working to stave off another political crisis before Trump either shuts the government down again or declares a state of emergency to fund his southern border wall. One source briefed on the internal debate said that Mulvaney is advising Trump to accept less than his demand of $5 billion and make up the difference by shuffling money around the existing budget. “Mick wants to re-program existing funds,” the source said. Trump has insisted he won’t compromise, but he faces no good options, with a G.O.P. revolt likely if he goes the national-emergency route. “Trump is going to declare whatever happens a victory,” a former West Wing official said.</p>\n<p>The White House declined to comment.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Capitol Hill","socialTitle":"“Trump Is Hated by Everyone”: Trump’s SOTU Euphoria Masks West Wing Misery","socialDescription":"The leak of his schedules is a sign of deep disaffection.

But when it comes to the federal contractors who also went unpaid during that period&#8212;up to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/13/18223471/back-pay-federal-contractors-shutdown\">580,000 people</a>, according to one estimate&#8212;it gets trickier. “I’ve been told the president won’t sign” anything that guarantees them back pay, Senator <strong>Roy Blunt</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-blocking-contractor-back-pay-gov-t-funding-deal-lawmaker-n971226\">told reporters</a> on Wednesday. “I guess federal contractors are different in his view than federal employees.”</p>\n<p>On the 2016 campaign trail, it was a well-known (but ultimately overlooked) fact that Trump <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-business-plan-left-a-trail-of-unpaid-bills-1465504454\">routinely refused to pay contractors</a> during his career as a businessman. But the idea of paying these contractors reportedly had bipartisan support, until <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> shot it down. A legislative source <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/429827-push-to-include-contractor-back-pay-in-funding-deal-hits-gop-roadblock\">told</a> the Hill that the administrative cost alone to pay back the contractors would be as high as the back pay itself, and that previous shutdown negotiations did not include this provision. “That was not initially part of our deal,” Senator <strong>Richard Shelby</strong> explained. “I personally would rather keep it narrow in scope.”</p>\n<p>Other Republicans, such as <strong>John Cornyn,</strong> seemed to take joy in turning contractor pain to political gain. “<strong>[Nancy] Pelosi</strong> and <strong>[Chuck] Schumer</strong> should have thought about this and other collateral damage when they initially refused to negotiate on border security, something they are apparently now willing to do,” he told NBC News. “Thousands of federal contractors have not been reimbursed from the 35-day shutdown,” Schumer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1095770911196831744\">said</a> in response to these reports. “This issue is hanging in the balance. . . . It’s just not fair.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

maintain his infamous orange hue, even while residing in wintry D.C.? It’s a question that persists into the third year of Trump’s tenure in the White House, and investigations of the matter have yielded surprising insight into the commander in chief’s styling habits.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/us/politics/trump-tan.html\">The New York Times</a></em> pursued the idea as a matter of Trump’s health, though a senior administration official only offered that Trump’s notable tan&#8212;in February, no less&#8212;is the result of “good genes.” Further investigation revealed that neither tanning beds nor spray-tan booths exist within the White House or Air Force One, at least according to senior officials. Former aide <strong>Omarosa Manigault Newman</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/death-spiral-why-omarosa-totally-triggered-trump\">wrote in a tell-all book</a> that Trump travels with a tanning bed, while lighter-hued circles around the president’s eyes have fueled speculation that he utilizes goggles to protect himself from ultraviolet rays.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, neither bronzer nor tanning cream has been observed among Trump’s bathroom grooming products, at least when the president has offered a tour of the facilities to supporters. Trump, who suffers from rosacea, is reported to apply his own translucent makeup powder before television appearances, and has even adjusted the lighting at White House events to avoid appearing too orange on-screen. When possible, he prefers the natural light of the White House Rose Garden.</p>\n<p>Trump’s orange hue has also proven a frequent source of media ridicule, even as <em>Saturday Night Live</em> star <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> has suggested makeup artists deliberately avoid exaggerating the shade&#8212;at <strong>Lorne Michaels’s</strong> behest&#8212;so as “not to over-orange anything out of malice.” Baldwin has otherwise described Trump’s look as somewhere between “Mark Rothko orange” and a “slightly paler Orange Crush.”</p>\n<p>The president is famously self-sufficient when it comes to appearance, even detailing the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/photos/2015/09/an-illustrated-history-of-donald-trumps-hair\">elaborate process</a> behind his signature swooping blond hair. And while an unnamed former campaign hand admitted Trump’s orange glow is “a captivating story,” they insisted Trump’s grooming habits are his own secret to keep.</p>","rubric":"45

The following is a list of his career highlights that presumably convinced Trump he should be given a job guiding the U.S.’s monetary policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>9-9-9:</strong> While running for president, Cain famously introduced a tax proposal called the 9-9-9 plan, which would have eliminated the tax system entirely and <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/sep/26/facts-about-herman-cains-9-9-9-tax-plan/\">replaced</a> it with a 9 percent personal income tax, a 9 percent corporate income tax, and a 9 percent national sales tax. Economists <a href=\"http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/9-9-9-the-most-massive-redistribution-of-taxes-ever-seriously-considered/\">called</a> it “The most massively regressive redistribution of taxes ever seriously considered” and <a href=\"https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/15/cain-unable/\">warned</a> that it would be “a huge tax increase on most Americans, but a huge tax cut on the wealthy.” (<strong>Paul Ryan</strong> and <strong>Larry Kudlow</strong> were, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/larry-kudlow-wants-trump-to-cut-taxes-again\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/paul-ryan-retirement-speech\">course</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/paul-ryan-loves-herman-cains-9-9-9-tax-plan-2011-10\">big</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/id/44909981\">fans</a>.) Cain <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2011/11/9-9-9-the-movie-069181#ixzz1h8QZfplI\">produced</a> a six-minute video called <em>9-9-9 the Movie: Slaying the Tax Monster,</em> but was apparently less receptive to IRL inquiries:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/morningmoneyben/status/1091020873350430720\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/morningmoneyben/status/1091020873350430720\">https://twitter.com/morningmoneyben/status/1091020873350430720</a></p></blockquote></div><ul>\n<li><strong>Uzbekistan:</strong> There is no question in our minds that Trump <em>loved</em> <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/herman-cain-i-dont-know-the-president-of-ubeki-beki-beki-stan-stan-a0ebdaf0014e/\">this 2011 exchange</a> between Cain and conservative reporter <strong>David Brody:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Brody: Are you ready for the ‘gotcha’ questions that are coming from the media and others on foreign policy? Like, who’s the president of Uzbekistan?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cain: I’m ready for the ‘gotcha’ questions and they’re already starting to come. And when they ask me who is the president of Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan I’m going to say, you know, I don’t know. Do you know?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-<strong>Gold:</strong> As of his presidential run, Cain <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/05/herman-cain-federal-reserve-chairman-tea-party-champion/239519/\">favored</a> a return to the gold standard, and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304070304577395891113592150\">wrote</a> in an op-ed for <em>The Wall Street Journal:</em> “A gold standard is to the moochers and looters in government what sunlight and garlic are to vampires.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pizza:</strong> Cain was the chief executive officer of Godfather’s Pizza. Trump obviously believes this makes Cain more qualified for the job than some loser PhD.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>-<strong>Sexual harassment:</strong> During Cain’s run for office, Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2011/10/exclusive-2-women-accused-cain-of-inappropriate-behavior-067194\">reported</a> that at least two female employees at the National Restaurant Association received financial settlements after making sexual harassment claims against Cain when he served as the group’s president. Cain vacillated between saying he was “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/01/herman-cain-settlement-sexual-harassment\">unaware of any sort of settlement</a>,” to admitting that they happened and he knew about them, to calling the whole thing a “witch hunt,” a line that undoubtedly scored him points with the Big Guy, who has been <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/women-accused-trump-sexual-misconduct-list-2017-12\">accused</a> of sexual misconduct by 22 separate women and has made “witch hunt” his <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/witches-to-trump-stop-calling-the-mueller-investigation-a-witch-hunt\">catchphrase</a> of choice.</p>\n<p>Shockingly for this administration, Cain <em>does</em> have some relevant work experience, having served as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City from 1992 to 1996, though, as <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/31/trump-considers-former-gop-presidential-candidate-herman-cain-federal-reserve/?utm_term=.0a2473cba88d\">notes</a>, “those posts are often given to business executives and community leaders who serve to inform top Fed officials about what they are seeing in the labor market and economy more broadly.” Or, as Dartmouth College economics professor <strong>Danny Blanchflower,</strong> who previously sat on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, put it:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/D_Blanchflower/status/1091015619061919745\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/D_Blanchflower/status/1091015619061919745\">https://twitter.com/D_Blanchflower/status/1091015619061919745</a></p></blockquote></div><p>One potential factor that <em>could</em> derail Cain’s candidacy? When he served on the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, he was known as an inflation hawk, which is the exact opposite of what Trump wants from the Fed, as exemplified by the fact that his handpicked Fed chair, <strong>Jerome Powell,</strong> is <em>this close</em> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/trump-spends-christmas-eve-trashing-the-federal-reserve\">to waking up with a horse’s head in his bed</a>. Still, it’s entirely possible, as <em>New York</em>’s <strong>Josh Barro</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbarro/status/1091013868715995137\">points out</a>, that “Trump assumes Cain has no fixed ideology and would do whatever he wants.” Anyway, if this Cain thing doesn’t work out, <strong>Jose Canseco</strong> is presumably <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/12/jose-canseco-wants-to-run-the-federal-reserve\">still interested in the gig</a>!</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Bernie Sanders not about to sit back and let Elizabeth Warren have all the fun</strong></p>\n<p>You want a “soak the rich”&#8211;style tax proposal? <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/01/31/bernie-sanders-propose-dramatic-expansion-estate-tax-richest-americans-including-percent-rate-billionaires/\">You got it</a>!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will unveil a plan Thursday to dramatically expand the federal estate tax on the wealthy, including a new 77 percent rate on billionaires&#39; estates, as leading Democratic politicians push new taxes on the richest Americans to combat inequality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sanders’s bill, the “For the 99.8% Act,” would tax the estates of the 0.2 percent of Americans who inherit more than $3.5 million, while the rest of the country “would not see their taxes go up by one penny under this plan,” according to aides to the Vermont senator, who is considering a 2020 presidential bid. . . . Sanders’s plan would restore the 77 percent top estate tax rate that was in place in the U.S. from 1941 to 1976, tax estates worth more than $3.5 million, and create several new estate tax brackets, including a 55 percent rate on estates worth more than $50 million.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Our bill does what the American people want us to be doing and that is to demand that the very wealthiest families in this country start paying their fair share of taxes,” Sanders <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/01/31/bernie-sanders-propose-dramatic-expansion-estate-tax-richest-americans-including-percent-rate-billionaires/?utm_term=.2268c54a4430\">said</a> in a press release. Of the decision by three top Republican senators this week to release a plan that would expunge the estate tax&#8212;already weakened from last year’s legislation&#8212;Sanders commented: “It is literally beyond belief that the Republican leadership wants to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top 0.2 percent of our population. . . . This is not only insane, it tells us the degree to which the billionaire class controls the Republican Party.”</p>\n<p><strong>Democrats are coming for Trump’s tax returns</strong></p>\n<p>Cue cries of “WITCH HUNT!” in <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/31/house-democrats-take-first-step-to-go-after-trumps-tax-returns.html\">3 . . . 2 . . .</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A House committee will hold a hearing next week on presidential tax returns as Democrats clamor for access to President Donald Trump’s elusive financial information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rep. <strong>John Lewis,</strong> a Georgia Democrat and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee’s Oversight Subcommittee, announced the event will take place on Feb. 7. The hearing in front of the Democratic-led panel is called “Legislative Proposals and Tax Law Related to Presidential and Vice-Presidential Tax Returns.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It marks the new Democratic House majority’s first formal step on the path to focusing on Trump’s tax returns. The president refused to release the documents during the 2016 campaign, in a break with decades of precedent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“This is the beginning of a court case,” Ways and Means Committee Chairman <strong>Richard Neal</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/29/politics/trump-tax-returns/index.html\">told</a> CNN. “I think the idea here is to avoid the emotion of the moment and make sure that the product stands up under critical analysis. And it will.”</p>\n<p><strong>Of course the White House used the shutdown to chip away at workers’ rights</strong></p>\n<p>With everyone focused on the wall, the Trump administration decided it was a great time to relieve employers of the burden of reporting workplace injuries to the Department of Labor, as part of the presidency’s ongoing attempt to return to the good old days when business owners didn’t have to comply with health and safety laws that obviously serve no other purpose than to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/29/18197346/trump-labor-electronic-injury-reporting-rule\">eat into their profits</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The partial government shutdown may have disrupted air travel and triggered financial hardship, but it didn’t stop the White House from continuing to dismantle regulations meant to protect U.S. workers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On Friday, the Trump administration gutted a 2016 rule that required most employers to electronically submit detailed reports of all workplace injuries to the Department of Labor each year&#8212;reports they’ve long been required to keep, but never required to submit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses rule would have allowed the government, for the first time, to get more complete data on how many U.S. workers are injured on the job and how those injuries happened. Enacted under the Obama administration, it was supposed to help inspectors identify dangerous work conditions, and in turn pressure businesses to comply with workplace safety laws.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Vox, the Office of Management and Budget “rushed the amendment through the three-month review process in just six weeks&#8212;even though the office was closed during the shutdown and two-thirds of the office’s employees were furloughed,” with the changes finalized on and published by Friday.</p>\n<p><strong>Hedge-fund C.E.O. thinks policy of ripping colleagues to shreds is actually really nice</strong></p>\n<p>“It’s kind of a family atmosphere,” Bridgewater Associates co-C.E.O. <strong>Eileen Murray</strong> <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/eileen-murray-bridgewater-associates-co-ceo-hails-hedge-funds-culture-51548870197\">said</a> of the firm’s unorthodox culture wherein employees must earn “<a href=\"https://inside.bwater.com/publications/principles_excerpt\">the right to have an opinion</a>,” are fired <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/what-in-gods-name-is-happening-at-the-worlds-largest-hedge-fund\">in firm-wide e-mails</a>, and are taken to task by the group in meetings called “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/business/dealbook/bridgewaters-ray-dalio-spreads-his-gospel-of-radical-transparency.html\">public hangings</a>.” She added: “I don’t know about you, but for me, my family tells me things I don’t want to hear. But they do it out of a sense of love and kindness . . . Some people think [the culture] sounds harsh and stressful. I think it’s very kind.”</p>\n<p><strong>Area man is very smart, very knowledgable about how stock market works</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed

Which is to say, we probably should have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/04/former-koch-official-runs-epa-chemical-research-1136230\">seen this one coming</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Trump administration has placed a former Koch Industries official in charge of research that will shape how the government regulates a class of toxic chemicals contaminating millions of Americans’ drinking water&#8212;an issue that could have major financial repercussions for his former employer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Dunlap,</strong> a deputy in E.P.A.’s Office of Research and Development, is playing a key role as the agency decides how to protect people from the pollution left behind at hundreds of military bases and factories across the country. . .He spent the previous eight years as Koch Industries’ lead expert on water and chemical regulations, a position that typically includes helping companies to limit regulatory restrictions and liability for cleanups.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dunlap was hired in October, according to previously undisclosed documents. Since then, he has been extremely busy, having reportedly been involved in high-level meetings that preceded the agency’s decision <em>not</em> to set drinking water limits for chemicals known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which “have been linked with kidney and testicular cancer, as well as other ailments.” (In a statement, <strong>David Ross</strong>, EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Water, told the Hive: “Despite what is being reported, EPA has not finalized or publicly issued its PFAS management plan, and any information that speculates what is included in the plan is premature. The agency is committed to following the Safe Drinking Water Act process for evaluating new drinking water standards, which is just one of the many components of the draft plan that is currently undergoing interagency review.”) According to Politico, Dunlap has been able to avoid a Senate confirmation hearing in which his prior work experience might come up because Trump has not officially nominated anyone to run to office. (Dunlap’s <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/research/david-dunlap\">official bio</a> on the E.P.A. Web site declines to mention any of his employers during his “more than 30 years” working for “private industry, trade associations and as an environmental consultant.”) Currently, Koch subsidiary Georgia-Pacific, a paper and pulp conglomerate, is facing at least one class-action suit related to chemicals now under Dunlap’s purview.</p>\n<p>Koch’s various environmental crimes against humanity are laid out in several high-profile lawsuits over the past 20 years. According to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111005022145/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-02/koch-brothers-flout-law-getting-richer-with-secret-iran-sales.html\">Bloomberg</a>, “Koch Industries was assessed more than $400 million in fines, penalties, and judgments” between 1999 and 2003, such as for dumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of aviation fuel into a Minnesota wetland. “You want an independent, hardheaded scientific review of these issues; you don’t want somebody who is already taking the industry party line,” <strong>Erik Olson,</strong> who heads up the Natural Resources Defense Council’s public health work, told Politico. “There’s a legitimate threat there and, from my perspective, the conflicts of interest that [Dunlap] has having worked as a regulatory compliance director at Georgia-Pacific raises questions about whether he can make those objective decisions or should be recused.”</p>\n<p>Dunlap, of course, is unlikely to be replaced by someone without a host of conflicts of interest given that the guy currently running the E.P.A., <strong>Andrew Wheeler,</strong> is a walking, talking conflict of interest, having <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/07/06/626525274/get-to-know-andrew-wheeler-ex-coal-lobbyist-with-inside-track-to-lead-epa\">served as a coal-lobbyist</a> prior to taking over the top job from departed Grift King <strong>Scott Pruitt.</strong> It is, in other words, par for the course.

troops depart.","promoDek":"America’s allies “unanimously” declined the Trump administration’s request to pick up the slack in Syria when U.S. troops depart.","body":"<p>Yet again, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has jumped the gun. Last week, the Trump administration revealed plans to remove all American troops from Syria by the end of April&#8212;a position long championed by the president. The move rankled even some congressional allies like Senator <strong>Lindsey Graham,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">apparently</a> made his displeasure known to Acting Defense Secretary <strong>Patrick Shanahan</strong> over the weekend. Now, it’s clear lawmakers weren’t the only ones blindsided by the planned withdrawal&#8212;key United States allies appear to have been left out of the loop as well.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/allies-say-they-wont-remain-in-syria-after-us-troops-withdraw/2019/02/20/62e503b2-3532-11e9-a400-e481bf264fdc_story.html?utm_term=.9c6870c65501\">reported</a> that U.S. allies “unanimously” declined the Trump administration’s request to pick up the slack fighting ISIS in Syria if the U.S. removes its troops in the spring, as Trump has apparently directed Shanahan to do. A senior administration official told the <em>Post</em> that allies have made it clear they “won’t stay if you pull out.” Trump’s hasty move, then, could leave behind a powder keg. “It’s not safe to leave these enemies there, without any referee or mediating force,” said a U.S. official.</p>\n<p>His approach to Syria is the latest example of Trump’s seeming tendency to push policy without working out the details, which has frustrated even some of his closest allies. “That’s the dumbest fucking idea I’ve ever heard,” Graham evidently <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">told</a> Shanahan of Trump’s withdrawal plan in a meeting in Munich last Saturday. The South Carolina Republican, normally a staunch defender of the president, has been venting about the administration’s Syria policy since December, when Trump suddenly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/donald-trump-syria-troops\">announced</a> it would be up to other nations to fight ISIS there&#8212;despite also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1075397797929775105\">claiming</a> that the terrorist organization had been “defeated.” Graham torched the policy, saying at the time that he would “hold the administration accountable for this decision,” and threatened hearings over the planned move.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to imagine that any president would wake up and make this kind of decision with this little communication,” Republican Senator <strong>Bob Corker</strong> said at the time.</p>\n<p>But it appears that’s precisely how Trump has approached one of the most complicated foreign-policy conundrums of his presidency. While the commander-in-chief seemingly continues to talk out of his ass&#8212;on Friday, he said he would announce the “eradication of the caliphate . . . over the next 24 hours,” but no such announcement has come&#8212;U.S. allies appear to be losing patience. Last week, French Foreign Minister <strong>Jean-Yves Le Drian</strong> <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/u-s-pullout-from-syria-benefits-iran-says-french-fm-1.6938647\">called</a> Trump’s call for withdrawal a “mystery,” and British Foreign Secretary <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> has said that “there is no prospect of British forces replacing the Americans” in Syria. Their pushback has left Trump hanging. Whether it will be enough to force him to reconsider remains to be seen.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a

These are all things <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has said or tweeted about his apparently unprecedented, Herculean work ethic since moving into the Oval Office. One thing he hasn’t tweeted? “I had a giant golf simulator built in the White House to break up <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/364094-trump-watches-at-least-four-hours-of-tv-per-day-report\">my long hours of TV watching</a> on the days I can’t make it to one of my many golf courses, where I’ve spent hundreds of mornings and afternoons over the past two years.” But according to <em>The Washington Post,</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/president-trump-installed-a-room-sized-golf-simulator-at-white-house/2019/02/13/ed3f6d5c-2e45-11e9-813a-0ab2f17e305b_story.html\">he has</a> in fact done just that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>President Trump has installed a room-sized “golf simulator” game at the White House, which allows him to play virtual rounds at courses all over the world by hitting a ball into a large video screen, according to two people told about the system. . . .

He often spends this time watching TV, tweeting, holding impromptu meetings and making phone calls, aides have said. Trump has played golf&#8212;the traditional kind, on an outdoor course&#8212;about 139 times as president, largely at his own golf clubs, according to an analysis by <em>The Washington Post.</em> There is no way to have an exact count because he usually does not acknowledge having played.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For those of you keeping track, an installation that took place “during the last few weeks” likely occurred at the tail end of the government shutdown, a period in which Trump reportedly <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-misses-mar-lago-stuck-white-house-shutdown-report-1292157\">complained</a> to friends about missing Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach resort and golf club of choice. Apparently, he got so wound up that he never again wanted to contemplate a situation in which he wouldn’t be able to stop whatever else he was doing during “executive time” to whack a few balls. (Thankfully, Trump broke his days-not-playing-golf streak on February 2, getting a round in with <strong>Tiger Woods</strong> and <strong>Jack Nicklaus</strong> at his course in Jupiter, Florida.)</p>\n<p>While Trump’s unparalleled laziness has been well-documented&#8212;we’ve known for some time now that the president <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/trump-schedule-executive-time\">rarely makes it out of the residence before 11 A.M., and punches out just after 4 P.M.</a>&#8212;people would probably care a lot less about his golf routine if he hadn’t spent eight years going after Obama (who also had an on-site simulator, though an “an older, less sophisticated” version) for the same nasty habit.

In fact, the whole thing felt so bizarre and over-the-top obsequious that A.M.I. apparently had some qualms of its own.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/national-enquirer-publisher-asked-justice-department-for-advice-on-saudi-connection-11549908996\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, the publisher “sought advice from the Justice Department” last year over whether its obvious propaganda would cross the line between substandard journalism and literally working as an agent of a foreign government. While A.M.I. claimed in the past that Saudi officials had no role in the magazine’s creation, in fact, the publisher gave an adviser to the Kingdom a draft of the magazine and followed the adviser’s editorial advice, per a letter to the D.O.J. However, because there was no official contract stating the company <em>had</em> to follow the adviser’s suggestions&#8212;because, in other words, A.M.I. did so simply out of its love for M.B.S., or as a person familiar with the matter put it, in an attempt to “kiss his ass”&#8212;the Justice Department ruled that the publisher was not required to register as a foreign agent, a conclusion it warned could change if the facts “are different in any way from those depicted in your submission.”</p>\n<p>Of course, last summer’s glossy isn’t the only time A.M.I. has crossed paths with the Kingdom, directly or indirectly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In recent years, American Media sought Saudi financial backing to finance a failed effort to acquire <em>Time</em> magazine, <em>Sports Illustrated,</em> <em>Fortune,</em> and <em>Money,</em> the <em>Journal</em> reported last year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>American Media confirmed the contacts but said the only deal that has ever been discussed with Saudi investors was the expansion of the Mr. Olympia bodybuilding competition, which American Media owns, into the Middle East and North Africa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The lawyer for [publisher <strong>David] Pecker,</strong> <strong>Elkan Abramowitz,</strong> on Sunday on ABC said American Media sought financing “from the Saudis, but never obtained any.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s also the matter of A.M.I.’s long-standing ties to Trump, who has gone out of his way to support Saudi Arabia, including (allegedly!) <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/unusual-statement-disputing-cia-filled-exclamation-points-trump-backs-saudi-n938526\">letting its de facto leader get away with the murder of a U.S. resident</a>. That issue came up last week, when Amazon founder <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> published a blog post <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-ami-medium\">accusing</a> <em>The National Enquirer</em> of attempting to extort him if he didn’t drop his investigation into how his private messages fell into their lap, and publicly state that that he had “no knowledge or basis for suggesting that A.M.I.’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.” As Bezos wrote in his <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/hes-a-genius-wall-street-praises-bezos-for-dick-pic-moxie\">widely praised dick-pic confessional</a>, “the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve.”</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Trump wants investigation into his sham charity halted because New York A.G.s were mean to him</strong></p>\n<p>Back in December, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/donald-trump-charity-shut-down\">shuttered</a> the Donald J. Trump Foundation as part of an agreement with the New York Attorney General’s office, which has alleged that the “charity” served as little more than a slush fund for the former real-estate developer’s business and political interests. In addition to allegedly spending $10,000 of the foundation’s money <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-clue-to-the-whereabouts-of-the-6-foot-tall-portrait-of-donald-trump/2016/09/14/ae65db82-7a8f-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html?utm_term=.76892d132ab1\">on a six-foot-tall oil painting of Trump</a>, the group’s board, made up of the president’s eldest children, never once held a meeting. (Trump Organization C.F.O. <strong>Allen Weisselberg</strong> apparently had no idea he was an officer <a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/779101/trump-foundations-treasurer-didnt-know-treasurer-until-investigators-told\">until investigators told him as much</a>.) Unfortunately for the Donald, simply closing the (<em>alleged</em>) sham charity has not stopped the investigation. “We’ll continue to move our suit forward to ensure that the Trump Foundation and its directors are held to account for their clear and repeated violations of state and federal law,” outgoing N.Y. A.G. <strong>Barbara Underwood</strong> said at the time. So now <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-11/trump-renews-claim-that-n-y-suit-against-his-charity-is-biased\">his lawyers are trying to get it thrown out on the grounds that investigators said mean things about him</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>New York’s June lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation should be barred over comments made by [the state’s new attorney general, <strong>Letitia] James,</strong> and predecessors Barbara Underwood and <strong>Eric Schneiderman,</strong> who were both vocal Trump critics, Trump’s attorney <strong>Alan Futerfas</strong> said in documents filed last week in state court in Manhattan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>James called Trump an “illegitimate president” in the months before her November election and vowed to “use every area of the law” to investigate the real-estate mogul, his businesses, and his family, according to the filing. Statements by all three attorneys general “express clear bias and animus and constitute an unlawful appearance of impropriety.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, it’s not surprising that a person vowing to use “the law” to investigate the president would send shivers down Team Trump’s collective spine, though it’s not clear this tack will work after having already failed a first time. Back in November, New York State Supreme Court Justice <strong>Saliann Scarpulla</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-23/trump-foundation-must-defend-attorney-general-suit-judge-says\">rejected</a> Trump’s attorneys’ attempt to get the suit dismissed on claims of “political bias,” saying, “There is no basis for finding that animus and bias were the sole motivating factors for initiating the investigation and pursuing this proceeding.” Or, in other words, <em>these officials might think you’re the world’s slimiest weasel, but that’s not the ONLY reason they launched this probe.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Founding member of the “Trump Caucus” still blowing campaign funds on leisure-time activities</strong></p>\n<p>Remember Rep. <strong>Duncan Hunter</strong>? For those who need a quick refresher, he’s the California congressman and Trump super-fan who was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/duncan-hunter-indictment\">indicted last year</a>, along with his wife, <strong>Margaret Hunter,</strong> on charges of wire fraud, falsifying records, campaign-finance violations, conspiracy, and “convert[ing] campaign funds to personal use,” the latter of which allegedly <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/22/politics/duncan-hunter-indicted/index.html\">included</a>: a 2015 family vacation to Italy that cost more than $14,000; a $6,500 spring-break trip to Hawaii; a $3,700 jaunt to Las Vegas and Boise; $229 at Disneyland’s Star Trader gift shop; $253.62 at SeaWorld’s Aquatica waterpark; meals at fine-dining establishments and fast-food restaurants alike; a $2,000 birthday gift for a family member to attend a Pittsburgh Steelers game; and a three-night, $1,000 stay at the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa and Casino for a “personal ski trip,” among other things. At the time, the Hunters insisted through a spokesman that the indictment against them was “politically motivated,” with Duncan later trying to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/23/politics/duncan-hunter-wife-margaret-campaign-finances/index.html\">blame everything on his wife</a>. Anyway, it appears that <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-hunter-douglas-drones-20190206-story.html\">the couple is up to their old tricks</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the last five weeks of 2018, Rep. Duncan Hunter’s campaign reported spending hundreds of dollars at a local amusement park and made $2,000 in charges&#8212;now disputed&#8212;to a technology company that flies drones. The spending at Belmont Park, [an amusement park] in Mission Beach, and the disputed charges at ByteSignal, a Missouri-based technology company, are among $119,861 in expenditures Hunter’s campaign disclosed to the Federal Election Commission on Thursday, in a financial report covering November 27 through December 31. During the same weeks, the campaign reported raising $2,376.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, these expenditures are a drop in the bucket compared to the $250,000 in campaign funds the Hunters allegedly misappropriated between 2009 and 2016, but if you’re facing a criminal trial&#8212;the couple has pleaded not guilty&#8212;maybe just use your own money at the amusement park.</p>\n<p><strong>Report: another shutdown would have not-great consequences</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to putting nearly 1 million federal employees out of work (or forcing them to work without pay), a second potential shutdown would <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-11/debt-limit-looms-as-mind-numbing-impasse-stokes-shutdown-risk\">put the U.S. economy at major risk</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The standoff in Washington that’s increasing the chances of another U.S. government shutdown at the end of the week is also raising the specter of bigger risks as the reinstatement of the debt ceiling approaches in early March.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moody’s Investors Service analysts have warned that shutdown 2.0 could have a “more severe impact” on U.S. output. And if it were to extend beyond the March 1 end of the suspension of the current cap on America’s statutory debt capacity, “it would complicate negotiations over the debt ceiling.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Last month, Fitch Ratings’ global head of sovereign ratings, <strong>James McCormack,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-is-turning-america-into-another-bankrupt-casino\">warned</a> that the country’s mounting debt is weighing on the U.S., and the inability to deal with “meaningful fiscal deterioration” with a shut government could put our triple-A rating at risk. (A credit downgrade&#8212;which has only happened once since 1941&#8212;would make it harder for the U.S. government to borrow money and increase borrowing costs.)</p>\n<p><strong>Area man doesn’t understand why Democrats get themselves so wound up over investigations, fascism, the law, etc.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094964052558823424\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094964052558823424\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094964052558823424</a></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>Morgan Stanley, in Its Biggest Deal Since Crisis, Courts Future Millionaires (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-in-its-biggest-deal-since-crisis-courts-future-millionaires-11549885394\"><em>W.S.J.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Kamala Harris calls for marijuana legalization: ‘I think it gives a lot of people joy’ (<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/11/kamala-harris-2020-marijuana-legalization-1163795\">Politico</a>)</p>\n<p>She Spoke Up About Sexual Harassment At Ernst &amp; Young And Got Caught In A Web of Retaliation (<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ernst-and-young-sexual-harassment-karen-ward_us_5c14080ee4b009b8aea73086\">HuffPost</a>)</p>\n<p>Millions of Americans could be stunned as their tax refunds shrink (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/02/10/millions-americans-could-be-stunned-their-tax-refunds-shrink/\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>)</p>\n<p>The Next Wave of ‘Unicorn’ Start-Ups (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/technology/new-wave-unicorn-start-ups.html\"><em>N.Y.T.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Grading the impact of Trump’s China tariffs (<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-tariffs-china-trade-war-impact-8dd42cf5-983a-4eb9-a111-16132eeef1f8.html\">Axios</a>)</p>\n<p>Fyre Fest founder ordered to pay $2.9M to investment company (<a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/02/08/fyre-fest-founder-ordered-to-pay-2-9m-to-investment-company/\"><em>N.Y.P.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Cows Get Own Tinder-Style App for Breeding (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-10/cows-get-tinder-app-as-u-k-breeders-seek-moo-love-for-herds\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>Does Your Company Need to Know Your Body-Mass Index?

impossible to know where to begin with the Donald, and you could write <em>War and Peace</em> and still not get close to describing the last six months of his 2016 presidential campaign&#8212;as if there’s a word that could possibly describe it. So let’s just zero in on the money.\n<p>“I’m <em>really</em> rich,” Trump declared while announcing his candidacy in June 2015. To prove it, he released a “Summary of Net Worth” balance sheet, indicating a net worth of $8,737,540,000. A month later he upwardly revised that figure to “in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.” (The caps are his.)</p>\n<p>Since then, a cottage industry of spreadsheet-diving journalists has worked itself into a lather trying to peg his real net worth. But without tax returns to go on, it’s really anybody’s guess. Despite the all-caps figures Trump has dispensed, most estimates from the established financial-media outlets have been lower, FAR LOWER. <em>Forbes</em> put his net worth at $4.5 billion. <em>Fortune</em> postulated $3.7 billion, and later upped it to $3.9 billion. Bloomberg guessed it was “closer to $2.9 billion.”</p>\n<p>In response to these wanton guesstimates, Trump instinctually fired back at the guesstimators. “<em>Forbes</em> is a bankrupt magazine, doesn’t know what they’re talking about.” “<em>Fortune</em> has no idea what my assets are” and “has totally lost its way.” But the real sulfuric acid was reserved for the lowballers over at Bloomberg. As usual, Trump made it personal, even suggesting his “friend,” the former New York City mayor, might be jealous. “Maybe Michael told them to do it,” Trump speculated in the <em>Daily Mail,</em> “because he always wanted to do what I’m doing.” Perhaps wisely, <em>The New Yorker</em>&#8212;even with its legendary phalanx of persnickety fact-checkers&#8212;wouldn’t venture any closer than “just a back-of-the-envelope calculation” of $2.56 billion, “which shouldn’t be taken too seriously.”</p>\n<p>In November, Trump was elected president of the United States in a shocking turn of events. He lost the popular vote by some two million ballots.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/donald-trump","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"5748bf9ab58adb2f614da195","revision":5,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"August 1, 2017 5:46 pm","uri":"people/donald-trump"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Trump Reportedly Does All His Own Makeup","promoHed":"Trump Reportedly Does All His Own Makeup","dek":"If no tanning beds exist within White House walls, what is the source of Trump’s infamous hue?","promoDek":"If no tanning beds exist within White House walls, what is the source of Trump’s infamous hue?","body":"<p>Long before <strong>President Trump</strong> decried investigations of his office over Twitter, a gentler query dogged the celebrity businessman: how does he maintain his infamous orange hue, even while residing in wintry D.C.? It’s a question that persists into the third year of Trump’s tenure in the White House, and investigations of the matter have yielded surprising insight into the commander in chief’s styling habits.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/us/politics/trump-tan.html\">The New York Times</a></em> pursued the idea as a matter of Trump’s health, though a senior administration official only offered that Trump’s notable tan&#8212;in February, no less&#8212;is the result of “good genes.” Further investigation revealed that neither tanning beds nor spray-tan booths exist within the White House or Air Force One, at least according to senior officials. Former aide <strong>Omarosa Manigault Newman</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/death-spiral-why-omarosa-totally-triggered-trump\">wrote in a tell-all book</a> that Trump travels with a tanning bed, while lighter-hued circles around the president’s eyes have fueled speculation that he utilizes goggles to protect himself from ultraviolet rays.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, neither bronzer nor tanning cream has been observed among Trump’s bathroom grooming products, at least when the president has offered a tour of the facilities to supporters. Trump, who suffers from rosacea, is reported to apply his own translucent makeup powder before television appearances, and has even adjusted the lighting at White House events to avoid appearing too orange on-screen. When possible, he prefers the natural light of the White House Rose Garden.</p>\n<p>Trump’s orange hue has also proven a frequent source of media ridicule, even as <em>Saturday Night Live</em> star <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> has suggested makeup artists deliberately avoid exaggerating the shade&#8212;at <strong>Lorne Michaels’s</strong> behest&#8212;so as “not to over-orange anything out of malice.” Baldwin has otherwise described Trump’s look as somewhere between “Mark Rothko orange” and a “slightly paler Orange Crush.”</p>\n<p>The president is famously self-sufficient when it comes to appearance, even detailing the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/photos/2015/09/an-illustrated-history-of-donald-trumps-hair\">elaborate process</a> behind his signature swooping blond hair. And while an unnamed former campaign hand admitted Trump’s orange glow is “a captivating story,” they insisted Trump’s grooming habits are his own secret to keep.</p>","rubric":"45

who work for him.","body":"<p>So far, despite all the hurried negotiations over the details of border-security funding, Congress seems to be in agreement that the government will not shut down again on Friday, and has agreed to back pay some 800,000 federal workers the salaries they missed during the previous 35-day shutdown. But when it comes to the federal contractors who also went unpaid during that period&#8212;up to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/13/18223471/back-pay-federal-contractors-shutdown\">580,000 people</a>, according to one estimate&#8212;it gets trickier. “I’ve been told the president won’t sign” anything that guarantees them back pay, Senator <strong>Roy Blunt</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-blocking-contractor-back-pay-gov-t-funding-deal-lawmaker-n971226\">told reporters</a> on Wednesday. “I guess federal contractors are different in his view than federal employees.”</p>\n<p>On the 2016 campaign trail, it was a well-known (but ultimately overlooked) fact that Trump <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-business-plan-left-a-trail-of-unpaid-bills-1465504454\">routinely refused to pay contractors</a> during his career as a businessman. But the idea of paying these contractors reportedly had bipartisan support, until <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> shot it down. A legislative source <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/429827-push-to-include-contractor-back-pay-in-funding-deal-hits-gop-roadblock\">told</a> the Hill that the administrative cost alone to pay back the contractors would be as high as the back pay itself, and that previous shutdown negotiations did not include this provision. “That was not initially part of our deal,” Senator <strong>Richard Shelby</strong> explained. “I personally would rather keep it narrow in scope.”</p>\n<p>Other Republicans, such as <strong>John Cornyn,</strong> seemed to take joy in turning contractor pain to political gain. “<strong>[Nancy] Pelosi</strong> and <strong>[Chuck] Schumer</strong> should have thought about this and other collateral damage when they initially refused to negotiate on border security, something they are apparently now willing to do,” he told NBC News. “Thousands of federal contractors have not been reimbursed from the 35-day shutdown,” Schumer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1095770911196831744\">said</a> in response to these reports. “This issue is hanging in the balance. . . . It’s just not fair.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

let go of his longtime rivalry with <em>S.N.L.,</em> squeezing in a ding at the “Democrat spin machine” here, a defense of <strong>Kanye West</strong> there, but largely ignoring its jabs. That appeared to change Sunday morning, as Trump resumed his full-throated attacks after a particularly scathing series of sketches. “Nothing funny about tired <em>Saturday Night Live</em> on Fake News NBC!” he tweeted.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The president presumably caught wind of Saturday’s cold open, which featured <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> reprising his long-standing impression to mock the president’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-national-emergency-declaration-wall\">declaration</a> of a national emergency on Friday.

You don’t have to be smart to understand that&#8212;in fact, it’s even easier to understand if you’re not that smart,” he said, increasingly stunting his grammar. “You can all see why I gotta fake this national emergency, right? I have to because I want to. It’s really simple. We have a problem. Drugs are coming into this country through no wall.”</p>\n<p>The impression also took aim at Trump’s own sing-song recital of the challenges his declaration will face in court.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ll immediately be sued, and the ruling will not go in my favor and then\nend up in the Supreme Court, and then I’ll call my buddy Kavanaugh\nand I’ll say, ‘It’s time to repay the Donny,’ and he’ll say, ‘New phone, who dis?’\nAnd by then the Mueller report will be released, crumbling my house of cards,\nand I can just plead insanity and do a few months in the puzzle factory and my\npersonal hell of playing president will finally be over.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the real Trump threatening “retribution” for NBC’s “Republican hit jobs,” the president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097117499336855553\">reiterated his talking point</a> that “THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!” Trump had kept largely silent on the topic of <em>S.N.L.</em> in recent months, only piping up when supporter Kanye West controversially <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/kanye-west-trump-rant-video-saturday-night-live-snl-chris-rock-instagram\">donned a “Make America Great Again” hat</a> in a September outro:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1046443996074127361\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1046443996074127361\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1046443996074127361</a></p></blockquote></div><p>He also raged against the network in December, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1074302851906707457\">tweeting</a>, “A REAL scandal is the one sided coverage, hour by hour, of networks like NBC &amp; Democrat spin machines like <em>Saturday Night Live.</em> It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials.

She’s going to destroy all of you,’” he <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/02/13/donald-trump-jr-and-kimberly-guilfoyle-to-keep-it-low-key-for-valentines-day/\">told</a> the <em>New York Post.</em></p>\n<p>Toi’s finale look was an American flag skirt that could very well come to a <strong>Joy Villa</strong> near you next fall. (Wow, can’t believe this guy is co-signing a person dragging the American flag on the floor like that. What a shame&#8212;it’s like he doesn’t even respect America anymore, etc.) The designer made a special stop at the end of the runway to kiss Guilfoyle and shake Don’s hand. Who knows what he’s thinking as he smiles down at the designer. My best guess? “She’s going to destroy all of you,” over and over again, forever.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The dirty truth about <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/the-dirty-secret-of-el-chapo-downfall?inline\">El Chapo’s downfall</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; That time <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/brian-rea-modern-love-death-wins-a-goldfish?inline\">death took a break</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The 25 <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/25-best-movie-scenes?inline\">most influential movie scenes</a> of the past 25 years</p>\n<p>&#8212; Acupuncture and hypno-birthing?

Let Koch’s expert on water and chemical regulations decide.","body":"<p>Of all the federal agencies that fall under <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> purview, none embodies the administration’s unofficial mandate to do the exact opposite of its stated mission quite like the Environmental Protection Agency. For the last two years, the E.P.A.&#8212;which, as a reminder, is supposed to be protecting human health and the environment&#8212;has done everything in its power to turn the planet into an ashtray and convince Americans that toxic chemicals are actually totally fine to drink, breathe, and otherwise ingest, all in an effort to help companies secreting those chemicals maximize their profits. Which is to say, we probably should have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/04/former-koch-official-runs-epa-chemical-research-1136230\">seen this one coming</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Trump administration has placed a former Koch Industries official in charge of research that will shape how the government regulates a class of toxic chemicals contaminating millions of Americans’ drinking water&#8212;an issue that could have major financial repercussions for his former employer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Dunlap,</strong> a deputy in E.P.A.’s Office of Research and Development, is playing a key role as the agency decides how to protect people from the pollution left behind at hundreds of military bases and factories across the country. . .He spent the previous eight years as Koch Industries’ lead expert on water and chemical regulations, a position that typically includes helping companies to limit regulatory restrictions and liability for cleanups.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dunlap was hired in October, according to previously undisclosed documents. Since then, he has been extremely busy, having reportedly been involved in high-level meetings that preceded the agency’s decision <em>not</em> to set drinking water limits for chemicals known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which “have been linked with kidney and testicular cancer, as well as other ailments.” (In a statement, <strong>David Ross</strong>, EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Water, told the Hive: “Despite what is being reported, EPA has not finalized or publicly issued its PFAS management plan, and any information that speculates what is included in the plan is premature. The agency is committed to following the Safe Drinking Water Act process for evaluating new drinking water standards, which is just one of the many components of the draft plan that is currently undergoing interagency review.”) According to Politico, Dunlap has been able to avoid a Senate confirmation hearing in which his prior work experience might come up because Trump has not officially nominated anyone to run to office. (Dunlap’s <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/research/david-dunlap\">official bio</a> on the E.P.A. Web site declines to mention any of his employers during his “more than 30 years” working for “private industry, trade associations and as an environmental consultant.”) Currently, Koch subsidiary Georgia-Pacific, a paper and pulp conglomerate, is facing at least one class-action suit related to chemicals now under Dunlap’s purview.</p>\n<p>Koch’s various environmental crimes against humanity are laid out in several high-profile lawsuits over the past 20 years. According to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111005022145/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-02/koch-brothers-flout-law-getting-richer-with-secret-iran-sales.html\">Bloomberg</a>, “Koch Industries was assessed more than $400 million in fines, penalties, and judgments” between 1999 and 2003, such as for dumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of aviation fuel into a Minnesota wetland. “You want an independent, hardheaded scientific review of these issues; you don’t want somebody who is already taking the industry party line,” <strong>Erik Olson,</strong> who heads up the Natural Resources Defense Council’s public health work, told Politico. “There’s a legitimate threat there and, from my perspective, the conflicts of interest that [Dunlap] has having worked as a regulatory compliance director at Georgia-Pacific raises questions about whether he can make those objective decisions or should be recused.”</p>\n<p>Dunlap, of course, is unlikely to be replaced by someone without a host of conflicts of interest given that the guy currently running the E.P.A., <strong>Andrew Wheeler,</strong> is a walking, talking conflict of interest, having <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/07/06/626525274/get-to-know-andrew-wheeler-ex-coal-lobbyist-with-inside-track-to-lead-epa\">served as a coal-lobbyist</a> prior to taking over the top job from departed Grift King <strong>Scott Pruitt.</strong> It is, in other words, par for the course.

The president showed up about 40 minutes late to his planned speech Friday morning in the Rose Garden and immediately began rambling about trade negotiations with China. He proceeded to go on a long tangent about trade, Brexit, Syria, and his plans for a second summit with North Korea’s <strong>Kim Jong Un,</strong> all without the use of a teleprompter. Eventually he got to the point. “I’m going to be signing a national emergency,” Trump said. According to White House officials, the declaration will allow Trump to redirect $3.6 billion from the military, $2.5 billion from counter-narcotics programs, and $600 million from the Treasury to build a border wall that Congress refused to fund.</p>\n<p>Trump appeared resigned to being sued for what both Democrats and Republicans have denounced as an unconstitutional power grab. “We will have a national emergency, and we will then be <em>sued,</em>” he explained, breaking into a strange sing-song voice. “And they will sue us in the Ninth <em>Circuit,</em> even though it <em>shouldn’t</em> be there, and we will possibly get a bad <em>ruling,</em> and then we’ll get another bad <em>ruling,</em> and then we’ll end up in the Supreme <em>Court,</em> and hopefully we’ll get a fair <em>shake,</em> and we’ll win in the Supreme <em>Court</em> just like the <em>ban.</em>”</p>\n<p>The government lawyers who will inevitably have to argue that case were surely appalled by what came next. “We have so much money. But on the wall, they skimped,” he said, complaining that Congress had not given him the $5.7 billion in funding he wanted. “I didn’t need to do this,” he added, potentially undermining any legal justification for an emergency declaration. “But I’d rather do it much faster.”</p>\n<p>It is hard to capture in text the utter strangeness of the entire incoherent, self-defeating monologue. As always with Trump, the <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?457952-1/president-trump-sign-national-emergency-build-border-wall&amp;vod&amp;start=34\">full video</a> needs to be seen to be believed. But for those who can’t bring themselves to watch 50 minutes of the president praising himself and berating reporters, here are the most absurd highlights:</p>\n<p><strong>On other emergency declarations:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s been signed many times before. It’s been signed by other presidents. From 1977 or so, it gave the presidents the power. There’s rarely been a problem. They sign it; nobody cares. I guess they weren’t very exciting. But nobody cares. They sign it for far less important things in some cases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On executing drug dealers:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[In China] a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty. Our . . . drug dealer gets a thing called, “How about a fine?” . . .  So if we want to get smart, we can get smart. You can end the drug problem&#8212;can end it a lot faster than you think.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On Paul Ryan, who advised him against focusing on the wall:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will tell you, I’m very disappointed at certain people&#8212;particularly one&#8212;for not having pushed this faster.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On his biggest conservative fans:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Look, <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do. Not of me. If I change my views, he wouldn&#39;t be with me. <strong>Rush Limbaugh:</strong> I think he’s a great guy. Here’s a guy who could speak for three hours without a phone call. Try doing that sometime. For three hours, he speaks. He’s got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world. I mean, this guy is unbelievable. Try speaking for three hours without taking calls. Taking calls is easy. “O.K., I&#39;ll answer this one, that one.” He goes for three hours and he’s got an audience that’s fantastic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On his friendship with dictator Kim Jong Un:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was a very tough dialogue at the beginning. Fire and fury. Total annihilation. “My button is bigger than yours” and “my button works.” . . . [But] I like him a lot and he likes me a lot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On Ann Coulter, who has called his emergency declaration a scam:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ann Coulter,</strong> I don’t know her. I hardly know her. I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year. but the press loves saying “Ann Coulter.” Probably if I did speak to her, she’d be very nice. I just don’t have the time . . . I would speak to her, I have nothing against her. . . . But she&#39;s off the reservation. But anybody that knows her understands that. But I haven’t spoken to her. I don’t follow her. I don’t talk to her. But the press loves to bring up the name “Ann Coulter.” And you know what, I think she’s fine. . . . I just don’t speak to her.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On where he gets his (debunked) statistics on immigration:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I get my numbers from a lot of sources, like Homeland Security, primarily. And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster. And you know what else is a disaster? The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, <strong>Kirstjen [Nielsen],</strong> for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration. Billions and billions of dollars a month. Billions and billions of dollars and it’s unnecessary. . . . I use many stats . . . you have stats far worse than the ones I use, but I use many stats. But I also use Homeland Security.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On why he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, Part I:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think the people understand what we do. . . . Prime Minister <strong>[Shinzō] Abe</strong> [gave me]&#8212;it’s the most beautiful five-page letter. Nobel Prize. He sent it to them. You know why? Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan. And they had alarms going off&#8212;you know that. Now, all of a sudden, they feel good. They feel safe. I did that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On why he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, Part II:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you look at Idlib Province in Syria, I stopped the slaughter of perhaps three million people, nobody talk about that. . . . Russia and Iran and Syria were going to go in and perhaps destroy three million people in order to get 45,000 terrorists. And I heard about it from a woman who had her parents and her brother living there. And she said, “Please, please.” And I thought&#8212;I said, “No. It can’t happen. What are you talking about it?” “No, they’re going to. ” And I come home and I read a certain paper where the story was there, that they were actually forming to go into&#8212;to, really, to really do big destruction. And I put out a statement that, “You’d better not do it.” And in all fairness to Russia and Iran and Syria, they didn’t attack. Or they’re doing it surgically, at least. Saved a lot of people.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

Trump</strong> has jumped the gun. Last week, the Trump administration revealed plans to remove all American troops from Syria by the end of April&#8212;a position long championed by the president. The move rankled even some congressional allies like Senator <strong>Lindsey Graham,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">apparently</a> made his displeasure known to Acting Defense Secretary <strong>Patrick Shanahan</strong> over the weekend. Now, it’s clear lawmakers weren’t the only ones blindsided by the planned withdrawal&#8212;key United States allies appear to have been left out of the loop as well.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/allies-say-they-wont-remain-in-syria-after-us-troops-withdraw/2019/02/20/62e503b2-3532-11e9-a400-e481bf264fdc_story.html?utm_term=.9c6870c65501\">reported</a> that U.S. allies “unanimously” declined the Trump administration’s request to pick up the slack fighting ISIS in Syria if the U.S. removes its troops in the spring, as Trump has apparently directed Shanahan to do. A senior administration official told the <em>Post</em> that allies have made it clear they “won’t stay if you pull out.” Trump’s hasty move, then, could leave behind a powder keg. “It’s not safe to leave these enemies there, without any referee or mediating force,” said a U.S. official.</p>\n<p>His approach to Syria is the latest example of Trump’s seeming tendency to push policy without working out the details, which has frustrated even some of his closest allies. “That’s the dumbest fucking idea I’ve ever heard,” Graham evidently <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">told</a> Shanahan of Trump’s withdrawal plan in a meeting in Munich last Saturday. The South Carolina Republican, normally a staunch defender of the president, has been venting about the administration’s Syria policy since December, when Trump suddenly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/donald-trump-syria-troops\">announced</a> it would be up to other nations to fight ISIS there&#8212;despite also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1075397797929775105\">claiming</a> that the terrorist organization had been “defeated.” Graham torched the policy, saying at the time that he would “hold the administration accountable for this decision,” and threatened hearings over the planned move.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to imagine that any president would wake up and make this kind of decision with this little communication,” Republican Senator <strong>Bob Corker</strong> said at the time.</p>\n<p>But it appears that’s precisely how Trump has approached one of the most complicated foreign-policy conundrums of his presidency. While the commander-in-chief seemingly continues to talk out of his ass&#8212;on Friday, he said he would announce the “eradication of the caliphate . . . over the next 24 hours,” but no such announcement has come&#8212;U.S. allies appear to be losing patience. Last week, French Foreign Minister <strong>Jean-Yves Le Drian</strong> <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/u-s-pullout-from-syria-benefits-iran-says-french-fm-1.6938647\">called</a> Trump’s call for withdrawal a “mystery,” and British Foreign Secretary <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> has said that “there is no prospect of British forces replacing the Americans” in Syria. Their pushback has left Trump hanging. Whether it will be enough to force him to reconsider remains to be seen.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a

Trump’s</strong> efforts to build a Trump Tower in Russia during the presidential campaign, <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> appeared Friday on ABC to downplay the controversial real-estate project&#8212;and put some distance between herself and the president. Asked by <strong>Abby Huntsman</strong> whether she had any concerns about the project, the senior White House adviser <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/08/politics/ivanka-trump-russia-investigation/index.html\">responded</a> that she knew “literally almost nothing” about a Trump Organization proposal to build a skyscraper in downtown Moscow, and said she had “zero concern” that anyone in her family could be implicated in <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> investigation into Russian efforts to fix the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Of course, Ivanka’s account differs somewhat from various reports suggesting she knew a great deal about the project. According to <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/mueller-eyes-ivanka-don-jr-s-work-trump-tower-moscow-003012099.html\">Yahoo News</a>, both she and <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong> were involved in the project as far back as 2013, and were aware that former Trump lawyer <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> had been working to revive the deal. In October 2015, Trump Sr. signed a letter of intent to move forward with negotiations, but has continued to be evasive about the extent of his ambitions. In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress about the scope of the Trump Tower project, and BuzzFeed News recently reported that the president directed Cohen to say that those negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did, though the special counsel’s office issued an unusual statement disputing the BuzzFeed story as “not accurate.”</p>\n<p>According to the contested BuzzFeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation\">report</a>, both Ivanka and Trump Jr. received “regular, detailed updates” about the project from Cohen. Ivanka would reportedly have managed a spa at the tower, and per BuzzFeed, instructed Cohen to speak with a Russian athlete who had “synergy on a government level” to move the project along. A spokesperson for the First Daughter’s attorney told BuzzFeed that she was only “minimally involved” in proceedings, and “did not know about this proposal until after a non-binding letter of intent had been signed.” Her older brother, meanwhile, has testified under oath that he was only “peripherally aware” of the plans.</p>\n<p>She contested the Yahoo report too, insisting that her involvement in the project was limited to recommending an architect. But in her interview with Huntsman, she offered additional explanations: the Moscow deal was one of many she was juggling, she was too busy to have paid much attention, and it never moved beyond a theoretical stage. “There was never a binding contract,” she told Huntsman during the <em>Good Morning America</em> interview, part of which aired Friday. “I never talked to the&#8212;with a third party outside of the organization about it. It was one of&#8212;I mean, we could have had 40 or 50 deals like that, that were floating around, that somebody was looking at. Nobody visited it to see if it was worth our time. So this was not exactly like an advanced project.”</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing there, yet it’s created weeks and weeks and months of headlines,” she added. “So no, I have zero concern.”</p>\n<h3>More

There’s also the time he <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/donald-trump-fires-fbi-director-james-comey\">fired</a> the director of the F.B.I.; the private campaign to remove <strong>Jeff Sessions</strong> for failing to “protect him”; and the hiring of <strong>Rudy Giuliani,</strong> whose job has been to wage a public-relations war to “undermine the credibility of both Mr. Mueller and the Justice Department,” which has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/rudy-giuliani-robert-mueller-collusion-russia\">not worked out so well</a>. More recently, the president apparently used some precious hours of “Executive Time” to try to install a friendly face atop the investigation into his hush-money payments during the election.</p>\n<p>Last year, according to the <em>Times,</em> Trump summoned his newly installed acting attorney general, <strong>Matthew Whitaker</strong>&#8212;the one he claimed to not know despite <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/trump-denies-knowing-whitaker-who-he-met-a-dozen-times.html\">meeting with him on at least 12 separate occasions</a>&#8212;to ask him a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1068442531887632384\">very legal and very cool</a> question. Could <strong>Geoffrey Berman,</strong> the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, take over the investigation into <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-played-central-role-in-hush-payoffs-to-stormy-daniels-and-karen-mcdougal-1541786601\">Trump’s role</a> in paying porn star <strong>Stormy Daniels</strong> and former <em>Playboy</em> model <strong>Karen McDougal</strong> to keep quiet about their alleged affairs? In Berman, Trump obviously saw the perfect guy for the job, given his background as the son of a real-estate developer; his time <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/10/top-ny-prosecutor-geoffrey-berman-trump-appointee-recused-michael-cohen-inquiry/502367002/\">as a principal at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/rudy-giuliani-greenberg-traurig-resignation\">which previously employed Giuliani until the association likely became too mortifying to bear</a>; and his <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-thought-hed-picked-his-perfect-us-attorney-in-geoffrey-berman-he-was-very-wrong\">hefty donation to the Trump campaign in 2016</a>. In Whitaker, too, Trump presumably saw a guy with a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/matthew-whitaker-world-patent-marketing-scam\">somewhat elastic view of right and wrong</a>, who would be eager to do his bidding. But alas! It was not to be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Whitaker, who had privately told associates that part of his role at the Justice Department was to “jump on a grenade” for the president, knew he could not put Mr. Berman in charge because Mr. Berman had already recused himself from the investigation. The president soon soured on Mr. Whitaker, as he often does with his aides, and complained about his inability to pull levers at the Justice Department that could make the president’s many legal problems go away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The revelation not only highlights Trump’s continued reliance on <em>Sopranos</em>-esque tactics while working in the White House, but also puts Whitaker in an awkward situation vis-à-vis potentially lying to Congress:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Whitaker, who this month told a congressional committee that Mr. Trump had never pressured him over the various investigations, is now under scrutiny by House Democrats for possible perjury.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A spokeswoman for the Justice Department told the <em>Times</em> that the White House never asked Whitaker to interfere in the hush-money investigation. “Under oath to the House Judiciary Committee, then-Acting Attorney General Whitaker stated that ‘at no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel’s investigation or any other investigation,’” said <strong>Kerri Kupec.</strong> “Mr. Whitaker stands by his testimony.” Meanwhile, it will undoubtedly shock you to hear that Trump has dubbed the whole thing “fake news”:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962\">https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962</a></p></blockquote></div><h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Storms’-a-brewin","socialTitle":"Report: Trump Tried to Muzzle Investigation into His Porno Payoffs","socialDescription":"The president thought he could install a friendly face atop the probe.

still threatening to cull funds from “other sources.”","promoDek":"The president is getting even less money than before the government shutdown&#8212;but the White House is still threatening to cull funds from “other sources.”","body":"<p>In the latest blow to his deal-maker persona, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> appears poised to sign the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/congress-reaches-deal-to-fund-quarter-of-trump-border-wall\">border-security deal</a> a bipartisan panel of Capitol Hill negotiators struck late Monday, despite the fact that it allots the president <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/12/18221468/congress-border-security-deal\">less money</a> in barrier funding than he was offered last year, before he shut down the government for five weeks. The president has made clear he’s no fan of the agreement, but with no Republican appetite for a second shutdown or unilateral action by the White House, and a Friday deadline looming, he may not have much of a choice&#8212;even as he leaves open the possibility of finding “other sources” to get the sum he’s spent months demanding. “I’m not happy about it,” Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/12/trump-meeting-cant-say-happy-border-deal-remarks-ip-vpx.cnn\">told reporters</a> of the deal on Tuesday. “It’s not doing the trick. But I’m adding things to it, and when you add whatever I have to add&#8212;it’s all gonna happen where we’re gonna build a beautiful, big, strong wall.”</p>\n<p>“It’s very simple,” he said.</p>\n<p>It makes sense that Trump isn’t thrilled about the deal. It includes just $1.375 billion for border fencing&#8212;far less than the nearly $6 billion he’d been seeking to build a concrete wall, and less even than the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/418507-schumer-dems-oppose-spending-more-than-16b-on-border-security\">$1.6 billion</a> <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> had offered him before Trump shut down the government last year. For the guy who authored <em>Art of the Deal,</em> it’s unquestionably a defeat&#8212;a fact his base has already picked up on. Rep. <strong>Mark Meadows,</strong> one of Trump’s top Hill allies, said on Monday that the bill “does not represent a fraction of what the president has promised the American people” and suggested he shouldn’t sign it. <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> Trump’s Fox News id, called the funding measure a “garbage compromise” when details first emerged.</p>\n<p>But Hannity has since softened, saying he’s “not as concerned” about Trump signing what he’d previously described as an “insane” deal&#8212;as long as he also declares a national emergency to get the rest of the money for the wall. “The president would need to declare a national emergency,” Hannity <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2019/02/12/sean-hannity-says-declaring-national-emergency-border-necessity/222852\">said</a> Tuesday. “This is the time. That is a necessity.” Trump, too, has hinted that he could pull additional cash from “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1095469449052868610\">other sources</a>,” a possible reference to the nuclear option he’s been threatening for weeks. “Was just presented the concept and parameters of the Border Security Deal by hard working Senator <strong>Richard Shelby,</strong>” Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1095469447933059073\">tweeted</a> Tuesday evening. “Looking over all aspects knowing that this will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources. . . . Regardless of Wall money, it is being built as we speak!”</p>\n<p>There is more than one way for the White House to tap those “other sources,” although each comes with potential legal hurdles. As Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/11/mick-mulvaney-border-wall-funds-1163996\">reported</a> on Monday, the White House has already developed plans to redirect unspent federal dollars as part of an executive order that would bypass Congress without requiring an emergency declaration. “There are certain sums of money that are available to the president, to any president,” Chief of Staff <strong>Mick Mulvaney</strong> explained Sunday on <em>Meet the Press.</em> “So you comb through the law at the president&#39;s request . . . And there’s pots of money where presidents, all presidents, have access to without a national emergency.” Experts say the move would almost certainly provoke a challenge.</p>\n<p>For now, at least, Trump’s signature on the bipartisan border deal would avert another destructive shutdown. But it’s not a done deal just yet. While the funding measure was agreed to in principle, Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2019/02/13/is-the-border-wall-deal-in-danger-of-falling-apart-392261\">reported</a> Wednesday that lawmakers have discovered some unresolved areas of contention as they’ve worked to finalize it. That could be troublesome with a Friday deadline fast approaching&#8212;especially when the ultimate decision comes down to an unpredictable president whose whims can change with the wind.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

Republicans’ grip on the federal purse strings, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is set to bypass Congress and use the nuclear option to build his long-promised wall at the United States-Mexico border. It’s a move that will trigger a tough, protracted legal fight&#8212;and one that could even cause a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/trump-declares-national-emergency-border-wall-funding\">rift within the G.O.P.</a>, where leadership previously warned the president against an emergency declaration.</p>\n<p>Democrats, naturally, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/national-emergency-blocked-courts-temporarily-doj-warns-white/story?id=61086962\">labeled</a> the move “crazy,” “ridiculous,” and something “all of us will come to regret.” But Thursday also saw renewed cries of alarm from Republicans. Senator <strong>Susan Collins,</strong> who has criticized Trump in the past, released a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorCollins/status/1096175131733475330\">statement</a> calling the administration’s plan B a “mistake.” “Such a declaration would undermine the role of Congress and the appropriations process,” Collins said, warning of the precedent it could set. Kentucky Senator <strong>Rand Paul,</strong> a proponent of limited government, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096149684840738816\">told a reporter</a> he was “not in favor” of the plan, saying that “revenue raising and spending power was given to Congress” and suggesting that going around lawmakers would be an abuse of executive power. And Alaska Senator <strong>Lisa Murkowski,</strong> who’s stood up to the administration before, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096151375875133440\">said</a> she “[doesn’t] think this is a matter that should be declared a national emergency.”</p>\n<p>“I wish he wouldn’t have done it,” Senator <strong>Chuck Grassley</strong> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/14/gop-national-emergency-declaration-trump-1170697\">told</a> Politico. “I imagine we’ll find out whether he’s got the authority to do it by the courts.”</p>\n<p>“I never thought that was a good idea,” Republican Senator <strong>Pat Toomey</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096153688681467905\">told a reporter</a>. “I still don’t.”</p>\n<p>Trump had long suggested he’d employ the nuclear option, having previously called the bipartisan talks that led to this week’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/congress-reaches-deal-to-fund-quarter-of-trump-border-wall\">border-security agreement</a> a “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/trump-great-negotiator-gives-up-on-negotiating-border-wall-national-emergency\">waste of time</a>.” He’d even <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/republicans-think-trump-nuclear-option-national-emergency-is-a-terrible-idea\">implied</a> that he would declare a national emergency during his State of the Union address earlier this month, but ultimately decided against it amid bipartisan backlash&#8212;including from Senate Majority Leader <strong>Mitch McConnell.</strong></p>\n<p>Now, though, Trump is planning to sign the bipartisan deal <em>and</em> employ the nuclear option. That will likely please his base, including <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> who signaled this week that the only way he’d give his blessing to the “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-prepares-to-sign-garbage-compromise-on-border-wall-funding\">garbage compromise</a>” would be if the president accompanied his signature with a national emergency. It’ll also please some of his Capitol Hill allies, including <strong>Lindsey Graham,</strong> who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GarrettHaake/status/1096144722215743489\">said</a> Thursday that “this is a political fight worth having.”</p>\n<p>It remains to be seen whether pushback from lawmakers can overcome the kudos from Trump’s base. That, after all, is one of the defining problems of Republican criticisms of Trump: that his detractors, time and again, have proven far more pliable than his allies. McConnell, who had previously opposed the nuclear option, announced his support on the Senate floor Thursday. And even those who expressed concern with the maneuver seemingly left themselves wiggle room. Take <strong>Marco Rubio:</strong> the Florida Republican indicated he believes Trump may be violating the Constitution if he bypasses Congress to build the wall&#8212;but only went so far as to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenRubioPress/status/1096172609392254978\">say</a> he is “skeptical it will be something [he] can support.” “I will wait to see what statutory or constitutional power the President relies on to justify such a declaration before making any definitive statement,” he said.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and

But in declaring a national emergency, the president risks a constitutional challenge&#8212;and causing lasting damage to the institution of Congress.","body":"<p>President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> will declare a national emergency to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, the White House confirmed Thursday afternoon, shortly after Senate Majority Leader <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> strode onto the Senate floor to announce that he would support the president’s power grab. “President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action&#8212;including a national emergency&#8212;to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis,” Press Secretary <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Trump had <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-wall-national-emergency-shutdown\">long threatened</a> to use his executive authority to build the wall if Democrats refused to give him the $5.7 billion he had demanded, despite the protestations of lawmakers in his own party. McConnell himself <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/mcconnell-privately-cautioned-trump-about-emergency-declaration-on-border-wall/2019/02/01/5ff1262c-2646-11e9-81fd-b7b05d5bed90_story.html\">previously warned</a> the president against declaring a national emergency, concerned it would split the Republican Party. In <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-01/trump-hints-he-ll-discuss-border-emergency-at-state-of-union\">recent days</a>, Trump reportedly convened his staff and advisers to begin drafting a national-emergency declaration for the wall, as it became clear that the omnibus budget would not include money for his signature campaign promise; the latest iteration allocated just $1.375 billion for 55 miles of barriers, fencing, and other security measures. Conservatives, including some of Trump’s top allies on Capitol Hill, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-prepares-to-sign-garbage-compromise-on-border-wall-funding\">panned the deal</a>. Fox News host <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> perhaps the president’s most influential outside adviser, called it a “garbage compromise.”</p>\n<p>The president’s inability to build the wall, even when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, has been a continuing personal embarrassment. By declaring a national emergency, Trump can appease his base and save face&#8212;but he also risks a massive court battle. The move will likely trigger a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/01/trump-has-no-case-national-emergency/581356/\">constitutional challenge</a>, as it directly circumvents Congress’s power of the purse to address an emergency wholly manufactured by the president. Despite Trump’s insistence that there is a crisis at the border, illegal border crossings are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/11/us/politics/trump-border-crisis-reality.html\">down substantially</a> over the last two decades. While there is a very real <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-theres-a-crisis-at-the-border-heres-what-the-data-says\">asylum crisis</a> at the border, the vast majority of people seeking refuge in the United States, such as members of several recent “caravans,” typically present themselves at ports of entry in order to apply for protected status.</p>\n<p>Legal experts believe <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/trump-national-emergency.html?module=inline\">Trump could win</a> a court challenge over his authority to militarize border-wall construction, and the White House has been preparing for that eventuality. Asked Thursday if they are prepared to litigate a national-emergency declaration, Sanders said, “We’re very prepared, but there shouldn’t be [legal challenges]. The president’s doing his job. Congress should do theirs.”</p>\n<p>The larger problem identified by Republican critics is the precedent Trump would set by usurping Congress. After all, if Trump can decide that something qualifies as an emergency when he doesn’t get his way, what’s to stop a future Democratic president from deciding that something like climate change&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">an actual, global threat to humanity</a>&#8212;can be addressed by executive fiat? Trump himself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/535441553079431168\">tweeted</a> in 2014, “Repubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit &amp; because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, shortly after Sanders confirmed Trump’s intent to declare an emergency, House Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> issued a stark warning to Republicans. “Just think what a president with different values can present to the American people,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/politico/status/1096153922228703233\">she said</a> during a press conference Thursday. “You want to talk about a national emergency? Let’s talk about today, the one-year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America. That’s a national emergency. Why don’t you declare that an emergency, Mr. President? I wish you would, but a Democratic president can do that. A Democratic president can declare other emergencies as well.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Emergency Wall","socialTitle":"Trump Chooses the Nuclear Option to Build His Border Wall","socialDescription":"The president hopes to save face after a stinging legislative defeat.

The choice made sense. Clinton was the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, traversing battleground states to shore up voters and delegates and sell the exact kinds of qualities that would make someone among Americans’ most respected people. That this was the 20th time that Clinton topped the list&#8212;since 1993&#8212;is a testament to the role she has played in the modern fabric of American politics. (Only Eleanor Roosevelt, with 13 years atop the list, and Margaret Thatcher, who bested the rest six times, come close to Clinton’s Gallup reign.)\n<p>To be sure, there are a good many Americans who do not feel such affection for Clinton. As First Lady for eight years, she forgave her husband, Bill, for cheating with an intern, covering up the affair, and being impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice. After the Clintons left the White House for New York, she voted in favor of the Iraq war&#8212;a decision that has since raised questions about her hawkish judgement. She lost her 2008 bid for the White House, which some assumed she’d win handily, to a first-term community organizer turned senator from Chicago. And when that newcomer took office as the 44th president and named her secretary of state, she hosted her work e-mails on a private server and took responsibility for a 2012 security breach in Benghazi that led to the death of four Americans.</p>\n<p>But the Wellesley- and Yale-educated lawyer, champion for women’s rights, advocate for children, and well-regarded glass-ceiling smasher finally seems as though she is headed back to the Oval Office, on her own terms. After a drawn-out primary process with Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton appears to have locked up enough super-delegates to win the nomination.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/574325b6614dc9a45cb0a2b0_hive-contributor-profile-hillary-clinton.jpg","width":1400,"height":700},"16:9":{"width":1232,"height":693,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":84,"width":1232,"height":693}}},"9:16":{"width":387,"height":688,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":506,"width":387,"height":688}}},"1:1":{"width":700,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":350,"width":700,"height":700}}},"3:2":{"width":1050,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":350,"height":700,"width":1050}}},"2:3":{"width":466,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":467,"width":466,"height":699}}},"4:3":{"width":932,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":234,"width":932,"height":699}}},"5:3":{"width":1165,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":117,"width":1165,"height":699}}},"7:3":{"width":1400,"height":600,"modifications":{"crop":{"width":1400,"height":600}}}},"revisionCreatedAt":"July 25, 2017 1:45 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Aminata Dia","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-hillary-clinton.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-hillary-clinton.jpg","tags":[],"credit":"By Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574325b5c1f81aa45c8117d7","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 11:45 am","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"July 25, 2017 1:45 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 513012906","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/hillary-clinton","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/574325b6614dc9a45cb0a2b0_hive-contributor-profile-hillary-clinton.jpg","width":1400,"height":700},"16:9":{"width":1232,"height":693,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":84,"width":1232,"height":693}}},"9:16":{"width":387,"height":688,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":506,"width":387,"height":688}}},"1:1":{"width":700,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":350,"width":700,"height":700}}},"3:2":{"width":1050,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":350,"height":700,"width":1050}}},"2:3":{"width":466,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":467,"width":466,"height":699}}},"4:3":{"width":932,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":234,"width":932,"height":699}}},"5:3":{"width":1165,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":117,"width":1165,"height":699}}},"7:3":{"width":1400,"height":600,"modifications":{"crop":{"width":1400,"height":600}}}},"revisionCreatedAt":"July 25, 2017 1:45 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Aminata Dia","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-hillary-clinton.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-hillary-clinton.jpg","tags":[],"credit":"By Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574325b5c1f81aa45c8117d7","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 11:45 am","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"July 25, 2017 1:45 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 513012906","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"5743260055f979a31fa98971","revision":4,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/hillary-clinton"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"“Take Her at Her Word”: Hillary Allies Address the 2020 Rumors","promoHed":"“Take Her at Her Word”: Hillary Allies Address the 2020 Rumors","dek":"John Podesta offers more “media catnip.”","promoDek":"John Podesta offers more “media catnip.”","body":"<p>In October, <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> told <strong>Kara Swisher</strong> she would “like to be president,” spawning <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/us/politics/hillary-clinton-run-president.html\">dozens of headlines</a> in publications that gamed out the viability of a potential 2020 bid. To hear the press tell it, she was “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/well-id-like-to-be-president-hillary-clinton-sends-mixed-signals-on-a-2020-white-house-bid/2018/10/29/d17257a0-db6c-11e8-85df-7a6b4d25cfbb_story.html\">sending mixed signals</a>,” and “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/413572-hillary-clinton-leaves-door-open-for-2020-run-id-like-to-be-president\">leaving the door open</a>,” characterizations Swisher herself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1056924474367533059\">took issue with</a>. Yet for some reason, rumors continue to swirl around Clinton, inspired by an errant word from a longtime adviser <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/10/19/hillary-clinton-democrats-go-away-2018-2020-221608\">here</a>, a trolling <em>Wall Street Journal</em> op-ed <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-will-run-again-1541963599?ns=prod/accounts-wsj\">there</a>. Most recently, CNN’s <strong>Jeff Zeleny</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/27/politics/inside-politics-forecast-cnntv/index.html\">reported</a> on that Clinton was once again floating a candidacy to her friends: “[S]he was telling people that look, given all this news from the indictments, particularly the <strong>Roger Stone</strong> indictment, she talked to several people, saying ‘look, I’m not closing the doors to this,’” he said, adding that other associates still were dubious. (Said one: “it would surprise me greatly if she actually did it.”)</p>\n<p>This, said <strong>John Podesta,</strong> Clinton’s 2016 campaign manager, is nonsense. “Look, first of all, I love her, I wish she was president, she got 3 million more votes than <strong>Donald Trump</strong> did, she would have been a great president,” he <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2020-presidential-election-hillary-clinton-not-running-podesta-070ef325-dd68-480e-98ea-99ebd619d047.html\">said</a> on CNN Tuesday. “But she says she’s not running for president.”</p>\n<p>“I take her at her word,” he continued, adding that the Democratic Party has “got a lot of great candidates out there right now, and I think the Democratic primary”&#8212;already a crowded affair&#8212;”is going to be a spirited one with a lot of great ideas coming forward.” He dismissed the narrative that Clinton was mulling another presidential run as “media catnip.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, there seems to be something irresistible to the media in the idea of Clinton resurfacing. Perhaps it’s simply difficult to imagine that arguably the most qualified candidate to ever run for president is content at the prospect of spending her days <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/deals/gl-lnc-the-clintons-la-2019\">selling speaking tour tickets on Groupon</a>, or even, as Podesta described, visiting Puerto Rico to “help the people that Donald Trump has abandoned” as the island recovers from Hurricane Maria. Whatever the reason, each new story in the genre is met with an inevitable backlash. The response to the <em>Journal</em> op-ed is a prime example: “Please, Hillary, Don’t Do It,” two CNN contributors <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/opinions/hillary-2020-prospect-opinion-honan-wierson/index.html\">wrote in panicked response</a>, while <strong>Chris Cilizza</strong> devoted <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T9hcFrD6Ns\">six-and-a-half minutes</a> to calling it a “terrible idea,” and <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/no-hillary-clinton-wont-be-the-2020-democratic-nominee.html\">countless</a> <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/a-request-to-mark-penn-andy-stein-and-any-other-so-called-democrats-talking-up-clinton-2020-respectfully-shut-up\">hot</a> <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/807216/hillary-2020-cannot-serious\">takes</a> <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/418137-foxs-pirro-to-clinton-on-2020-the-only-place-that-you-need-to-run-is-back-into\">emerged</a> panning possibility. (The one exception was Trump White House adviser <strong>Kellyanne Conway,</strong> who tweeted: <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/conway-jokes-about-prediction-hillary-clinton-will-run-again-in-2020-1.6640531\">“Dear God, please, yes.”</a>)</p>\n<p>But the myth of Clinton as leader-in-exile will persist as long as she remains a public figure, buoyed both by people who believe she would’ve won in 2016 save for a few targeted Russian hacks, and by those who see rumors about her potential run as a characteristic display of unalloyed ambition and hubris. The Clinton persona has become symbolic of the rift in the Democratic Party that paved the way for Trumpism, and rumors of her return are all but guaranteed to trigger meltdowns.</p>\n<h3>More Great

But that doesn’t mean that no woman will pass it, or that disliking a certain woman stems solely from misogyny.","body":"<p>From time to time, the political press propagates a thought that, whatever its validity, dominates the discourse. It’s akin to a spontaneous combustion, and the truism it produces lasts until the next one comes along. As in: <strong>Amy Klobuchar’s</strong> two-and-a-half-minute exchange with <strong>Brett Kavanaugh</strong> about his drinking habits gave instant rise to the widespread conclusion that she should be the Democratic nominee.</p>\n<p>And no sooner had <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> entered the race in late December than the question of whether she’s “likable” was immediately interpreted as misogynistic.</p>\n<p>Warren’s talents as a campaigner were evident in her foray into Iowa during the first week of January. She’s quite skilled at drilling down to a simple, comprehensible point, usually having to do with economic justice. Her anecdotes go over well. For example, in Iowa she told the story of getting in touch with Iowa Republican Senator <strong>Chuck Grassley,</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/bipartisan-over-the-counter-hearing-aid-legislation-to-become-law\">working with him</a> to get a bill through Congress that lowered the cost of hearing aids. (Cheers and applause.) She’s earned bragging rights for having spawned the idea&#8212;before she entered the Senate&#8212;of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to protect individuals from scams in credit cards, mortgages, and loans. The new agency was relatively successful, until the Trump administration took over and began to de-fang it.</p>\n<p>But there’s another aspect to Warren’s economic populism&#8212;one that makes her less than popular among her Senate colleagues. This friction has nothing to do with Warren being a woman in politics, or displaying political ambition&#8212;just as much of what bothered people about <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> had nothing to do with her gender. For an explanation of what it is about Warren that perturbs her colleagues, I sought out an observant former Senate Democratic aide of many years’ standing. What he said echoed comments and stories I’d heard from senators and reporters who’ve dealt with Warren. “She projects a ‘holier than thou’ attitude that her colleagues find irritating. She’s very doctrinaire. She’s somewhat ‘My way or the highway’&#8212;not as much as <strong>Bernie Sanders,</strong> but up there,” he said. “She has a moralizing to her . . . She rails against Wall Street, which may be appealing to some people, but it’s too simplistic to work as an analysis. But she’s very good at finding issues that resonate with middle Americans,” he added, citing the hearing-aid story. He went on: “She’s a little aloof; she’s strong in her convictions, unwilling to bend.”</p>\n<p>He then offered a comparison between Warren and Clinton as senators. Of Warren he said, “She’s never tried very hard to make friends there. Compare that to Hillary: She knew coming into the Senate that she was viewed by many there as the devil incarnate, and she kept her head down and worked to make friends on both sides of the aisle.”</p>\n<p>Of course, despite her best efforts, the “unlikable” tag has also been attached to Clinton. What bothered many people (women, as well as men) about Clinton was that she gave off an attitude of entitlement&#8212;the tin ear and air of superiority that led her to label half of <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> supporters “a basket of deplorables.” That misogyny dogged Clinton is without question, but some of her own personality traits were responsible for the way she was seen by a substantial segment of the public.</p>\n<p>The fact that Warren’s likability, like Clinton’s, has been questioned has led numerous observers to conclude that no woman in politics can overcome criticism based on her gender. That’s nonsense. After all, a <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/12/18/record-number-women-in-congress/\">record</a> 102 women were elected to the House of Representatives in 2018. (The previous House record was 85 women.) Republicans simply haven’t made the same effort that Democrats have to bring women into their ranks, with the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/12/18/record-number-women-in-congress/\">result</a> that women now represent 8 percent of House Republicans, as opposed to 38 percent of the Democratic caucus. (Democrats also stressed diversity, and sought out candidates of both genders who’d served in the military.) In the Senate, midterms plus the appointment to fill the remainder of John McCain’s term, added 15 women, for a total of 25 women senators; previously, the <a href=\"http://cawp.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/resources/results_release_5bletterhead5d_1.pdf\">record</a> was 23. Two incumbent women senators lost to men on clear substantive issues. Midterms also saw women pick up gubernatorial seats, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/opinion/election-michigan-women-stabenow-whitmer.html\">four of the top statewide offices</a> in Michigan. A black woman fell just short of winning the governorship of Georgia, overtaken at least in part by the fact that her opponent was also the secretary of state who set and twisted the rules of the race. The direction is clear. A country that couldn’t see women through other than a misogynistic lens wouldn’t produce such results.</p>\n<p>Another way to look at Warren’s situation in Congress is to compare it to that of <strong>Nancy Pelosi,</strong> as House Speaker far and away the most powerful woman on Capitol Hill, if not in all of Washington. Despite the attacks on her in national politics&#8212;the right charges her with being a “San Francisco liberal,” though in fact she’s a product of the brass-knuckle politics of Baltimore, where her father was the boss-mayor&#8212;Pelosi’s colleagues don’t raise the issue of her likability. Under pressure from their Republican opponents, some Democrats running for the House for the first time pledged not to support her for Speaker (though not all of them held to this promise). But no serious challenge developed. It was clear, as she skillfully dispatched possible rivals&#8212;who said it was time for fresh blood in the Democratic leadership&#8212;that Pelosi is admired by most of the men as well as the women in the Democratic caucus for her legislative smarts and her toughness wrapped in a certain grace. Several said that Pelosi was just who was needed to deal with Donald Trump. She met the argument of those who said she should make way for younger leadership by agreeing to step down from the Speakership after four more years. The contrasting cases of Warren and Pelosi show that people&#8212;both men and women&#8212;are capable of making distinctions among women in politics.</p>\n<p>The question arises: What does likability matter in politics? Does it&#8212;should it&#8212;matter at all, if someone can get elected? In fact, it counts for a lot in determining whether a political figure can work effectively with others&#8212;whether she or he can build coalitions&#8212;or can lead the public. A politician whom large numbers of people find grating simply has a harder time leading the country. This is one reason I don’t complain about the length of presidential campaigns: It usually helps sort out who will wear well. Usually. The fact that Trump is disliked by a majority of the country has been one factor getting in the way of his possible effectiveness.</p>\n<p>It’s undeniable that, while women have been making headlong progress in politics, as well as in some other professional fields, they still carry an extra burden. The double standard still exists: A man who speaks out strongly or objects to something a male boss has done is “strong,” “tough.” A woman who does the same thing is likely to be termed “difficult.” That word, “difficult,” stated or insinuated, haunts women in the workplace. Fortunately, an increasing proportion of men have enough inner strength or are sufficiently enlightened that they deal with women the same way they do men. Sexism in the workplace and in politics may be fading, but not quickly enough.</p>\n<p>At least for a while longer, women in certain fields will endure a different kind of test than men do&#8212;or an additional one. But that doesn’t mean that no woman will pass it, that it’s the only test applied to women candidates, that people can’t make distinctions, or that disliking a certain woman stems solely from misogyny. Nor does it mean that, like men, women can’t find a female candidate wanting on other grounds.</p>\n<p>Misogyny can certainly affect women in politics, but they’ll also be judged on other factors on a case-by-case basis. Other female candidates warming up for the race warrant scrutiny for other traits. Ultimately, candidates of both genders must grapple with the valid question of “likability,” which will help answer a far more important question: How will they govern?</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The real story behind the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/the-real-story-behind-the-havana-embassy-mystery?inline\">Havana embassy sonic “attacks”</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Meet 2019’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/politics-power-players-portfolio?inline\">political power players</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is the left lane big enough for both <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/why-bernie-sanders-and-elizabeth-warren-are-the-closest-of-frenemies?inline\">Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; What the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/what-the-left-can-learn-from-the-maga-cult?inline\">left can learn from MAGA</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The pop-culture releases that will <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/pop-culture-shows-movies-2019?inline\">save us in 2019</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Elizabeth Warren","socialTitle":"“She Has a Moralizing to Her”: Is Elizabeth Warren Actually “Unlikeable?”","socialDescription":"Women in certain fields endure a different kind of test than men do—or an additional one.

Unlike <strong>Corey Lewandowski,</strong> who was hired to great consternation during the 2016 election cycle (and then terminated), Flores won’t simply be an ideological talking head&#8212;she’ll be playing a larger role in the editorial process. Despite a lack of journalism experience, she will <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/media/reliable-sources-02-19-19/\">be helping</a> to coordinate CNN’s political coverage across platforms, as well as <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/19/sessions-sarah-isgur-cnn-political-editor-1174527\">occasionally appearing on-air</a> as a political analyst, which is the more customary role for former politicians and government officials. Within the media world, she is seen as a controversial and unorthodox appointment. Moreover, Isgur apparently has a history of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/19/18231993/cnn-gop-operative-2020-election-coverage\">lambasting the mainstream media</a> on Twitter, including CNN, which she once termed the “Clinton News Network.”</p>\n<p>All of this has led to a fair amount of bafflement as to why CNN would hire her in a senior editorial role reporting to political director <strong>David Chalian.</strong> “Why CNN made this move to begin with is the deeper and more troubling question,” <strong>Margaret Sullivan</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/cnns-hiring-of-a-gop-operative-as-political-editor-is-even-worse-than-it-looks/2019/02/20/93d03fa4-350b-11e9-854a-7a14d7fec96a_story.html\">wrote</a> Wednesday in <em>The Washington Post.</em></p>\n<p>As far as how the talks came about in the first place, it appears that Isgur, as she was preparing to exit the D.O.J., wasn’t only shopping around for a media gig at CNN. Cable-news sources told me that she also passed through 30 Rock to discuss a potential role at MSNBC, where she met with top newsroom management in recent months. “She had a detailed idea of what she wanted to do,” someone with knowledge of the discussions told me. “She wanted to do something on-air combined with some sort of quasi-management, behind-the-scenes planning kind of work. I think she looked at Dave Chalian and said, I wanna do that.” A second source with direct knowledge of the talks said that such a role “was never under consideration.” This person added, “She was pitching her intimate knowledge of the Mueller probe as a selling point.” (CNN has said that Isgur will have no role in any coverage related to Mueller or the Department of Justice.) MSNBC declined to comment, and CNN didn’t immediately have a comment. Isgur didn’t immediately return an e-mail, but after this article was initially published, a source close to her provided a different characterization, saying that anything related to Mueller was always off the table in Isgur&#39;s conversations with both MSNBC and CNN.</p>\n<p>My CNN sources corroborated the general sentiment that’s been conveyed in <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/media/reliable-sources-02-19-19/\">other</a> news <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnn-staffers-demoralized-by-hiring-of-gop-operative-sarah-isgur-to-oversee-2020-coverage\">reports</a> about the episode: that journalists at the network are concerned and confused about the hire. “It’s perplexing to a lot of people,” one of them told me. But in a <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnn-defends-hiring-former-gop-operative-as-political-editor\">memo</a> to employees on Wednesday, three top CNN managers&#8212;Chalian, Washington bureau chief <strong>Sam Feist,</strong> and senior vice president of newsgathering <strong>Virginia Mosley</strong>&#8212;stood by the decision, saying they were “thrilled” that Isgur was joining the network next month. “With more than two dozen candidates to cover, constant coordination is needed more than ever,” they wrote.</p>\n<p>Likewise, unnamed CNN executives defended the move to <strong>Brian Stelter,</strong> the network’s chief media correspondent. “They described her [as] an exceptional person whose political experience will improve CNN’s coverage,” Stelter <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/media/reliable-sources-02-19-19/\">wrote</a>. “The fact is, political insiders have been joining newsrooms for decades. The executives pointed to past examples like <strong>George Stephanopoulos,</strong> who went from [the] Clinton White House to the ABC News anchor chair.” A CNN source added to me, “She is super-smart, has experience in the media, is a spokesperson who understands the media&#8212;seems like these are all good characteristics.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity

On Tuesday evening, <strong>Hillary</strong> and <strong>Bill Clinton,</strong> among a slew of other famous names, headed to the Samuel J.

politicians.","body":"<p>Please set your rearview mirror to 1992. Boyz II Men’s “End of the Road” spent 13 weeks at the top of the Billboard charts, teens looked to Seattle for fashion inspiration, and <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> claimed he didn’t inhale. Yes, looking back, it’s hard to believe, both the Seattle thing and the fact that a presidential hopeful admitted he tried a marijuana cigarette during his youth&#8212;but claimed the smoke never hit his lungs.</p>\n<p>That was more than a quarter-century ago. Sometimes progress looks like a heart monitor attached to a healthy human&#8212;up and back, up and back, ever forward, never changing. But here now, in 2019, a presidential hopeful can say, “Of course.” Of course she inhaled. And she can say it while laughing a lot with an incredibly popular radio host on an incredibly popular morning show.</p>\n<p>When asked Monday morning about her youthful weed consumption on <em>The Breakfast Club,</em> Senator <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> told D.J. <strong>Charlamagne tha God,</strong> “I joke about it&#8212;half my family is from Jamaica, are you kidding me?” she said, referring to her father’s relatives, near the end of her 40-minute interview. “And I inhaled,” she said, giggling. “I did inhale. It was a long time ago,” adding later, “I think it gives a lot of people joy. We need more joy in the world.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed block video row\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><iframe height=\"315\" width=\"560\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kh_wQUjeaTk\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"> </iframe></div></div><p>Many people in elected posts have copped to using marijuana. The brothers Bush, <strong>Al Gore,</strong> and <strong>Barack Obama</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/20/politics/politicians-marijuana-talk-about-getting-high-420/index.html\">are just a few</a>. Obama said at a conference for magazine editors in 2008, “When I was a kid, I inhaled frequently. That was the point.” Even human bunion <strong>Newt Gingrich</strong> has said as much: “That was a sign we were alive and in graduate school in that era [circa 1968].” Rather than just seeking “thank you for your candor” points, however, Harris is normalizing use of the drug in an effort to legalize it. In 2017, Harris backed the Marijuana Justice Act, which fellow presidential candidate Senator <strong>Cory Booker</strong> introduced.</p>\n<p>Booker himself broke some news on <em>The Breakfast Club</em> last week. When asking about whether the senator has a girlfriend, Charlamagne was able to extract the words “I got a boo” from the senator, a reference to his <a href=\"https://people.com/politics/cory-booker-says-he-has-a-girlfriend/\">secretly-not-secret girlfriend, <strong>Rosario Dawson</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The host is also credited with getting one of the most genuinely delightful interviews from <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> during her presidential campaign. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/18/hillary-clinton-joins-the-breakfast-club-to-talk-beyonce-hot-sauce-in-her-bag-swag/?utm_term=.8e27e77c2483\">In April 2016</a>, he playfully accused her of “pandering to black people” by claiming to carry hot sauce in her bag for years. “Is it working?” she asked.

Earlier in the season, we were chasing a solution that was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/true-detective-who-is-the-killer-amelia-season-3-episode-3-the-big-never\">close to home</a> for the Hays family, but now something much more complicated and juicy has emerged. Enter: Gerald Kindt.</p>\n<h2>ARKANSAS ATTORNEY GENERAL GERALD KINDT</h2>\n<p>One of the most striking scenes in Episode 5 saw Tom Purcell hunched over what is likely a recording of his adult daughter, Julie. Taken at face value, the audio is damning to Tom. Julie accuses her father of hurting Will and taking her. But what does she <em>really</em> say?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I saw him on the television. Make him leave me alone. Tell him to\nleave me alone. I know what he did. The man on TV acting like my\nfather. Where’s my brother, Will? I don’t know what he did with him.\nWe left him resting. He took me and I’m never coming back. Just leave\nme alone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All season, <em>True Detective</em> has been fond of vague pronouns as misdirect to keep the audience guessing. Up until Episode 5, Brett Woodard was referred to as “a Man” in the 1990 timeline simply so we wouldn’t be able to track who was convicted in the Purcell case in 1990. Similarly, here, Julie (if that’s who it is) seems to be talking about Tom, but she <em>could</em> be talking about someone else she saw on the TV. She only says someone is <em>acting</em> like her father. In other words, she could be talking about Gerald Kindt.</p>\n<p>Is Kindt her real father? Not necessarily. Though who knows? We know Lucy slept around, we know the rumors about when Julie was born. But Julie was tiny when she was taken and it’s unclear what she remembers about her life before 1980. More important, there have been indications that someone on the law-and-order side of things has been tampering with the case, which brings us to . . .</p>\n<h2>OFFICER HARRIS JAMES</h2>\n<p>James gets name-dropped in this episode as someone who went missing when the case was reopened in 1990, and several clues&#8212;including a suspiciously familiar ghost in Wayne’s study&#8212;indicate that perhaps Wayne and Roland had something to do with his disappearance. In fact, the show is implying they killed him&#8212;we don’t know why. Most pertinently, Harris James is the officer on the scene at the Woodard house back in 1980 who makes the connection between a bright red backpack and Will Purcell. If the Purcell evidence <em>was</em> planted at the scene in the 80s, Harris could have easily been the one to do it.</p>\n<p>We also know that a key set of fingerprints has gone missing from the case file and a mysterious someone&#8212;either a real cop or someone impersonating one&#8212;has been making inquiries around the neighborhood. It feels likely that James would be acting on the orders of someone higher up, and who better to turn up the heat than a powerful man like Gerald Kindt. One more detail about the Harris angle: in the 2015 story line, Wayne and Roland discuss the fact that Hoyt came to visit Wayne (likely) after Harris James died. Which brings us to . . .</p>\n<h2>HOYT FOODS</h2>\n<p>It’s useful to think of real-world parallels when chewing over this next part, which links Attorney General Gerald Kindt to Lucy Purcell’s old employer: Hoyt Foods. This massive company, which seems to employ many of the Arkansas locals, is a clear stand-in for the real-life Tyson Foods. Both companies are based in Arkansas and got their start with chicken. Tyson Foods has been in the news a good deal lately for <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/01/29/tyson-chicken-recall-rubber-may-contaminate-nuggets-usda-says/2717993002/\">various</a> unsavory <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/poultry-workers-denied-bathroom-breaks-wear-diapers-oxfam-report-n572806\">reasons</a>, but the company was in the news a good deal in the late 70s, 80s, and 90s for its connection to Arkansas’s real attorney general-turned-president: <strong>Bill Clinton.</strong></p>\n<p>The show has already made a few connections between Kindt and Clinton. For one, Clinton <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bypWnBR47Rk\"><em>very</em> famously appeared</a> on <em>The Phil Donahue Show</em> in 1992 and self-righteously clutched his pearls when host <strong>Phil Donahue</strong> dared question the stability of the Clinton marriage. The would-be president got thunderous applause. Kindt also makes a <em>Donahue</em> appearance.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to be an expert in all things Clinton or Arkansas to know that the politician and the state enjoyed an especially messy entanglement between politics and big business in the 80s and 90s. (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/timeline.htm?noredirect=on\">Whitewater, anyone?</a>) Tyson Foods C.E.O. Don Tyson had a very cozy relationship with the Clintons. A 1992 <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/03/22/in-arkansas-the-game-is-chicken/6244e0fa-5416-4a6a-bae8-a229b854ed98/?utm_term=.fb189aeea3eb\">Washington Post</a></em> report opened with this evocative lede: “Don Tyson kills 25 million chickens a week on his assembly lines, 10 times as many birds as there are people in Arkansas.” Further down the page: “It would be an overstatement to say that Clinton and Tyson could not have succeeded without each other&#8212;for the most part their relationship has been of mutual benefit, helping Tyson expand his operations and Clinton ascend politically.” In 1994, <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/31/magazine/the-president-s-past.html\">The New York Times</a></em> further investigated the connection:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“[Clinton] was young and he was impressive,” Tyson recalls. “I don’t\nbelieve we ever talked about his politics; hell, he was a Democrat.”\nTyson put a modest sum of money on Clinton in his yearling race, a\ncongressional run in 1974. Although Clinton lost that election, he\nshowed excellent form, and Tyson backed him again in his successful\n1976 run for state attorney general; and again in 1978, when the\n32-year-old ran as the overwhelming favorite for governor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tyson’s support came with what appears to have been a lot of <a href=\"https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/02/02/Why-37-Year-Old-Clinton-Financial-Scandal-Still-Relevant\">leniency and kickbacks</a> from the Clinton administration and even messier entanglements including, what else, an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/18/us/top-arkansas-lawyer-helped-hillary-clinton-turn-big-profit.html\">investment scandal</a> for <strong>Hillary Clinton.</strong></p>\n<p>Before you start any silly “lock them up” chants, let’s focus back on <em>True Detective.</em> It’s safe to assume the show could easily connect the shadowy billionaire owner of Hoyt Foods with Gerald Kindt. And if he’s involved somehow, everything Hoyt has done so far to stymy both the 1980 investigation and the 1990 re-investigation makes sense. But what on earth is the motivation here?</p>\n<p>Some eagle-eyed Redditors noticed a connection between a portrait of Hoyt’s daughter and missing granddaughter in Episode 3 and a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZinAVMvdI8\">behind-the-scenes shot</a> of Devil’s Den in a video HBO released about shooting the show in Arkansas. It’s easy enough to imagine a scenario where Hoyt’s daughter&#8212;driven mad with grief over having lost her own daughter&#8212;might snatch Julie Purcell. Will would be collateral damage. Almost every investigator agrees Will’s death looked like an accident. Perhaps he cracked his head open trying to get his sister back. Perhaps Hoyt’s daughter lured Julie and Will into the woods with shiny toys, corn-husk dolls, and elaborate fantasies about being a secret princess. Perhaps this is the mysterious white woman many Arkansas locals spotted in a fancy brown car. Wouldn’t a chicken heiress drive a fancy car? But did she do it alone?</p>\n<h2>SAM WHITEHEAD</h2>\n<p>All reports of that shifty-looking white woman also mention a black man with a scar or “dead eye” along with her. When questioned about it, Sam brings up the killing line at Hoyt Foods as a likely place for someone to get injured. A one point, Wayne suggests they cross-reference the fingerprints found on the toys in the woods with the men who have been injured at Hoyt Foods. He might be onto something there. Hell, it might even be Sam himself. But that’s not all.</p>\n<h2>LUCY PURCELL</h2>\n<p>In this week’s episode, Wayne draws a connection between Lucy Purcell and the ransom note. Both use the phrase “children should laugh.” He suggests maybe she just wrote the ransom to calm Tom down and ensure he would stop worrying about Julie. But did she do that of her own accord? Out of concern for Tom? Unlikely. A compelling theory is that Lucy was somehow involved in the disappearance of the kids and that maybe, just maybe, she willingly sold them to Hoyt&#8212;her former employer. Maybe her cousin Dan helped her do it. Maybe she genuinely convinced herself that Will and Julie would have a better life with such a rich family. Certainly she didn’t think Will would die. That never seemed to be part of anyone’s plan.</p>\n<p>Did Lucy sleep with Kindt? Is he the real father? Does that embolden him to act on behalf of the Hoyt family? Oh, maybe. If we’re making real-life comparisons already, then we might as well mention “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/08/01/republicans-differ-on-whether-troopergate-remains-a-scandal-for-clinton/?utm_term=.78ccc8b75d96\">Troopergate</a>” and Bill Clinton’s particular sexual appetites when he held high office in Arkansas. In Episode 4, Amelia overhears Lucy wrapping up a call: “Don’t call,” Lucy says. “Who the fuck do you think you’re talking to, motherfucker? Huh? Hello? Hello?” She then tells Amelia that theirs was “not a happy home” (no duh) and that all she could hope for was that her kids would have a better life than she did. But that she messed that up.</p>\n<p>It’s not concrete proof by any stretch, but here’s one more piece of compelling evidence from a <a href=\"https://megaphone.link/PPY3889133426\"><em>Still Watching: True Detective</em></a> listener. Lucy, Tom, Will, and Julie Purcell all shared an unhappy home on Shoepick Lane. (The camera has lingered on that street sign more than once.) In <strong>Nic Pizzolatto’s</strong> home state of Louisiana, there’s an alternative name for bowfins, which are considered largely flavorless, “trash” fish. The Cajuns call them “choupiques,” pronounced guess how?</p>\n<p>Intriguingly, choupiques are <a href=\"https://www.houmatoday.com/entertainment/20090405/choupique-may-be-a-trash-fish-for-some-treasure-to-others\">commercially harvested</a> for their roe to produce Cajun caviar. A “trash” fish with extremely valuable eggs?

Despite efforts to project a manly ardor, the current leader of the free world spends most of his free time tweeting, calling friends, and watching Fox News. Of his <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/how-much-time-trump-spending-trump-properties-n753366\">745 days in office</a>, Trump has spent 222 days unwinding at Trump-branded properties and 168 days golfing. According to the testimony of numerous West Wing staffers, he struggles to focus in meetings, largely ignores intelligence briefings, and tunes out policy minutiae. Once, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/absolutely-out-of-control-cliff-simss-book-depicts-life-in-trumps-white-house/2019/01/21/883d2412-1d92-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html?utm_term=.ba9c2ccede7a\">according</a> to former White House aide <strong>Cliff Sims,</strong> Trump literally got up and wandered away while <strong>Paul Ryan</strong> was in the Oval Office attempting to explain the Republican health-care bill. While Ryan was still talking, Trump walked down the hall to his private dining room and turned on the TV.</p>\n<p>We’ve known since January 2018 that White House staffers have an official designation for these unstructured periods on Trump’s private schedule: “<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/scoop-trumps-secret-shrinking-schedule-1515364904-ab76374a-6252-4570-a804-942b3f851840.html\">Executive Time</a>.” What we didn’t know is exactly how much of the president’s average day is spent un-presidenting.</p>\n<p>In fact, “Executive Time” is far more than just a respite from the duties of the office. In perhaps the most remarkable White House leak this year, Axios on Sunday published about <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-private-schedules-leak-executive-time-34e67fbb-3af6-48df-aefb-52e02c334255.html\">three months’ worth</a> of Trump’s private daily schedules, dating back to the day after the midterm elections. They reveal that Trump has spent around 297 hours&#8212;or roughly 60 percent of his waking hours since the midterms&#8212;in “Executive Time.” For comparison, he’s only spent about 77 hours in meetings&#8212;less time than his travel (51 hours) and eating lunch (39 hours) combined.</p>\n<p>Leaks are endemic to the Trump administration, but this one has especially rattled an already paranoid White House. “If most [leaks] are involuntary manslaughter,” Sims <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/white-house-reaction-trump-private-schedules-leak-a0c23dc5-ad34-47f5-830f-1bc496398cc2.html\">told</a> Axios, “this was premeditated murder.” Morale inside the West Wing has reportedly taken a substantial hit. “What a disgraceful breach of trust to leak schedules,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/madwest45/status/1092186986486657024\">tweeted</a> <strong>Madeleine Westerhout,</strong> the White House’s director of Oval Office operations. “What these don’t show are the hundreds of calls and meetings @realDonaldTrump takes everyday.”</p>\n<p>If Trump really is taking “hundreds” of undocumented calls and meetings every day, that’s another problem entirely, at least for those who care about transparency. But it’s hard to believe Westerhout’s denial, especially when the evidence of how Trump spends his time is so obvious online. From shortly after he wakes up until mid-morning, the president’s Twitter feed is often just responses to what he is watching on Fox News. Often, there is a consistent delay between what had just aired on <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> and a Trump tweet, suggesting that the president watches his programs on a DVR. In the evening, he returns to live-tweeting his favorite Fox hosts, or raging against an unflattering story on CNN.</p>\n<p>In stark contrast, Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-schedule-obama-bush-clinton-513c73ff-4d15-4e7a-9676-334557a894ee.html\">predecessors’ schedules</a> were fully booked. <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> was known to work <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/21/hillary-clinton-white-house_n_5360575.html\">constantly and at all hours</a>, sometimes calling aides in the middle of the night. <strong>George W. Bush</strong> began his day at 5:15 A.M., and <strong>Barack Obama</strong> would stay up until 2 A.M. reading. Trump seems to believe that nobody has ever worked harder&#8212;“[Obama] just sat in here and watched basketball all day,” Sims recalls Trump saying in the Oval Office&#8212;but his protestations appear to be little more than projection.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear whether Trump’s leaked post-midterm schedules reflect an increase or decrease in “Executive Time” over the past year, but it’s clearly information the White House didn’t want made public. The image of the 72-year-old president doddering around the White House with nothing to do for 60 percent of the time is hardly the image his campaign wants seen by the public before the next election. But this particular leak is unnerving for other reasons, too. It suggests, once again, that Trump’s inner circle is not loyal to him. It also would seem to confirm many of the other unflattering portraits of the president as incurious, disorganized, and distractible. ”Trump does review briefing materials, at least if you make it a point to have him do so,” one former senior White House official <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-white-house-meeting-preparation-eee8f937-a45d-499d-b322-acde6b50268c.html\">told Axios</a>. “But only if you talk and guide him through it as he’s reading.”</p>","rubric":"Executive Time","socialTitle":"A Huge Leak Confirms the Worst-Kept Secret of Trump’s

Giuliani,</strong> the relationship is not without its difficulties. “Rudy hates the job,” a Republican briefed on Giuliani’s thinking <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/rudy-hates-the-job-trumps-multi-front-war-is-taking-its-toll\">told</a> my colleague <strong>Gabriel Sherman</strong> last month. “Trump is very hard to deal with.” Trump, in turn, has occasionally exploded at his personal attorney for his <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/rudy-giuliani-robert-mueller-collusion-russia\">bewildering, confessional television appearances</a>. “Trump is screaming. He’s so mad at Rudy,” a source close to the president <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/giulianis-fate-is-uncertain-after-interviews\">said</a> after Giuliani participated in a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/even-if-he-did-do-it-it-wouldnt-be-a-crime-rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-robert-mueller-moscow-buzzfeed\">rambling Q&amp;A</a> with <em>The New Yorker.</em> Several people close to Trump have suggested that he fire Giuliani before he does any more damage.</p>\n<p>These tensions have largely played out behind the scenes, in the West Wing. But on Thursday, the president addressed the latest controversy surrounding Giuliani directly. “Rudy has been wrong,” Trump claimed in his first sit-down <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/us/politics/trump-interview-transcripts.html\">interview</a> with <em>The New York Times</em> in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/us/politics/trump-interview-excerpts.html\">over a year</a>, contradicting his attorney’s shifting statements regarding efforts by the Trump Organization to build a luxury high-rise in Moscow during the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>While Giuliani has since walked back his comments about the Moscow development, his original conjecture&#8212;that Trump was involved in conversations about the real-estate project up until November 2016&#8212;created a massive political headache for the White House. In late January, Giuliani <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/us/politics/trump-tower-moscow-cohen-giuliani.html\">told the <em>Times</em></a> that the talks were “going on from the day [he] announced to the day [he] won,” then immediately told <em>Meet the Press</em> that it was an <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-january-20-2019-n960731\">“active proposal”</a> through the very end of the election.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Trump attempted to repair the damage by tossing his attorney under the bus. “So let me tell you about about Trump Tower Moscow,” he told <em>Times</em> reporters <strong>Maggie Haberman</strong> and <strong>Peter Baker,</strong> who were accompanied in the Oval Office by the paper’s publisher, <strong>A. G. Sulzberger.</strong> “This was a very unimportant deal. This was a very unimportant deal. No. 1. No. 2, this was a deal, the only thing you heard is through Rudy [Giuliani]. Is that what you heard? Through Rudy?”</p>\n<p>“More recently we heard through Rudy, he quotes you,” said Baker.</p>\n<p>Trump responded by making it exceedingly clear that Giuliani did not know what he was talking about:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rudy was incorrect. No. 1, he was incorrect, and we’ve explained that, he was wrong. Rudy has been wrong. A little bit. But what has happened is this. I didn’t care. That deal was not important. It was essentially a letter of intent or an option. I’m not even sure that they had a site. And if you look at where that was sent to, that was a Michael Cohen thing. If you look, I always say, Why don’t you bring this up, to Jay Sekulow, good guy. I think it was sent to almost like a public address for Moscow. If you take a look at it. Take a good solid look. The original letter or something was sent. They didn’t even have anybody to send it to. But that deal is just like other deals. I was doing other deals. I was running for president, but I was also running a business.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even that admission is problematic, of course. Throughout the 2016 election, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-russia-hillary-clinton-emails-dnc-hack\">claimed</a> that he had “nothing to do with Russia,” despite his senior campaign staff meeting with a Russian lawyer peddling dirt on <strong>Hillary Clinton,</strong> and a longtime adviser making nice with WikiLeaks. As the <em>Times</em> recently reported, there were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/26/us/politics/trump-contacts-russians-wikileaks.html\">more than 100 contacts</a> between Trump, his associates, and Russians before the inauguration. In a string of indictments, special counsel <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> has described a vast web of interactions between people in Trump’s orbit and Russians seeking to influence the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Given all that has come to light, the president’s narrative has shifted. Sure, his real-estate company had business with Russia during the campaign, he has said, but it was only speculative. (BuzzFeed has <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation\">reported</a> that the Trump Tower Moscow project would have netted the Trump Organization some $300 million in profit&#8212;among the most lucrative deals he might ever have made.) Where’s the crime?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TIMES: Clearly there was a hope of having money. That was the reason you were pursuing it, right?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TRUMP: My point is this&#8212;It was a free option to look at a deal, to look at deals. That was not like, “I’m going to buy a property in Moscow. I’m going to do&#8212;or I’m building a building in Moscow.” Now, I would have had every right to do a deal. That’s what I did. That’s what I did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rudy was wrong in that he went&#8212;I think what Rudy was looking at, I think, was that in the statement I made to the Mueller group, we talked about during that period of a year, up until the election, we talked about that. So he may have been referring to that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

Trump responded with another malicious tweet.","body":"<p>Just hours after <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> opted to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/inside-michael-cohens-decision-to-postpone-his-big-day-on-capitol-hill\">postpone</a> his testimony before the House Oversight Committee, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> was ready with a comeback, telling <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/01/23/trump-cohen-threatened-by-the-truth-sot-vpx.cnn\">reporters</a> of Cohen, “I would say he’s been threatened by the truth.” On Thursday morning, he followed up with a tweet drawing a parallel between Cohen and <strong>Hillary Clinton,</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1088418271194464256\">writing</a>, “So interesting that bad lawyer Michael Cohen, who sadly will not be testifying before Congress, is using the lawyer of Crooked Hillary Clinton to represent him - Gee, how did that happen? Remember July 4th weekend when Crooked went before FBI &amp; wasn’t sworn in, no tape, nothing?” (Never mind that Trump has his own <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/emmet-flood-named-white-house-counsel-on-a-temporary-basis/2018/10/18/79b346aa-d2f2-11e8-83d6-291fcead2ab1_story.html\">Clinton lawyer</a> serving as his acting White House counsel.)</p>\n<p>Ironically, it was Trump’s threats, along with those of his lawyer, <strong>Rudy Giuliani,</strong> that Cohen cited in his decision to back out of testifying in the first place. As my colleague <strong>Emily Jane Fox</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/inside-michael-cohens-decision-to-postpone-his-big-day-on-capitol-hill\">reported</a> on Wednesday, Cohen said he was concerned for his own safety and the well-being of his family after several tweets by the president (last year, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1069613383622803456\">tweeted</a> that Cohen ought to serve a “full and complete sentence” for “all of the TERRIBLE, unrelated to Trump, things” he had done), not to mention Trump’s phone call into Fox News wherein he cast aspersions on Cohen’s father-in-law. Giuliani continued the drum beat over the weekend, <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1901/20/sotu.01.html\">suggesting</a> on CNN’s <em>State of the Union</em> that Cohen was cooperating with law enforcement to protect his father-in-law, who he alleged had ties to organized crime in Ukraine. “He goes and testifies against some people that are possibly in organized crime, they ain’t going to be applauding for him when he goes into a restaurant in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, believe me,” Giuliani said.</p>\n<p>Reps. <strong>Elijah Cummings</strong> and <strong>Adam Schiff,</strong> who chair the House Oversight and Intelligence committees, respectively, released a joint statement saying they “understand” Cohen’s position, and have offered to work with him to ensure security meets his standards, but added that, for Cohen, “not appearing before Congress was never an option.” The Senate Intelligence Committee also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2019/01/24/ex-trump-fixer-michael-cohen-subpoenaed-by-senate-committee-lawyer-says-a-day-after-cohen-sought-to-back-out-of-house-testimony/?utm_term=.fcbe9fbdf501&amp;wpisrc=al_news__alert-politics--alert-national&amp;wpmk=1\">has subpoenaed</a> Cohen, according to his lawyer, <strong>Lanny Davis.</strong> When he does testify, Democrats will have plenty to ask him about. Since he was sentenced to prison in December for tax fraud and lying to investigators, reports have emerged that Cohen not only discussed plans for a Trump Tower Moscow during the height of the presidential campaign in 2016, but paid someone to rig online polls for Trump in 2015, and was reportedly directed to lie to Congress by Trump himself. (The last allegation, reported by BuzzFeed News, was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/buzzfeed-mueller-saga-veteran-journalists-circumspect-confused\">thrown into question</a> after <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> issued a carefully worded denial of some elements of the story.)</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Cohen’s team is keeping pressure on the president. “Let me be very clear: the House of Representatives now has an obligation&#8212;a resolution of censure, when the president of the United States indisputably intimidates and obstructs justice to prevent a witness from testifying, is in order,” Davis <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/24/trump-michael-cohen-testimony-1121852\">argued</a> on <em>Good Morning America</em> on Thursday. “So is a federal criminal investigation of Rudy Giuliani for witness tampering. Calling out a man’s father-in-law and wife in order to intimidate the witness is not fair game.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The family drama surrounding <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/biden-2020-front-runner-family-divorce-drama?inline\">Joe Biden’s presidential bid</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; What to make of the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/buzzfeed-mueller-saga-veteran-journalists-circumspect-confused?inline\">BuzzFeed-Mueller mystery</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; A happy ending for one <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/fyre-festival-caterer-gofundme-maryann-rolle?inline\">Fyre Festival contractor</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Intrigue in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jesse-angelo-abruptly-exits-the-new-york-post-murdoch?inline\">Murdoch-land</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Yes, <em>Schitt’s Creek</em> really is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/yes-schitts-creek-really-is-that-good?inline\">that good</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Mueller Investigation","socialTitle":"Trump Mocks Cohen After He Says He Fears for His Safety","socialDescription":"The president’s former lawyer postponed a congressional appearance after the president threatened his father-in-law.

At the time, just a year before 9/11, pop music might have been at its creative nadir, the Billboard charts painted with a tableau of barely-remembered artists who couldn’t be bothered by political commentary: <strong>Sisqó,</strong> Creed, <strong>Rob Thomas</strong> and <strong>Santana,</strong> Savage Garden, and various musicians who wore carpenter jeans and frosted tips. Rage wasn’t playing that game. The nation was slouching toward a showdown between <strong>George W. Bush</strong> and <strong>Al Gore,</strong> two white men in suits racing to the mushy middle.</p>\n<p>With <strong>Michael Moore</strong> directing, Rage used their video to hammer Bush and Gore as two sides of the same centrist coin, a pair of incrementalist politicians beholden to a corrupt system that favored Wall Street billionaires and entrenched-power elites. Given the history that would unfold in the coming years across the Levant, it was a facile argument in hindsight. But politics at that time, before the World Trade Center fell, was defined by complacency and disinterest. Rage declared their answer to this broken system at the conclusion of their music video for “Testify”: an endorsement of <strong>Ralph Nader,</strong> the consumer-rights advocate and Green Party nominee who proclaimed that, “If you’re not turned onto politics, politics will turn on you.” Other celebrities at the time, like <strong>Susan Sarandon, Eddie Vedder,</strong> and <strong>Ben Harper,</strong> lined up behind Nader. He would go on to win 2.8 million votes, only a slice of the national count. But Nader had enough cultural buzz and disaffected supporters on the left to capture almost 100,000 votes in Florida, tipping the presidency in Bush’s direction with an assist from <strong>Pat Buchanan.</strong></p>\n<p>Almost 20 years later, another third-party spoiler has entered the presidential fray. His name is <strong>Howard Schultz,</strong> the self-made billionaire founder of Starbucks. No one, however, will be making a music video about Howard Schultz. Politicians only seep into pop culture when they inspire people, and Schultz, with his hand-gesturing boardroom speak and glaring lack of agenda, is so far only inspiring rage tweets from Democrats who don’t want him to help <strong>Donald Trump</strong> get re-elected. That isn’t stopping Schultz from moving forward. In a Medium <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Howardschultz/ourpath-9164e18bdb98\">post</a> published Tuesday, Schultz wrote that he feels “a deep responsibility and moral obligation to address Americans’ frustrations with our broken two-party system.” Despite the criticisms, he wrote, “I’m excited to keep the conversation going,” the ultimate piece of charmless corporate jargon.</p>\n<p>But Tuesday brought another piece of news that reminds us why Schultz faces such long odds if he chooses to run: the entrance of <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> into the Democratic presidential race. As Sanders and Trump demonstrated in 2016, insurgent politics today is practiced inside the contours of the two-party system, not outside of it. In an era of extreme partisanship, all of the action in American politics, the darkness and the fun alike, is taking place inside the tents of the two major parties. Whether Sanders can fully realize his presidential ambitions the second time around is an open question. But Sanders knows that as much as people loathe the two political parties, those parties also remain the two most important vehicles in the war for power and ideas in 2020. It’s an essential truth about our moment that could leave Schultz out in the cold, hoping to pay off the bouncer to get in to the party.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Given their behavior and tactics to date, Sanders and Schultz, two boys from Brooklyn, are gambling with two very different theories about politics. Both theories have their limits, but Sanders seems to have a better understanding of the state of play as the curtain rises on the 2020 presidential race. Schultz, if he runs, appears to be campaigning from the inside out, a fully-realized American power elite portraying himself as a truth-telling outsider. His media strategy from the get-go seemed the very definition of Amtrak-corridor conventional: a book tour, a <em>60 Minutes</em> interview, sit-downs with <em>Morning Joe</em> and the <em>Goop</em> podcast. None of it screamed populist. As he stepped out into the public crossfire, Schultz wasn’t talking about his rags-to-riches story or his admirable efforts to bring health care to thousands of low-wage earners. Instead, he was lashing both parties for abandoning the centrist impulses of the “silent majority”&#8212;a plurality, if anything&#8212;that was predictably silent when the Twitter mobs immediately came for his head.</p>\n<p>Schultz has a right to tell his story and deserves not to be dismissed out of hand simply because he is a billionaire. The angry question of “What have you ever done?” thrown at Schultz by the online hordes can be equally applied to any number of backbencher politicians and professional activists who are here for the re-tweets. But Schultz misfired by broaching the idea of a third-party candidacy at a time when the public is questioning the very idea of whether billionaires should exist. Those criticisms might have been blunted had he brought a big idea or two to the table. <strong>Ross Perot</strong> and Nader both had proactive agendas and passionate pet issues that defined their candidacies, which didn’t rest solely on trashing their opponents. As a consequence, both Perot and Nader managed to have an outsized impact with voters despite the electoral futility of their campaigns. Schultz, instead, has been little more than a scold, chiding the very politicians who are bringing actual ideas to the table.</p>\n<p>Schultz’s other big mistake was suggesting a third-party bid, claiming a hunger in the country for something other than the menu offerings from Democrats and Republicans. It is true that roughly a third of the country identifies as moderate, according to a recent Pew survey, suggesting a lane for Schultz (or his political consultants). But what Schultz seems not to understand is that in an era of partisan sorting, moderates, too, are choosing sides. For the most part, they are drifting into the Democratic Party, which recaptured the House of Representatives last November not because of firebrand liberals like <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,</strong> but on the backs of suburban moderates hailing from places like Orange County and central Virginia. Moderates do have power. At the moment, they’re just choosing to vote Democrat in opposition to President Trump. What’s more, the idea that registered partisans might abandon their party in the ballot box in favorite of a sensible moderate is increasingly quaint. As the political scientist <strong>Lee Drutman</strong> has written, partisan identity in the age of Trump is much more closely aligned with social and cultural identity. That lends a more intense meaning to your partisan jersey, red team or blue. Common ground is much more difficult to locate outside of the two parties. If Schultz wanted an honest hearing at a time of deep partisan divide, the Democratic primary would have been the most logical place for it. Followed, of course, by a CNN town hall.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>While Schultz runs from the inside out, Sanders seems to be reprising the strategy that almost got him to the pinnacle in 2016, running from the outside in, a people-powered ideologue gunning to take over a Democratic Party that still regards him with suspicion. The very fact that Sanders was not fully accepted into the ranks of the Democratic establishment is one source of his appeal.</p>\n<p>Sanders might be 77 years old and “salty as ever,” as CNN’s <strong>Kate Bolduan</strong> said on-air Tuesday after his announcement, but he’s still a central figure in the dialectic of the Democratic Party, its most uncompromising ideological figure, and best fund-raiser. Like Trump, Sanders didn’t get there by climbing the ladder in Washington like his fellow senators now in the presidential race; he did it by tapping into common-sense ideas about economic fairness and raising oceans of small-donor cash online in the process. He delivered his message using non-traditional media and waited for the green-room journalism crowd to catch up. A democratic socialist, Sanders might have chosen to run in 2016 as a third-party liberal in the mold of Nader. But instead, he smartly decided to disrupt the Democratic Party from the inside by seeking its presidential nomination, all while never calling himself a Democrat. Sanders became the liberal folk hero of the last campaign, the subject of graffiti murals, hipster endorsements, and D.I.Y. merch, the cool grassroots signifiers that swirled around Nader a decade and a half earlier.</p>\n<p>While Sanders lost to <strong>Hillary Clinton,</strong> his failed campaign nevertheless established his place in the political firmament. Today, as he embarks on a new race, his signature issues are now key touchstones in the Democratic primary. When his rivals tip-toe around their commitment to Medicare for all, a new minimum wage, and free college education, Sanders will be right there holding their feet to the fire. And as curmudgeonly as Sanders seems, he also likes the attention from a mainstream press that ignored him for so many decades, which is why he could barely conceal his smiles during his announcement interview with <strong>John Dickerson</strong> on <em>CBS This Morning.</em> Sanders can’t wait to go back on <em>Ellen</em> and hang out with <strong>Killer Mike.</strong> He is able to do all of these things precisely because he isn’t a creature of the Democratic establishment&#8212;because he is disruptive and refuses to play by the rules. So why not run it back in 2020?</p>\n<p>Sanders’s biggest failure in 2016 was not building coalitions. He found it difficult to expand his reach beyond liberals, white workers, and young people, to win over the older women and African-Americans who eventually gave their votes to Clinton. But on CBS, Sanders told Dickerson that unlike in 2016, he can plausibly win the nomination without cobbling together a majority of Democrats. “In some ways it makes it easier,” Sanders said. “When you’re running against one person you know you gotta have 51 percent of the votes. Now who knows what you need? Thirty, thirty-five percent?”</p>\n<p>That may come to pass: Trump slowly grew his campaign throughout the Republican primaries when many pundits expected him to top out around 25 percent. But just as Republicans don’t behave as Democrats, Democrats don’t behave as Republicans. The impulses and issue sets are different, and Sanders has yet to convince Democrats beyond his base of economic progressives that he cares deeply about the plight of immigrants, criminal-justice reform, and the white-hot cultural issues that are roiling our politics under Trump. It would be glib, though, to suggest Sanders hasn’t learned from his mistakes. He has a chance to convince Democrats he’s evolved, even if Democrats now have many more choices than they did when it was just Bernie versus Hillary all day every day.</p>\n<p>Sanders’s outsider patina gave him power in 2016 and it will again in this campaign. But he can no longer wield the element of surprise. Sanders made plenty of enemies in the Democratic Party, in and around Clinton’s campaign specifically. There are legions of well-connected Democrats who do not like Sanders and would rather he spend the rest of his days slurping down Ben &amp; Jerry’s in Burlington. They will plant negative stories about him, steer money to other candidates, puff up his rivals, and happily let him twist in the wind when he stumbles. Those things might not matter to his die-hard supporters, but every successful Democratic nominee after <strong>Jimmy Carter</strong> played nice with party insiders in pursuit of the ring. Even <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> has met with <strong>Jamie Dimon.</strong></p>\n<p>Sanders seems like he’d rather watch a 10-hour <em>Bachelor</em> marathon, <em>Clockwork Orange</em>&#8211;style, than do the same. He is permanently averse to playing the inside political game, gabbing with power brokers on the phone, or charming the media off-the-record. His sequel campaign will test whether those choices matter anymore, whether big speeches, lofty policy ideas, and social media alone can carry the day. This might be a Very <strong>Bill Simmons</strong> Hot Take, but Sanders is the <strong>James Harden</strong> of politics. He’ll get you 30 points a night, but it’s hard to see how he wins a championship without getting his teammates involved. Either way, he’ll still be in the conversation.</p>\n<p><em>Peter Hamby is the host of Snapchat’s</em> Good Luck America.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"2020","socialTitle":"The Bernie Conundrum: Can “Salty as Ever” Sanders Be a Real 2020 Player?","socialDescription":"Whether Sanders can fully realize his presidential ambitions the second time around is an open question.

but one of <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> most shocking claims about a southern border wall has proven a bit exaggerated. The president claimed in Friday’s bizarre Rose Garden presser that several of his predecessors “have told me that we should have” built a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, though he declined to name which former presidents supported it. Perhaps unsurprisingly, representatives for the Bush family and <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> have denied the allegation.</p>\n<p>“This should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me, and they all know it,” Trump said. “Some of them have told me that we should have done it.”</p>\n<p>Clinton spokesperson <strong>Angel Ureña</strong> explicitly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/04/trump-former-presidents-border-wall-1082562\">refuted</a> the president’s assertion, adding that the two men have “not talked since the inauguration.” Bush representative <strong>Freddy Ford</strong> said the wall has never been discussed between the two. Former president George H.W. Bush <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/george-hw-bush-dead-at-94\">died in November</a>, though it is seen as unlikely that he and Trump had any significant discussion of a wall. Trump has famously kept his distance from the Bush family in the wake of past comments and a 2016 presidential campaign rivalry with <strong>Jeb Bush.</strong> Trump did not attend the funeral of former First Lady Barbara Bush in April.</p>\n<p>That just leaves former presidents <strong>Barack Obama</strong> and <strong>Jimmy Carter,</strong> both of whom have criticized Trump’s positions on immigration. An Obama spokesperson reportedly declined comment, though Obama himself has come out against the wall on numerous occasions. Carter, like Obama, has pushed for technological advancements to strengthen U.S. border security, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/trump-wall-shutdown.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, but not the kind of wall that Trump is seeking $5 billion to build. A senior administration official reportedly suggested that Trump was “referring to public comments his predecessors have made about the need for border security, not necessarily for a wall specifically.”</p>","rubric":"Wall Tales","socialTitle":"Former Presidents Deny Supporting Border Wall, Despite Trump Claims","socialDescription":"Neither Bush nor Clinton ever shared Trump’s desire

hours into Ted Cruz’s 21-hour “filibuster” to block President Barack Obama’s health-care law in 2013, the then freshman, Republican senator from Texas pulled out a copy of Dr. Seuss’s <em>Green Eggs and Ham.</em> You see, it was just past eight o’clock, nearing his daughter’s bedtime, and, well, it was one of her favorite stories. So, he started reading, rhyming couplet by rhyming couplet, to a near-empty Senate floor and anyone tuning in to great horror on C-SPAN 2. He talked and talked and talked some more, rebuking politicians for their “bad haircuts” and “cheap suits,” professing his love for White Castle, comparing his stand against Obamacare to the efforts resisting the Nazis or the start of the American Revolution. Only, this stalling tactic wasn’t actually a filibuster, because the Senate had already scheduled a vote later that day without any possibility of delay. The heroic “filibuster” narrative Cruz was writing about himself was really just a 21-hour speech to no one.\n<p>It is easy to see why Cruz was not the most popular man in Washington. His colleagues in the Senate referred to him as a “schoolyard bully” and a rabble-rouser, not only because of his Dr. Seuss mishap but also for his strident championing of the government shutdown that same year and his ability to somehow always end up as the guy fanning the fire. But where his Washington compatriots tired of his demagogy, the burgeoning class of Tea Party conservatives and evangelical voters ate it up. He was an outsider ready, willing, and stubborn enough to call Washington’s bluff and hold his ground.</p>\n<p>A Princeton- and Harvard-educated man with slicked-back hair married to a Goldman Sachs managing director may not seem like the most obvious surrogate for an anti-Establishment wing of a party, which is why Cruz is quick to sell the story of a Cuban immigrant father who struggled with alcoholism and eventually found his faith (at his son’s urging). He talks openly about taking two jobs to pay for school and just recently paying off the $100,000 in student loans he used to finance his education.</p>\n<p>Cruz rode the Tea Party wave into the 2016 G.O.P. presidential race, where he was the first candidate to officially announce his intention to run for president. He managed to outlast most of the Republican establishment candidates, who fell by the Donald Trump wayside, clinging onto the hope of a delegate fight and a contested Republican convention in Cleveland.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/26/57475cec8c923dbe03a2b539_hive-contributor-profile-ted-cruz.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 26, 2016 4:32 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-ted-cruz.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-ted-cruz.jpg","credit":"By Randy Holmes/ABC/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"57475cebb09823be03ef3d98","createdAt":"May 26, 2016 4:30 pm","revision":3,"modifiedAt":"May 26, 2016 4:32 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 518294916","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/ted-cruz","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/26/57475cec8c923dbe03a2b539_hive-contributor-profile-ted-cruz.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 26, 2016 4:32 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-ted-cruz.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-ted-cruz.jpg","credit":"By Randy Holmes/ABC/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"57475cebb09823be03ef3d98","createdAt":"May 26, 2016 4:30 pm","revision":3,"modifiedAt":"May 26, 2016 4:32 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 518294916","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"573629ad84cb4922586cd115","revision":3,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/ted-cruz"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Zac Efron Is a Scary-Good Ted Bundy in <em>Extremely Wicked</em> Trailer","promoHed":"Zac Efron Is a Scary-Good Ted Bundy in <em>Extremely Wicked</em> Trailer","dek":"<em>Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile</em> also features Lily Collins, Jim Parsons, and John Malkovich.","promoDek":"<em>Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile</em> also features Lily Collins, Jim Parsons, and John Malkovich.","body":"<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-lW6Z38HHJw\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-lW6Z38HHJw\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong>Zac Efron</strong> is ready to creep you out. In the first trailer for <em>Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile,</em> the actor dives into the meaty role of Ted Bundy, the serial killer who murdered dozens of women and was later executed at Florida State Prison in 1989. The film isn’t necessarily a biopic, though; rather, it’s an examination of Bundy through the eyes of <strong>Liz Kloepfer</strong> (<strong>Lily Collins</strong>), the woman who <a href=\"https://www.biography.com/news/ted-bundy-elizabeth-kloepfer\">stood by him</a> as the truth about his murderous ways gradually became public.</p>\n<p>Bundy, however, is still the star of the show in this trailer, with Efron hamming it up as the killer with a charming facade who managed to escape twice from jail. “I’m more popular than Disney World,” he declares at one point. Which is questionable! But it’s true that Bundy, especially post-escapes, was a source of spectacle, with hordes of people showing up to watch his trials unfold. The trailer focuses more on that element of it all, just barely hinting at the violence that Bundy committed over the course of his life.</p>\n<p>The cast is rounded out by <strong>Jim Parsons</strong> as Florida prosecutor Larry Simpson, a bewigged <strong>Kaya Scodelario</strong> as Bundy’s wife Carole Ann Boone, and <strong>John Malkovich</strong> as the no-nonsense Judge Edward D. Cowart, the man who ultimately imposed the death sentence on Bundy. “Take care of yourself,” Cowart famously said after the sentencing. “I don’t feel any animosity toward you. I want you to know that.”</p>\n<p><em>Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile</em> is set to debut at the Sundance Film Festival. A formal release date has not yet been set.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A red carpet <a

The streamer released <em>Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,</em> a four-episode docuseries about the convicted serial murderer, who was executed 30 years ago in Florida. However, as was the case when Bundy was alive, several observers are focusing more on the killer’s (alleged!) attractiveness than his crimes (which, reminder, involved Bundy brutally murdering dozens of women). The inappropriate public thirst for Bundy has gotten to the point where Netflix thought it pertinent to issue a reminder that there are plenty of <em>other</em> hot people to lust over on its platform.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1089950741064601600\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1089950741064601600\">https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1089950741064601600</a></p></blockquote></div><p>“I’ve seen a lot of talk about Ted Bundy’s alleged hotness and would like to gently remind everyone that there are literally THOUSANDS of hot men on the service &#8212; almost all of whom are not convicted serial murderers,” the platform tweeted on Monday.</p>\n<p>The streamer had a similar issue when the series <em>You</em> became available on its platform. The thriller, which originally aired on Lifetime, stars <strong>Penn Badgley</strong> as a murderous, obsessive boyfriend who does creepy and violent things to keep his girlfriend close. But of course, despite the character’s murderous ways, Badgley himself has noticed that viewers are fawning over his character for all the wrong reasons.</p>\n<p>“In a more just society, we would all see Joe as problematic and not be interested in the show, but that’s not the society we live in,” he said in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/arts/television/penn-badgley-you-netflix.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, adding that the character’s attractiveness and the way he presents himself are part and parcel with his dangerous charm. “Joe is not that far from some of the characters we love to see as art and dissect ad nauseam, who we’ve found in Jack Kerouac or J.D. Salinger’s work. But this was before we were having the kind of more nuanced conversations around race and gender that we are now. If anyone other than a young white man were to behave like these characters behave, nobody’s having it.”</p>\n<p>The Bundy obsession is similarly disturbing. Aside from the Netflix doc, directed by <strong>Joe Berlinger,</strong> there’s also an upcoming movie about the killer (directed, once again, by Berlinger), starring <strong>Zac Efron</strong> as Bundy. The film, <em>Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile,</em> made its debut at the Sundance Film Festival, earning strong reviews for Efron’s portrayals, but existentially fraught reviews about, well, every other element. “<em>Extremely Wicked</em> isn’t a hagiography, exactly,” <em>Vanity Fair</em> critic <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/zac-efron-ted-bundy-movie-review-extremely-wicked-shockingly-evil-and-vile\"><strong>Richard Lawson</strong> writes</a>, “but it puts Bundy so palpably at the center of the film that we can’t help but become invested in his flights from justice. He’s the hero, and Berlinger fails to properly contextualize the grim loyalty Bundy stokes.”</p>\n<p>Questions have also arisen about how the Bundy obsession is being taken by the people whose lives were destroyed by his crimes. <strong>Kathy Kleiner Rubin,</strong> who survived an attack by Bundy in 1978, recently <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2019/01/29/ted-bundy-kathy-kleiner-rubin-zac-efron-extremely-wicked-shockingly-evil-vile/\">told TMZ</a> that she was conditionally in favor of the film, at least: “I don’t have a problem with people looking at it as long as they understand that what they’re watching wasn’t a normal person,” she said. “When they do say positive and wonderful things about him . . . that’s who Bundy wanted you to see.” <em>Extremely Wicked</em> does glorify the murderer, she said&#8212;but she ultimately thinks it’s useful for people to see the type of behavior Bundy exhibited in order to charm and lure people to their deaths.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A red carpet <a

performance.","body":"<p>It’s always interesting when <strong>Zac Efron</strong> goes dark. Well, in the movies, anyway. He was introduced to us in such airy, wholesome fashion&#8212;singing, dancing, and twinkly-eyed mooning in Disney’s cultural watershed <em>High School Musical</em>&#8212;that it’s still startling, 13 years later, to see that glow hardened into a glint. He did it most effectively in <em>Neighbors,</em> turning his chiseled features and ropey frame into agents of pained menace. And now he’s gone real dark to play serial killer Ted Bundy in the new film <em>Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile,</em> which premiered here at the Sundance Film Festival on Saturday.</p>\n<p>It’s indeed a wicked bit of casting. In addition to his heinous crimes, Bundy was famed for being disarmingly good-looking and charming. But he certainly wasn’t an Efron-level sun-god&#8212;so Efron’s presence in the movie lends the proceedings an extra otherworldliness, heightening the insidious appeal of American serial-killer lore to something almost pornographic. User experience may vary depending on how innately Efron’s magnetism works on you, but I was sickeningly drawn in.</p>\n<p>Which is a triumph of sorts for Efron, proving he can do <em>Greatest Showman</em> razzle-dazzle and shifty sociopathy with equal persuasiveness. But it’s also a bit of a problem, a further indictment of our serial killer-sick culture that the film, directed by documentarian <strong>Joe Berlinger,</strong> doesn’t reckon with enough. <em>Extremely Wicked</em> isn’t a hagiography, exactly, but it puts Bundy so palpably at the center of the film that we can’t help but become invested in his flights from justice. He’s the hero, and Berlinger fails to properly contextualize the grim loyalty Bundy stokes.</p>\n<p>The film tries, mostly by spending a fair amount of time with <strong>Liz Kendall</strong> (<strong>Lily Collins</strong>), who was Bundy’s girlfriend when law enforcement was finally closing in. We watch as Kendall stands by her man despite a mounting unease, a growing conviction&#8212;or rather, resignation&#8212;that Bundy has never been who he said he was. That’s a potentially fascinating, depressing character arc to explore, love curdling in such an extreme way. And Collins&#8212;so forcefully good two Sundances ago in <em>To the Bone</em>&#8212;is up to the task. But Berlinger gives her the same scene over and over again: Kendall drinking and smoking in her house while ignoring phone calls from an incarcerated Bundy. Only in a final confrontation scene does Kendall’s side of things get its fair due.</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5c4f1f312795516e91000007.js?muted=1\"></div></div><p>To the film’s credit, when we’re with Bundy, we’re at least not seeing him rape, murder, and mutilate women. We’re almost entirely spared any of that. <em>Extremely Wicked</em> instead focuses on Bundy’s legal trials and prison escapes, his slipperiness and unnervingly unwavering insistence on his innocence. Throughout, Efron maintains a riveting intensity, smartly infusing Bundy’s solicitous appeal with a creeping creepiness. Like someone who can wiggle their ears (or their pecs), Efron has an uncanny command of his natural charisma&#8212;he can change its frequency in subtle but richly communicative ways. His is a controlled, thoughtful performance; a mature one, too. It does the work of so many Sundance star turns, reframing an actor’s profile at perhaps a crux point in their career.</p>\n<p>But again, I’m not sure what all that thoughtfulness really gives us as an audience. And as a culture! I’m probably as guilty as anyone for not only participating in the current true-crime boom, but also for giddily ingesting serial-killer fiction ever since I first saw <em>The Silence of the Lambs.</em> (A story inspired, partly, by Bundy.) And yet something in the current discourse about what kind of stories we want to tell, and how we want to tell them, has dislodged the thing in me that kept me gripped by these kinds of narratives; I have trouble finding the justification for the prurience anymore. <em>Extremely Wicked</em> only furthers that distaste, even as it tries to give us a new, more humane angle on all this horror.</p>\n<p>Maybe that’s my failing&#8212;or bias&#8212;but I left <em>Extremely Wicked</em> wondering what the point of it all was. Why Efron chose to show us this side of his ability in this way. Why Berlinger&#8212;who also has a documentary series about Bundy that just dropped on Netflix&#8212;is so compelled by this story, which is almost plain in its squalid, senseless tragedy. At its worse, the movie feels almost sympathetic to Bundy. Its title is taken from a statement read by Judge Edward Cowart (<strong>John Malkovich</strong>) as he sentenced Bundy to death, a weary speech that also included a sort of rueful wish that Bundy could have employed his smarts and resourcefulness toward something good and productive, as if that’s the real loss, the real shame, here.</p>\n<p>At the end of the film, Berlinger lists the names of all of Bundy’s known victims, in perhaps an attempt to retrain our focus on the people who really matter in this story. But these women are such faceless nonentities in the rest of the film that this brief, somber acknowledgment seems almost cruel in its offhandedness. If all we’re really taking from a movie about a man who murdered 30-plus women is “Zac Efron sure is surprising,” then I don’t think that movie has earned its existence.

I wasn’t in charge of it,” Sarandos said during the conference. “But in general there was a disparity. What it did for us was it had us go back and look at all of our productions&#8212;and all of our productions that were being run by third parties&#8212;and make sure that none of those disparities existed.” Sarandos also mentioned adjusting the salary of an unnamed female executive, given her male counterparts had quoted higher histories for the same position.</p>\n<p>The Netflix content head nonetheless deferred to hiring “senior executives who you trust, who look like the world” to keep the company’s representations of diversity on track, rather than committing to any one initiative. “It’s in practice, it isn’t a plaque we hang on the wall,” Sarandos said of lessons learned from the <em>Crown</em> scandal. “It’s something that we do every day. I think that the Claire-Matt issue, as complicated as it is, pointed to a bigger problem throughout the industry.”</p>","rubric":"Streaming Salaries","socialTitle":"The Crown Gender-Pay Gap Made

End?","dek":"Fox has renewed the long-running comedy for two more seasons.","promoDek":"Fox has renewed the long-running comedy for two more seasons.","body":"<p>It’s a good thing the characters on <em>The Simpsons</em> are animated, because if Fox has its way, it appears they’ll need to remain ageless forever. Homer and his family already inhabit the longest-running prime-time scripted show in TV history, and now Fox has renewed the series for another two seasons&#8212;which will eventually bring the show’s episode total to 713.</p>\n<p>Fox revealed Wednesday that it has booked at least two more seasons of <em>The Simpsons,</em> currently airing its 30th season. On top of its 33 Emmy Awards, the show was also the first animated series to win a Peabody Award, paving the way for future animated series to take home the honor, including <em>South Park, The Boondocks,</em> and <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender.</em> And though many fans will tell you that the show’s glory days ended some time shortly after Season 8, Fox claims in its release that the series remains one of the top five comedies (in a tie) among adults 18 to 49.</p>\n<p>Fox also reports that this season’s “The Girl on the Bus,” an episode that aired last month, was the highest-rated episode of any scripted series to air this year on Fox among that coveted demographic. That seems like a solid indication that <em>The Simpsons</em> will stick around at Fox, not just because of its legacy, but also because it still delivers ratings results&#8212;better than many other series Fox has on its slate right now, at least.</p>\n<p>All of this is especially fascinating in light of the now-long-simmering controversy surrounding Apu, the show’s stereotypical Indian store clerk. Ever since <strong>Hari Kondabolu’s</strong> <em>The Problem with Apu</em> highlighted key problems with the character, <em>The Simpsons</em> has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/07/simpsons-apu-controversy-matt-groening-stereotypes-problem-with-apu\">struggled</a> to reconcile his portrayal with a world whose standards for representation have changed&#8212;and has even attracted criticism from <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/south-park-simpsons-problem-with-apu\">rival animated shows</a> in the process. But evidently, the controversy surrounding <em>The Simpsons</em> and Apu has not done much to dampen enthusiasm for the show&#8212;neither from Fox nor from the show’s still-healthy fan base.</p>\n<p>Then again, <em>The Simpsons</em> has overcome plenty of adversity in its three decades on the air&#8212;from longtime voice actor <strong>Harry Shearer’s</strong> back-and-forth over whether or not he would leave the series to <strong>Ted Cruz’s</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/02/ted-cruz-simpsons-republicans-democrats-party-of-lisa\">ongoing and embarrassing one-sided obsession</a> with making ham-fisted references to the show at every opportunity. If you can survive endlessly lame jokes from Ted Cruz, you can probably survive everything. So here’s to <em>The Simpsons</em>&#8212;a show that will probably outlive us all.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The <a

Will Beto forgo the presidency for another shot at Texas?","promoDek":"O’Rourke could plausibly beat John Cornyn in 2020. Will Beto forgo the presidency for another shot at Texas?","body":"<p>As <strong>Beto O’Rourke</strong> considers how much runway he can get out of his sudden political stardom, two paths stretch before him. The most obvious is a high-profile race for the presidency in 2020, which would pit the winsome ex-congressman against dozens of well-funded candidates. But since he lost his Senate bid to <strong>Ted Cruz</strong> in November by a scant few percentage points&#8212;a remarkable performance for a Democrat in Texas&#8212;party insiders have considered another option: why not have him run next year for Texas’s <em>other</em> Senate seat? After all, any Democratic president will need a Senate majority to implement their vision. “The party will need quality candidates who run ahead of the national political fundamentals,” liberal pundit <strong>Matthew Yglesias</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/6/18127187/beto-2020-president-senate-map\">argued</a> last year, shortly after Democrats took back the House but left the upper chamber solidly in Republican hands. “Responsible party leaders should be doing everything in their power to recruit quality politicians”&#8212;like, say, the guy who was almost successful in a state Democrats had written off.</p>\n<p>Senate Minority Leader <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> appears to be thinking along the same lines. Schumer, who is currently recruiting candidates to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/chuck-schumer-mitch-mcconnell-senate-2020\">oust his counterpart</a>, <strong>Mitch McConnell,</strong> reportedly met with O’Rourke last week to discuss him running against <strong>John Cornyn,</strong> the Senate majority whip. Cornyn is less well-known than Cruz, who was a serious contender for the presidency in 2016, and is also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/beto-orourke-should-run-for-senate-in-2020-he-could-win/2018/11/09/99263192-e462-11e8-ab2c-b31dcd53ca6b_story.html?utm_term=.321dd6b3310d\">less well-liked</a>. (Cruz, ever the spoiler, even got away with not endorsing Cornyn when he last ran for office.)</p>\n<p>O’Rourke would have other advantages, too, were he to decide against a presidential run and turn his eye back to Texas. He already has a massive fund-raising machine in place from his last run, high name recognition (which has only increased since he began flirting with a 2020 bid), and plenty of Democratic endorsements in the bank. Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/13/schumer-beto-castro-2020-senate-bid-1168554\">reports</a> that Representative <strong>Joaquin Castro,</strong> a Democrat from Texas who is also considering a run for Cornyn’s seat, would immediately step aside if O’Rourke wants it. “Joaquin believes Beto could beat John in 2020, and if Beto decides to see this thing through and do that, then Joaquin will give him his full support, just like he did against Ted Cruz,” a source close to Castro said. (Slightly complicating matters is the fact that Castro’s brother <strong>Julián,</strong> the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, has also announced a bid for the presidency, and Joaquin is his campaign chairman.)</p>\n<p>But the siren song of the presidency may be too strong for O’Rourke, whose profile went national during his campaign against Cruz. The G.O.P. reportedly fears he would be a tough competitor to beat. <strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/beto-orourke-2020\">begging him to run</a>. And he received exuberant feedback for the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/did-trump-just-turn-beto-into-a-2020-front-runner-el-paso-rally\">massive counter-rally</a> he held against <strong>Donald Trump</strong> this week in El Paso. Even out of office, and even off the official campaign trail, O’Rourke still drew a crowd comparable to Trump’s. Although O’Rourke has said he will not announce his decision until the end of the month, he is already sounding and acting like a candidate.</p>\n<p>And yet, as <strong>Peter Hamby</strong> recently <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/why-are-democrats-trying-to-annihilate-an-beto-campaign\">reported</a> for <em>Vanity Fair,</em> Beto’s centrist appeal could be a stumbling block in a Democratic primary that is being driven by the left. Progressives like the Texan, but some fear he could be a stalking horse for the same warmed-over Obama-Clinton politics that voters soured on in 2016. “They think the Establishment is always looking for someone to go against Bernie&#8212;to run against progressives in the party and stop them from being ascendant,” Georgetown University historian <strong>Michael Kazin</strong> told Hamby. “I think they are suspicious of Beto because he has taken oil and gas money, he’s becoming the darling of big donors, and Obama likes him.”</p>\n<p>Legally, Texas law <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/politics/technically-beto-orourke-can-run-president-senate-2020/\">allows</a> O’Rourke to run for both the Senate and the presidency at the same time, hedging his bets. But no matter which decision he makes, the Texas G.O.P. is watching him closely, realizing after his stunning performance in 2018 that they can <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/texas-2020-presidential-election\">no longer take the Lone Star State for granted</a>. “Texas is no longer, I believe, a reliably red state,” Cornyn <a href=\"http://www.hughhewitt.com/senator-john-cornyn-on-the-next-year-in-the-senate/\">told</a> radio host <strong>Hugh Hewitt</strong> recently. ”We are on the precipice of turning purple, and we’ve got a lot of work to do to keep it red, because we lost, we got blown out in the urban areas. We got beat in the suburbs, which used to be our traditional strongholds. And if it wasn’t for the rural areas of the state where Senator Cruz won handily, it might not have turned out the way it did.” Republicans’ best hope, as Cornyn put it, is that O’Rourke becomes a “national Democrat” and gets out of the state: “I think Beto’s got stars in his eyes, and he’s going to go for the big one.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"2020 Presidential Election","socialTitle":"Texas Forever?: Schumer Wants Beto to Reconsider the Senate","socialDescription":"O’Rourke could plausibly beat John Cornyn in 2020.

Might Be Just the Beginning","dek":"Texas Republicans are getting nervous about 2020: “The challenges we face in Texas are very real.”","promoDek":"Texas Republicans are getting nervous about 2020: “The challenges we face in Texas are very real.”","body":"<p>In December, <strong>Ted Cruz</strong> turned his narrow win against <strong>Beto O’Rourke</strong> into a punch line, <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2018/12/03/ted-cruz-quips-needed-beto-orourke-teach-humility-since-trumps-lesson-didnt-take\">joking</a> at a black-tie dinner that O’Rourke’s candidacy was “meant to teach me humility.” For Republican strategists in Texas, however, Democrats’ sudden resurgence in the state in 2018 midterms is no cause for mirth&#8212;and could be a red flag for <strong>Donald Trump</strong> in 2020. As Hive contributor <strong>David M. Drucker</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/texas-republicans-fear-trump-could-lose-the-state-in-2020\">reported</a> for the <em>Washington Examiner,</em> the Texas G.O.P. is looking at the numbers and beginning to sweat. “We are talking to everyone,” <strong>James Dickey,</strong> Texas’s party chairman, fretted. “The challenges we face in Texas are very real.”</p>\n<p>Republicans have long taken Texas’s 38 electoral college votes for granted, diverting national resources to swing states like Ohio or Florida. The state hasn’t gone blue since 1976, when <strong>Jimmy Carter</strong> was on the ballot. Now, however, several factors are working against the G.O.P. in Texas, and could be enough to push the state over the edge. One is demographic change, which is slowly making Texas more urban and more diverse. Another is the growth of Texas’s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/white-suburbia-the-source-of-trumps-texas-troubles\">white suburban population</a>, which tends to vote less Republican than the state’s shrinking rural population. Last November, O’Rourke won suburban women by 55 percent to 44 percent. (While Cruz won rural men by 59 percent to 41 percent, his support dropped by 10 points in the suburbs.) “Trump is still in White House, which means the dynamic is going to be very similar,” a veteran Republican operative told Drucker. “The white, upper-class suburban voters are not pro-Trump at all.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps most decisive is the extensive progressive grassroots infrastructure that sprung up in the state during the last midterm cycle, resulting in key Democratic wins in the state’s 32nd and 7th districts. The G.O.P.’s ground game in Texas is comparatively minimal, to the point that the state’s wealthy Republican donors often fund races elsewhere. (In 2013, for instance, fracking billionaires <strong>Farris</strong> and <strong>Dan Wilks</strong> dropped $10 million in Montana <a href=\"https://missoulian.com/news/local/billionaire-fracking-brothers-top-donors-to-montana-political-campaigns/article_f8c249ae-7395-11e2-b118-0019bb2963f4.html\">to influence the state legislature</a>, whereas they spent <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2018-elections/2018/02/22/fracking-billionaires-pump-millions-texas-races-pushing-state-gop-even-right\">millions</a> to defend their own turf in 2018.) “Because of what happened organically on the Democrat side, Republicans in Texas have a large organizational gap that exists,” Texas veteran operative <strong>Chris Homan</strong>  told Drucker. “In 2018, we simply did not have the kind of people and activists at the scale the Democrats enjoyed. This is a significant advantage the Democrats have going into this cycle.”</p>\n<p>Already, Democrats are poised to take advantage of this weakness. On Monday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/28/politics/dccc-2020-battlefield-map-memo-texas-suburbs/index.html\">unveiled</a> its list of target districts for 2020. Six of the target seats are in Texas&#8212;more than any other state on the list. They include the 10th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, and 31st districts, all of which are suburban areas outside of major cities (San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, and Austin).</p>\n<p>The unrest could spell trouble for the president, whose popularity has spooked Republicans: according to a <a href=\"https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/set/donald-trump-approval-october-2018\">University of Texas poll</a>, just 36 percent of Texans approved strongly of Trump, while 40 percent disapproved strongly. Even if Trump kept every state he won in 2016&#8212;a relatively unlikely scenario given recent numbers in states like <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/donald-trump-2020-wisconsin-polling\">Wisconsin</a>&#8212;he would still <a href=\"https://www.270towin.com/maps/dQe48\">almost certainly lose</a> if Texas went blue.</p>\n<p>Of course, some of the conditions that led to Democratic victories in 2018 won’t exist in 2020. O’Rourke’s prodigious fund-raising talents allowed him to help his fellow Democrats in competitive districts, but he may not be able to repeat that feat, especially as a presidential candidate. And Trump, for all his negatives, is still more personable than Cruz, who’s so loathed that White House jack-of-all-trades <strong>Mick Mulvaney</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/ted-cruz-reelection-campaign-2018\">told Republican donors</a> Cruz’s “unlikeability” could cost them the Senate race. But for Dickey and Senator <strong>John Cornyn,</strong> who’s keeping the White House abreast of potential red flags, the stakes are too high to take the state’s legacy for granted. As Cornyn told donors, “If Texas turns back to a Democratic state, which it used to be, then we’ll never elect another Republican [president] in my lifetime.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from

look.","body":"<p><strong>Sandra Oh</strong> has been candid about the first time she read the script for BBC America’s <em>Killing Eve.</em> There was momentary confusion, as the Korean-Canadian scanned for the kind of sidelined role typically pegged to women in her demographic. To her surprise, Oh was being courted for the lead, a meaty performance that earned her a Golden Globe statuette last Sunday. Her other coup on the evening was co-hosting the event&#8212;a historic first for someone of Asian descent&#8212;and Oh took on the leading-lady mantle with a beauty look that was resolutely classic. Call it New Hollywood glamour.</p>\n<p>In the run-up to the red carpet, seen here in behind-the-scenes photos, makeup artist <strong>Danielle Vincent</strong> had an unlikely tactic for keeping Oh calm and collected: an ice roller. “It gives us a moment of meditation before we start, and really preps the skin for product,” Vincent said in the maelstrom backstage, moments after Oh’s win. To fine-tune the complexion, she tag-teamed two foundations: <strong>Giorgio Armani’s</strong> <a href=\"https://www.giorgioarmanibeauty-usa.com/makeup/foundation/liquid-foundation/luminous-silk-foundation/A041.html\">Luminous Silk Foundation</a> for the cheeks, and <a href=\"https://www.giorgioarmanibeauty-usa.com/makeup/foundation/liquid-foundation/power-fabric-foundation/A2017.html\">Power Fabric</a> for the T-zone to tamp down any shine. A tap of extra powder was key: “Particularly for this kind of awards show, you need to be matte under those lights.” For dramatic effect, she applied a double layer of Japanese lashes&#8212;a recent haul from Tokyo&#8212;and subtly filled in the brows with Kimiko’s <a href=\"https://www.kimikobeauty.com/shop/makeup/brows/super-fine-eyebrow-pencil-automatique.html\">Super Fine Eyebrow Pencil</a>. A side-parted set of curls by <strong>Ted Gibson</strong> completed the modern Marilyn effect.</p>\n<p>Even as the awards show unfolded in a blur&#8212;three dresses, three lipsticks, one heartfelt acceptance speech&#8212;Oh radiated a kind of incandescence that made you wonder if her parents (winsome in the audience) raised her with traditional beauty know-how. Vincent can attest to at least one ritual: the full-body scrub-down at the Korean spa, where she and Oh have gone for some serious exfoliation. “She jokes, ‘My mom scrubbed me down as a kid with an S.O.S pad, basically,’” Vincent reported with a laugh. Judging from the gleaming skin across the red carpet Sunday, you can say that’s a beauty secret with staying power.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Nothing says

Opponents","promoHed":"Trump Workshopping Strategy to Psychologically Devastate Opponents","dek":"They’ll never see it coming.","promoDek":"They’ll never see it coming.","body":"<p>On Tuesday morning, <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/bernie-sanders-2020.html\">announced</a> his intention to run for president in 2020, bringing the number of Democratic contenders to <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_candidates,_2020\">at least a dozen</a>, with even more waiting in the wings. At a time when <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> approval rating is still sitting stubbornly <a href=\"https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/michael-w-chapman/trump-approval-gallup-44-7-points\">below 45 percent</a>; a record number of Americans are citing “poor leadership” as <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/poor-leadership-hits-record-high-presidents-day-poll-one-third-blaming-donald-1334844\">the biggest problem facing the U.S.</a>; a majority of voters think his fake “national emergency” <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trumps-national-emergency-declaration-unpopular-among-majority-of-americans\">was a historically dumb move</a>; and evidence of his mental impairment <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-national-emergency-declaration-wall\">is piling up daily</a>, you might expect the incumbent to be somewhat worried about his chances of winning a second term. The president, however, isn’t troubled in the slightest, because he reportedly has a can’t-lose strategy for slaying his opponents. No, it doesn’t involve  passing an infrastructure deal or some other piece of legislation Americans actually want, nor does he have plans to lay off the unhinged tweeting or stop sabotaging Obamacare or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/1/8/16865588/report-trump-work-schedule-7-hours\">to start rolling into the office before 11 A.M.</a> No, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/79143c8042aa436ca2d9cfbc708f6d96\">this is so much bigger than all of that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Inside the West Wing and in conversations with outside allies, Trump has been workshopping . . . attempts to imprint his new adversaries with lasting labels, according to two people on whom the president has tested out the nicknames. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with the president. He is also testing out lines of attack in public rallies, exploring vulnerabilities he could use against them should they advance to the general election.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, that’s right: when Donald Trump says he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094940049697849345\">works harder</a> than any other president in history, he’s not just talking about the hardscrabble labor of watching <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/364094-trump-watches-at-least-four-hours-of-tv-per-day-report\">up to eight hours of TV a day</a> and tweeting “witch hunt!” without any context; he’s also apparently referring to the exercise in which he subjects people to first drafts of his comedy routines like he’s dropping by the Laugh Factory unannounced to test out some new bits. Presumably, his writing process involves furiously scribbling notes on the back of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/07/rex-tillerson-trump-undisciplined-doesnt-like-read-tries-do-illegal-things/\">whatever briefing he elected not to read</a>, crossing them out, and asking the oil paintings of his predecessors what they would go with when it comes to Kamala Harris, Sanders, etc. (“Crazy Bernie? Wacky Bernie? I don’t know, Abe, I just don’t know.”) And, sadly for America, he’s testing out his material on a group of people who will intentionally pee their pants at anything he says if it means they can stay in his inner circle.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even in the midst of the partial government shutdown . . . tweets mocking <strong>[Elizabeth] Warren</strong> were widely joked about by White House staff weary from the protracted closure, according to one aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations. The person said the president repeatedly ridiculed Warren’s video in private conversations with aides and outside advisers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Confirming that Trump’s master plan to win a second term involves branding opponents with such genius sobriquets as “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/10/10/trump-mocks-liddle-bob-corker-says-senator-was-made-to-sound-a-fool/\">Liddle <strong>Bob Corker</strong></a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/27/politics/trump-pocahontas-navajo-code-talkers/index.html\">Pocahontas</a>,” White House spokesman <strong>Raj Shah</strong> told the Associated Press: “The president has an ability to use social media to define his opponents and influence the primary debate in a way no sitting president before him has. I expect him to take full advantage.”</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Correction: Trump cares <em>deeply</em> about presidential candidates being treated with thoughtfulness and respect</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/1097947399123857409\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/1097947399123857409\">https://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/1097947399123857409</a></p></blockquote></div><p>In related news, on Tuesday the national press secretary for Trump’s re-election <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kayleighmcenany/status/1097859668507062273\">tweeted</a> that a vote for Bernie is a vote for a socialist dictator. “Bernie Sanders has already won the debate in the Democrat primary, because every candidate is embracing his brand of socialism,” <strong>Kayleigh McEnany</strong> told her followers on behalf of the campaign. “But the American people will reject an agenda of sky-high tax rates, government-run health care, and coddling dictators like those in Venezuela. Only president Trump will keep America free, prosperous, and safe.”</p>\n<p><strong>Well this doesn’t sound great</strong></p>\n<p>What’s worse than a report that disgraced national security adviser <strong>Mike Flynn</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/flynn-backed-plan-transfer-nuclear-tech-saudis-may-have-broken-n973021\">allegedly</a> tried to “transfer sensitive nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia” that could allow the kingdom “to produce nuclear weapons that contribute to the proliferation of nuclear arms throughout an already unstable Middle East?” The news that investigators fear the deal is still under consideration in the Trump White House, despite Flynn’s firing and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/us/politics/michael-flynn-guilty-russia-investigation.html\">guilty plea</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just days after Trump’s inauguration, backers of the project sent documents to Flynn for Trump to approve, including a draft Cabinet memo stating that the president had appointed <strong>[Tom] Barrack</strong> as a special representative to implement the plan and directing agencies to support Barrack&#39;s efforts, the report says. . . . Career national-security officials objected to the plan, citing what they deemed Flynn’s conflict of interest, and also that the proposal sought to bypass a policy review that is required whenever nuclear technology is transferred to another country, the report says.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The proposal, which involved enlisting the U.S. nuclear-power industry to build nuclear plants across the Middle East, was backed by a group of retired generals who formed a firm called IP3. Flynn described himself in financial disclosure filings as an “adviser” to a subsidiary of IP3, IronBridge Group Inc., from June 2016 to December 2016&#8212;at the same time he was serving as Trump&#39;s national security adviser during the presidential campaign and the presidential transition, the report says.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We’ll give you two guesses re: the motivations behind the deal, but you‘ll definitely only need one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The report quotes one senior Trump official as saying that the proposal was “not a business plan,” but rather “a scheme for these generals to make some money,” and added, “O.K., you know we cannot do this.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The White House and Flynn did not respond to NBC News’s request for comment.</p>\n<p><strong>Those G.O.P. tax cuts not going exactly as planned</strong></p>\n<p>Unless the plan was to give taxpayers a heart attack, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/19/i-owe-how-much-americans-are-shocked-by-the-impact-of-trumps-tax-law.html\">in which case things are going very, very well</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first tax-filing season under the new federal tax law is proving to be surprising, confusing&#8212;and occasionally frightening&#8212;for some Americans, especially those accustomed to getting money back from the government. Take <strong>Andy Kraft</strong> and <strong>Amy Elias</strong> of Portland, Oregon. The couple had grown comfortable getting a small refund each year, a few hundred dollars or more. Then they found out they owe $10,160 this year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I will never forget the moment, I thought, ‘We look good,’ and then we added in the next W-2 and my jaw hit the floor,” Kraft said. “There was no way I wanted to believe that what I was looking at was accurate.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To be fair, experts say that the legislation will result in the majority of Americans seeing a reduction in taxes (and the über-wealthy seeing a <em>big</em> reduction in taxes), but because the law required employers to change their withholding, they might have gotten a little too much in their paychecks, hence the sizable bill from the I.R.S. (Also throwing a wrench into people’s expectations: the elimination of personal exemptions and the limiting of a number of popular deductions.) While some argue that a large refund means the government was holding onto too much of your money throughout the year, many Americans have come to rely on and expect the cash infusion. As <strong>Richard Thaler,</strong> recipient of the 2017 Nobel Prize in economic studies, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/02/14/693976808/anger-confusion-over-dwindling-refunds-is-trumps-tax-plan-to-blame\">told</a> NPR, most people won’t notice a slight increase in their paycheck, but they <em>will</em> notice a bill come April. And when you’re hoping to run for re-election in part on your “big, beautiful tax cuts,” the proliferation of hashtags like #GOPTaxScam and #GOPTaxScamStories probably doesn’t help your case, nor does mansplaining about the issue by a punk First Son:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/thevpwright/status/1094100005638627328\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thevpwright/status/1094100005638627328\">https://twitter.com/thevpwright/status/1094100005638627328</a></p></blockquote></div><div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1095426705467027456\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1095426705467027456\">https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1095426705467027456</a></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>If Hedge Funds Are Lagging, Why Do They Have So Much Money?

His Dentist Appointment","dek":"To direct attention to the situation at the border, the former Senate candidate has engaged in a creative&#8212;and perhaps ill-advised&#8212;spectacle, from his facial hair to his oral hygiene.","promoDek":"To direct attention to the situation at the border, the former Senate candidate has engaged in a creative&#8212;and perhaps ill-advised&#8212;spectacle, from his facial hair to his oral hygiene.","body":"<p>How can <strong>Beto O’Rourke,</strong> the Texas Democrat who failed to unseat Republican Senator <strong>Ted Cruz,</strong> continue to command attention? He has already skateboarded on-camera; dipping into that well too often can drown a person in embarrassment. He can’t “break the Internet” à la <strong>Kim Kardashian,</strong> or not-so-secretly marry a troubled young pop star à la <strong>Hailey Baldwin.</strong> He can’t rage haphazardly in all caps on Twitter from a position of tremendous power à la that other guy. He has some credibility to maintain.</p>\n<p>So when O’Rourke has a message he’d like to deploy&#8212;which, at present, is this: the president may declare a national emergency at the border, but, uh, we’re all good down here&#8212;he might as well spotlight the inside of his mouth. How often do you get to see the inside of a politician’s mouth? Especially one getting poked and prodded with metal implements.</p>\n<p>Yes, O’Rourke really broadcasted his most recent dental experience on his Instagram stories. “Ahhh&#8212;so,” he said, as a hygienist removed buzzing tools from his mouth. “I’m here at the dentist.” And he was. The technician, <strong>Diana,</strong> spoke about how “the neighborhood really helped her [mother] out” when her mother, an immigrant, was studying to get citizenship. You only had to endure the inside of Beto O’Rourke’s mouth for a second, and, really, novelty is the soul of spectacle.</p>\n<p>From this post, it’s also clear that O’Rourke has a beard now. Evidently, the former congressman&#8212;a handsome man in his forties&#8212;has decided to unveil his rugged side. Everyone must decide for themselves whether it looks good; we’re all on our own personal journeys.</p>\n<p>But either way, O’Rourke is not alone in his hirsute pursuit. The man he recently lost an election to, Cruz, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/11/ted-cruz-beard\">has a beard now as well</a>. Why the rush to man’s natural state? Well, when worn by a famous man who doesn’t usually have one, a beard might help get attention. But scruff can also be deployed for other reasons: to manifest great sorrow or loss; to attract a mate; out of sheer laziness, or a fierce desire to separate chin and neck, or as a signal that the beard-wearer is bound by no pedestrian concerns, and wants see how patchy his face would be if he just stopped shaving.</p>\n<p>At first glance, neither Cruz nor O’Rourke’s trenchant facial hair appears to have anything to do with loss. Unless one believes that despite Cruz’s win in votes, he’s a loser in spirit. On this, all sides can agree; it might actually be the only thing all sides can agree on.</p>\n<p>Or maybe that particular beard exists to shore up Cruz’s small winning margin&#8212;an attempt to make the sitting senator seem more likable. That move could have worked, too&#8212;his face has more <a href=\"https://twitter.com/damonagnos/status/1083586316107825152\">structure</a> with the beard. It has a salt-and-pepper distinction. He looks like a different person, which is a good thing for Ted Cruz. It could have afforded him a fresh start with constituents&#8212;except that in classic Cruz fashion, the senator air-balled his potential win almost immediately by tweeting something so dopey on Wednesday that it’s hard to read:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1083030582291058689\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1083030582291058689\">https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1083030582291058689</a></p></blockquote></div><p>“Pretty cool . . . Perhaps a bit much”!</p>\n<p>O’Rourke, meanwhile, has not commented on his own beard, thank goodness. But if he did, I imagine he’d say something like, “Oh, this old thing?” Then, pleased to have your attention, he would talk about something useful.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212;

When asked what her first move would be in office, Gillibrand was a little vague; she promised to “restore what’s been lost” to the White House, including integrity and compassion, and to unite our long-divided Congress by appealing to shared values. It’s a promise voters have certainly heard before, but Gillibrand cited the moment when she and her New York colleagues passed the bipartisan 9/11 health bill as proof that she can actually reach across the aisle to get things done. She also noted that she once worked with Texan Senator <strong>Ted Cruz</strong> to unanimously pass a bill to combat sexual harassment in Congress.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for believing in something so much you were willing to talk to Ted Cruz,” Colbert quipped.</p>\n<p>Gillibrand also took a moment to slam <strong>Donald Trump</strong> over the government shutdown, calling his actions “outrageous.”</p>\n<p>“He’s created this crisis himself,” she said. “And he shouldn’t be having a temper tantrum because he can’t get what he wants. . . . Shutting down the government is hurting people. Right now, he’s doing it because he wants his way. If you’re going to do something like that, you better be fighting for other people, not for yourself.”</p>\n<p>As Colbert bid his guest farewell, he gave her a basket full of parting gifts to help her on the campaign trail: an ear of corn to appeal to Iowa voters, a baby doll to kiss on the forehead, a slab of granite for New Hampshire, and some mustard-based barbecue sauce to appeal to voters in his own home state, South Carolina. But most importantly, he gave her a plane ticket to Michigan&#8212;“so you will campaign there.” It was an obvious dig at Clinton, whose 2016 campaign was criticized for not doing enough work in the Great Lakes State. Also included in the gift basket? A special pin emblazoned with the words “I Announced on <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.</em>”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A red carpet <a

summer, it’s time to brace ourselves for an inevitable deluge of retrospectives and meditations. Some will be somber&#8212;and some, like <em>The Haunting of Sharon Tate,</em> will be . . . a little more sensationalistic.</p>\n<p>As seen in the thriller’s first trailer, <strong>Hilary Duff</strong> plays the late actress Sharon Tate, whom the Manson Family murdered along with four other people in the home she shared with her husband, <strong>Roman Polanski.</strong> Tate was eight months pregnant at the time of her murder in August of 1969. From this first trailer, it seems <em>The Haunting of Sharon Tate</em> will mine the atrocity for jump scares and edge-of-seat tension&#8212;artistic choices that could earn the film some criticism from those who might find the approach too cavalier, considering the grisly and traumatic real-life story that inspired it. Tate’s sister <strong>Debra</strong> has already called the film “<a href=\"https://people.com/movies/sharon-tates-sister-slams-hilary-duffs-film-classless/\">classless</a>.”</p>\n<p><em>The Haunting of Sharon Tate</em> is actually just the first film in a series, with <a href=\"https://shadowandact.com/the-haunting-of-nicole-brown-simpson-film-on-sale-at-cannes-casting-for-o-j-and-kids\"><em>The Haunting of Nicole Brown Simpson</em></a> set to follow. It’s also not the only Manson-inspired project for this year&#8212;unsurprisingly, given the anniversary. The most anticipated of these projects is <strong>Quentin Tarantino’s</strong> <em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,</em> which stars <strong>Margot Robbie</strong> as Tate&#8212;but the ramp-up to this true-crime milestone arguably began last year, with productions including <em>Inside the Manson Cult: The Lost Tapes,</em> which featured <strong>Liev Schreiber.</strong></p>\n<p>True crime has continued to prove itself a ratings draw in recent years, particularly for streamers like Netflix. The streaming giant has found viral success with the docuseries <em>Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,</em> and is <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/netflix-zac-efron-ted-bundy-drama-extremely-wicked-1203127942/\">reportedly bidding</a> for the Bundy-inspired Sundance film <em>Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile</em> starring <strong>Zac Efron.</strong> Even the licensed fictional series <em>You,</em> which Netflix picked up after Lifetime canceled it, has become a self-reported <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/netflix-you-bird-box-viewers-numbers\">ratings smash</a>&#8212;which is probably why Netflix recently decided to revive <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/unsolved-mysteries-netflix-reboot-shawn-levy\"><em>Unsolved Mysteries</em></a> as well. What can we say? Crime doesn’t pay&#8212;unless the ratings and/or box office are good.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Our critic on why movies are <a
