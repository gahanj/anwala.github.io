This year, it was Abrams, a liberal African-American woman from Georgia who has championed Medicaid expansion and voting rights. The difference says a lot about how the party has changed in 12 years, and how it perceives the country having changed.</p>

<p>A coalition of Republican attorneys general have on several occasions filed lawsuits in federal court to try to block provisions of the Obama administration&rsquo;s health care program, including a February 2018 lawsuit. A Texas judge in December 2018 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/health/obamacare-unconstitutional-texas-judge.html">struck down the entire Affordable Care Act</a> based on this lawsuit.

<p>The Trump administration has refused in court to defend crucial provisions of the Affordable Care Act that protect people with pre-existing medical conditions. In a court case filed by Texas and 19 other states, the Justice Department has said these provisions should be invalidated because they were part of an unconstitutional scheme that required most Americans to carry health insurance. The administration also supported efforts by congressional Republicans in 2017 to dismantle the health law and weaken its protections for pre-existing conditions.</p>
