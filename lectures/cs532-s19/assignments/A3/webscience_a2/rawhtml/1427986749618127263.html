his hometown of Riyadh, Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman,</strong> the fresh, young face of reform-minded authoritarianism in Saudi Arabia, arrived in the United States last month on a mission to sell his vision for a post-oil utopia on the Arabian Peninsula. Fortunately, the power brokers in Washington, Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and Hollywood, were more easily subdued than the crown prince&#x2019;s political enemies back home. Whereas Salman&#x2019;s rivals had to be imprisoned in a five-star Ritz-Carlton until they relinquished their assets, America&#x2019;s elites were won over with the more traditional combination of wining, dining, and financing from the sovereign wealth fund that M.B.S., as the prince is known, now controls.</p><!-- react-empty: 223 --><p data-reactid="224">The final leg of the epic, three-week roadshow saw M.B.S. hobnobbing in Los Angeles, where industry moguls jostled to capitalize on the conservative kingdom&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-43663447">newfound openness to Western entertainment</a>. On Wednesday night, M.B.S. was welcomed to a <a href="https://pagesix.com/2018/04/05/saudi-prince-attends-star-studded-feast-in-hollywood/">Hollywood dinner</a> hosted by producer <strong>Brian Grazer</strong> and his wife <strong>Veronica,</strong> alongside William Morris Endeavor boss <strong>Ari Emanuel,</strong> who is finalizing a deal with M.B.S. for a <a href="http://deadline.com/2018/03/saudi-arabia-fund-endeavor-stake-talks-400-to-500-million-1202243920/">$400 million</a> stake in Emanuel&#x2019;s talent agency. The guest list was saturated with executives, including Amazon&#x2019;s <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/new-establishment-list-disruption">Jeff Bezos</a>,</strong> Disney&#x2019;s <strong>Bob Iger,</strong> Patriots owner <strong>Robert Kraft,</strong> and <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/did-evan-spiegel-just-nuke-snapchats-comeback">Snapchat&#x2019;s</a> <strong>Evan Spiegel,</strong> as well as tech entrepreneur <strong>Kobe Bryant,</strong> whom the prince reportedly made a special request to meet. Having traded his traditional ceremonial garb for a suit, M.B.S. kibitzed with former Trump aide <strong>Dina Powell</strong> and Vice co-founder <strong>Shane Smith;</strong> discussed the exploding use of Snapchat in Saudi Arabia; and asked Kobe how he got his Oscar. Topics that were deemed off-limits included the 32-year-old&#x2019;s bombing campaign in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians; his abduction of Lebanon&#x2019;s prime minister, <strong>Saad Hariri,</strong> in November; and the decidedly un-Hollywood-like repression of independent media and journalists, one of whom was recently <a href="https://cpj.org/2018/02/saudi-journalist-jailed-for-five-years-for-insulti.php">imprisoned for five years</a> for &#x201C;insulting&#x201D; the royal court.</p><!-- react-empty: 225 --><!-- react-empty: 226 --><p data-reactid="227">Prince Mohammed must have been tired when he returned to the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills, which he had booked in its entirety. The Grazer dinner came just two days after another soiree at <strong>Rupert Murdoch&#x2019;s</strong> Bel-Air estate where, according to <em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/saudi-prince-dines-rupert-murdoch-bob-iger-as-his-entourage-takes-selfies-stars-1099134">The Hollywood Reporter</a>,</em> fellow guests included Iger and his wife; Universal film chairman <strong>Jeff Shell;</strong> Fox TV exec <strong>Peter Rice</strong> and film-studio chief <strong>Stacey Snider;</strong> as well as actors <strong>Morgan Freeman,</strong> <strong>Michael Douglas,</strong> and <strong>Dwayne &#x201C;The Rock&#x201D; Johnson.</strong> Before guests sat down, M.B.S. reportedly delivered a brief speech that touched on his hope to return Saudi Arabia to a more open, moderate form of Islam (the crown prince has blamed Iran for Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s long history of fostering extremism). After dinner, the tone was less somber, and members of the royal entourage could be found taking selfies with various actors.</p><p data-reactid="228">Of course, selfies and state weapons go hand-in-hand, and so, while in California, M.B.S. was also set to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/04/saudi-crown-prince-to-meet-lockheed-martin-ceo-hewson.html">tour</a> defense-giant Lockheed&#x2019;s Silicon Valley complex before concluding his trip. One of Lockheed&#x2019;s top clients, the Saudis expressed their intent last year to procure more than $28 billion worth of Lockheed-made combat ships, aircraft, and missile-defense systems over the next decade. &#x201C;Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy nation, and they&#x2019;re going to give the United States some of that wealth, hopefully, in the form of jobs, in the form of the purchase of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,&#x201D; <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/donald-trump#intcid=dt-hot-link">Donald Trump</a></strong> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/20/saudi-arabia-wants-to-buy-these-american-made-weapons.html">said</a> last month, when M.B.S. visited the White House. The two had already forged a relationship in May of last year, when Trump, quite literally, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/donald-trump-dances-to-saudi-arabias-tune">danced to Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s tune</a>, in a traditional <em>ardah</em> sword dance. (His undulations were smoothly followed by a raft of business deals, including for $110 billion in weapons over the next 10 years.) The political glad-handing portion of the trip was rounded out with meetings in New York with <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/bill-clinton#intcid=dt-hot-link">Bill Clinton</a>,</strong> <strong>Henry Kissinger,</strong> and former mayor <strong>Michael Bloomberg.</strong></p><p data-reactid="229">But it was in California, home of sun, fun, and re-invention, that Prince Mohammed shone brightest. Even The Rock, who has confirmed there is &#x201C;a real possibility&#x201D; that he will one day run for president, found his adroit faculties befuddled upon leaving the Murdoch estate. &#x201C;An historic night it was. A pleasure to have a private dinner with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, his royal family and distinguished cadre,&#x201D; he enthused on Instagram, before apparently thinking better of it and deleting his heart-fluttering coda: &#x201C;On a personal note, I was extremely flattered and truthfully, blown away to be told about the level of love the Saudi people have for me and my popularity throughout the country. Very humbling and cool and I look forward to my first visit soon to Saudi Arabia.&#x201D;</p><div class="mvt-variant" style="min-width:1px;min-height:1px;" data-cn-variation="_8550255229"

off a kidnapping spree in his hometown of Riyadh, Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman,</strong> the fresh, young face of reform-minded authoritarianism in Saudi Arabia, arrived in the United States last month on a mission to sell his vision for a post-oil utopia on the Arabian Peninsula. Fortunately, the power brokers in Washington, Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and Hollywood, were more easily subdued than the crown prince&#x2019;s political enemies back home. Whereas Salman&#x2019;s rivals had to be imprisoned in a five-star Ritz-Carlton until they relinquished their assets, America&#x2019;s elites were won over with the more traditional combination of wining, dining, and financing from the sovereign wealth fund that M.B.S., as the prince is known, now controls.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>The final leg of the epic, three-week roadshow saw M.B.S. hobnobbing in Los Angeles, where industry moguls jostled to capitalize on the conservative kingdom&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-43663447\">newfound openness to Western entertainment</a>. On Wednesday night, M.B.S. was welcomed to a <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2018/04/05/saudi-prince-attends-star-studded-feast-in-hollywood/\">Hollywood dinner</a> hosted by producer <strong>Brian Grazer</strong> and his wife <strong>Veronica,</strong> alongside William Morris Endeavor boss <strong>Ari Emanuel,</strong> who is finalizing a deal with M.B.S. for a <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2018/03/saudi-arabia-fund-endeavor-stake-talks-400-to-500-million-1202243920/\">$400 million</a> stake in Emanuel&#x2019;s talent agency.

Having traded his traditional ceremonial garb for a suit, M.B.S. kibitzed with former Trump aide <strong>Dina Powell</strong> and Vice co-founder <strong>Shane Smith;</strong> discussed the exploding use of Snapchat in Saudi Arabia; and asked Kobe how he got his Oscar. Topics that were deemed off-limits included the 32-year-old&#x2019;s bombing campaign in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians; his abduction of Lebanon&#x2019;s prime minister, <strong>Saad Hariri,</strong> in November; and the decidedly un-Hollywood-like repression of independent media and journalists, one of whom was recently <a href=\"https://cpj.org/2018/02/saudi-journalist-jailed-for-five-years-for-insulti.php\">imprisoned for five years</a> for &#x201C;insulting&#x201D; the royal court.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>Prince Mohammed must have been tired when he returned to the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills, which he had booked in its entirety.

Grazer is one of those celebrities instantly recognizable by his hair&#8212;an iconic, spiky, porcupine creation of many, many splendors. But it is, of course, just hair. âMy hair doesnât have the slightest impact on any script or director or talent; it doesnât change the marketing of a movie or the opening-weekend grosses,â the producer of <em>A Beautiful Mind</em> and <em>Apollo 13</em> once wrote in <em>Vanity Fair</em>. âBut it made a lot of people&#8212;some of them important people&#8212;really uncomfortable. Now, imagine the reaction, the resistance, when you do something different in an arena where it really matters. But I donât want to do the same kind of work everyoneâs doing.â\n<p>Judging from the dozens of awards given to the films and television shows heâs produced along with his creative partner, Ron Howard, Grazer clearly doesnât want to repeat himself. His works span seemingly infinite genres, from <em>8 Mile</em> to <em>Splash</em>, <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> to <em>Empire</em>, <em>Arrested Development</em> to <em>The Cat in the Hat.</em> As of 2012, the films heâs produced with Imagine Entertainment have grossed more than $13 billion.</p>\n<p>Grazer, aware of his status at the top of the industry, views his hair more as a creativity shibboleth to separate the curious from the people who just want to capture the Grazer magic (and, most likely, the Grazer box-office profits). âCuriosity can give you the courage to be adventurous and ambitious&#8212;and different.

Sometimes on steroids, other times subdued, but always in his distinctly recognizable iconography, his designs straddle fine and commercial art, making him a pop culture phenomenon.</p>\n<p>Yet Donnelly, who looks at least a decade younger than his age (44), is softly spoken and modest, and winces visibly at this description. Never mind that he has more Instagram followers than most artists on the planet (todayâs truest mÃ©tier of relevance), that he is housed in some of the worldâs most celebrated collections, has floated his work in Macyâs Thanksgiving Day Parade, and even caused the Museum of Modern Artâs website to crash upon the release of one of his limited edition toys. âI donât ever worry about not being cool,â he shrugs and pauses, deadpan, âbecause everyone knows Iâm not!â His laughter echoes through the studio.</p>\n<p>Without question, KAWS has had an extraordinarily colourful career, often compared to <strong>Keith Haring</strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/1988/11/jean-michel-basquiat\">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a></strong>, who also started out as <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/london/photos/2018/09/new-york-openings-hotels-bars-restaurants-exhibitions\">New York</a> graffiti artists and married street, pop and fine art. After working in animation, he launched Original Fake, his iconic brand whose flagship shop in Tokyo helped catapult the cult of KAWS internationally. Hipsters clamoured for his Companion toys, with the skull and crossbones face, Mickey Mouse-esque body and signature XX eyes.</p>\n<p>But Donnelly realized no one was seeing his original work. âI had written off the idea of galleries because I would meet people and they would like the work, but felt they wanted me to be a commercial artist or a fine artist. I was very guarded and wanted to make what I wanted to make.â</p>\n<p>Donnelly applies the same level of commitment to a toy, a character for a Dior runway show made of 70,000 flowers, or a 28ft floating sculpture. In the back of his studio, a 900kg bronze sculpture has just been completed and awaits naming. It is a greyscale Companion holding an electric blue âBFFâ in the manner of <strong>Michelangelo</strong>âs PietÃ , an incongruous but striking amalgamation of the Old Master and the new.</p>\n<p>âI wasnât looking at Michaelangelo or that sculpture when creating it. I wanted to make something that really felt like loss,â muses Donnelly. In his day, Michelangelo was considered a sellout by skeptics who frowned upon his commissioned works for being commercial. When I suggest the two artists share a few things in common, Donnelly is quick with a self-deprecating reply. âOh yes, me and Michelangelo. Did he make toys and T-shirts with Uniqlo too?â</p>","rubric":"KAW Blimey","socialTitle":"Portrait of an Artist: Brian Donnelly Kaws","socialDescription":"Dorian May tracks down one of the most

In the piece, Singer is also accused of rape. Singer called the story a âhomophobic smear pieceâ in a <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/bryan-singer-allegations-sex-underage-boys-1203115090/\">statement</a>, and has denied all of its charges.</p>\n<p>But when one of Mayâs followers told the musician after the article dropped that he needed to unfollow Singer on social media, May replied, âYou need to look after your own business and stop telling me what to do. And you need to learn to respect the fact that a man or woman is innocent until proven guilty.â Itâs that reply that May soon apologized for.</p>\n<p>âI was shocked and saddened to realise what I had done by my hasty and inconsiderate IG reply to this lady yesterday,â May <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtC0bhZhfeH/\">wrote</a>.

I had absolutely no intention of doing that.â</p>\n<p>âI guess I must be naive, because also it had never occurred to me that âfollowingâ a person on Instagram could be interpreted as approving of that person,â May continued. âThe only reason I followed Bryan Singer was that we were working with him on a project. That situation came to an end when Mr. Singer was removed during the shooting of the film, but I suppose unfollowing him never occurred to me as a necessity. Now, because of this misunderstanding, I have unfollowed.

Singer is also <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/bryan-singer-still-attached-to-direct-red-sonja-remake-despite-allegations\">still attached</a> to direct the forthcoming film <em>Red Sonja,</em> despite the allegations made in the <em>Atlantic</em> report.</p>\n<p>âThe over $800 million <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em> has grossed, making it the highest-grossing drama in film history, is testament to [Singerâs] remarkable vision and acumen,â <em>Red Sonja</em> producer <strong>Avi Lerner</strong> said in a statement.

through the ebbs and flows of show business. On Thursday, Dunkleman said that he is now an Uber driver&#8212;after TMZ <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2019/01/03/former-american-idol-host-brian-dunkleman-uber-driver-divorce/\">reported</a> on his ongoing divorce and allegedly discovered that career detail in his financial documents. Dunkleman responded to that move by tweeting about it, saying he chose to switch jobs so he could spend more time with his son.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/briandunkleman/status/1080996041044877313\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/briandunkleman/status/1080996041044877313\">https://twitter.com/briandunkleman/status/1080996041044877313</a></p></blockquote></div><div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/briandunkleman/status/1081000908807376896\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/briandunkleman/status/1081000908807376896\">https://twitter.com/briandunkleman/status/1081000908807376896</a></p></blockquote></div><p>âI chose to stop doing standup comedy and started driving an Uber so I could be there for my son as much as he needed after our life as we knew it was destroyed,â he tweeted. He followed that up with: âAnd I make over a grand on a good week motherfuckers. @TMZ @HarveyLevinTMZ #HumanBarnacles.â</p>\n<p>That follow-up tweet came in response to TMZ reporting his financial earnings, saying that he makes <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2019/01/03/former-american-idol-host-brian-dunkleman-uber-driver-divorce/\">âaround $800â</a> a week. After co-hosting <em>American Idol</em>âs first season, Dunkleman landed parts in shows like <em>My Name Is Earl</em> and <em>Ghost Whisperer.</em></p>\n<p>This isnât the first time in recent months that a former industry figure has had to defend themselves for working a regular job. <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/geoffrey-owens-cosby-show-actor-trader-joes-photos-interview-good-morning-america\">In August,</a>, Geoffrey Owens, an actor who once appeared on <em>The Cosby Show,</em> was photographed working at Trader Joeâs. After the story was positioned by some as an embarrassing fall from grace, many&#8212;including folks like <strong>Judd Apatow</strong> and <strong>Terry Crews</strong>&#8212;leapt to his defense, saying there was nothing wrong or undignified about what Owens was doing&#8212;which, again, was just working a normal job at a grocery store!</p>\n<p>âI got to the point that I needed to take a job to pay my bills, to support my family&#8212;it was basically that,â Owens said in <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/04/entertainment/geoffrey-owens-interview/index.html\">a later interview</a>. âI wanted a job that had some flexibility, so that if I did stay in [the] entertainment industry, if I could continue to audition and do jobs if I could, and Trader Joeâs provided that.â</p>\n<p>After the story went viral, Owens took a âtemporary leave of absenceâ from Trader Joeâs. However, he was later <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2018/09/geoffrey-owens-recur-tyler-perrys-the-haves-and-the-have-nots-1202459537/\">offered</a> a 10-episode stint on <strong>Tyler Perryâs</strong> <em>The Haves and the Have Nots,</em> which he accepted.

Somewhere below office-martyr messaging, though, is the ineluctable truth that no matter how hard you work, death will always work harder. <strong>Brian Rea,</strong> illustrator of the <em>New York Times</em>âs popular âModern Loveâ column, meditated on that idea for years before turning it into his first book, <em>Death Wins a Goldfish,</em> out on February 5.</p>\n<p>âI had just started working a job at a newspaper in New York, working in the daily section as an art director, and my father, at the same time, had just retired,â Rea told <em>Vanity Fair,</em> explaining the bookâs origins. âI remember asking him right after that, âDo you have any advice for me as Iâm starting to this universe?â And he just said two words: âWork less.ââ</p>\n<p>His father happened to be the hardest worker Rea knew, so the exhortation came as a surprise. âI started to think, O.K., well, heâs suggesting to work less, but who works the most? And that kind of sat with me for a while, and then, if you crunch the numbers, I suppose death would probably be the one that works the hardest.â He started doing little Grim Reaper drawings in a sketchbook, sans words. âOh, thatâs kind of funny,â Rea would think. âMaybe Iâll pitch that to <em>The New Yorker</em> or something.â</p>\n<p>Eventually, with the help of his publisher, Chronicle Books, the sketches added up to a book of his own&#8212;a handwritten diary of Death taking a year-long sabbatical. Readers will encounter our hero, Grim, kindly nudged into a vacation, then checking in with âworkâ (the obituary section), dating, going to college, performing karaoke, taking in art at the museum, and, yes, winning that goldfish at the state fair.</p>\n<p>Below, Rea talks about his process of writing and illustrating his first book, compulsively making lists, âModern Love,â and what itâs like to work so hard on a book confronting the impulse to work so hard.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Vanity Fair:</em>  The book has this playful tone thatâs akin to a childrenâs book, and I know you recently had a kid. Were those two things related?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Brian Rea:</em> Yeah, I think they really are. Part of the two overlapping is about how special time is now. I donât wanna say precious&#8212;but I tend to be a bit more efficient with time in the studio, because I wanna race home and hang out with the little guy and spend time with my family now. Itâs not that I didnât recognize the value of it before; itâs more that itâs front of the mind now.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of moments in the book where there are things that my two-year-old son has done, [where] Iâve watched him and said, âOh, thatâs gonna make it into the book.â . . . There was one about studying ants walking across the floor, something that every home probably has had. It was a little moment, this little nugget in life that somehow kind of worked its way into the book as an idea.</p>\n<p><strong>How else did you decide what Death was going to do during his time off?</strong></p>\n<p>Iâm a compulsive list-maker, so I had plenty of material, and I dumped it all on [the bookâs editor] <strong>Bridget [Watson Payne],</strong> and said, âWhat do you think,â in the hopes that she might edit some of it down. Of course, sheâd just responded back, âLooks great. Start working.â Which is also great, too, because I just dove into it . . . some of the ideas are based, obviously, on straight-up humor&#8212;just trying to tell a funny story&#8212;and other ones are a little bit more insightful, a bit more about trying to mirror our lives or my life, certainly, and then some of them are existential ones.</p>\n<p>I donât think I really asked anyone for suggestions or ideas. In the end, we probably had about 180 images and we narrowed it down. I think the book is 162 pages, so we had to trim some of the items out. I feel like the book could be twice as long [and] tell even more stories, but obviously time is always a thing thatâs hanging over your head.</p>\n<p><strong>Maybe thereâs a sequel in there somewhere.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, exactly. I keep joking that the book nearly killed me&#8212;it wouldâve been really ironic if I had died, especially with a book about living more.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you settle on the goldfish as the main signifier for Deathâs sabbatical?</strong></p>\n<p>The title was the thing that we struggled with probably the most. Everything else kind of fell into place, but the title was the one that was a real challenge. We couldnât really find something that was working I think for everyone. I had been suggesting titles that sounded too much like self-help books and Bridget was like, âThose sound too much like self-help books.â There was one called âDying to Live,â but it just sounds so grim and Bridgetâs like, âThat&#39;s horrible!â Iâm like, âYeah, youâre right. Itâs kind of bad.â</p>\n<p>But I was so convinced it was amazing. You know that thing where you&#39;ve been sitting with an idea forever and youâre like, âNo, itâs perfect! Nothingâs wrong with it!â And then it takes someone to kind of slap you across the face, âItâs a really, really bad idea.â</p>\n<p><strong>The minute you say it out loud to someone else you see it in their face.</strong></p>\n<p>That was exactly what it was. She was great about being straight and honest with me about a lot of those things. I think what we ended up doing was, she had sent some things to me and I wasnât crazy about those, and I said, âLetâs just take a weekend and see what we come up with.â And one of them was the section of the book where Death goes to the state fair, and wins this goldfish. Thereâs something about it thatâs sweet and innocent, but thereâs a tinge of sadness, because weâve all seen people win goldfish at the carnival, and we know what ultimately ends up happening to those goldfish, right? Not to be a spoiler, but the goldfish doesnât die. He doesnât get flushed down the toilet.</p>\n<p>[Thereâs a] contrast between Death, who obviously everyone knows&#8212;the clichÃ©&#8212;and the most innocent thing that he could become friends with, which is this goldfish. In that contrast, I think, is the sweetness and the beauty that I was at least trying to aim for. And the fact that theyâre little buddies also makes Death a bit more human. You start to feel more empathy because you can see that he has feelings and cares for this thing. If people can feel empathy for a scribbled dark line, somehow I feel like Iâve done my job.</p>\n<p><strong>Youâve said that illustrating for the [âModern Loveâ] column has changed you as an artist. What is your process for making the illustrations? Were there any that had a particular impact on you?</strong></p>\n<p>I tend to get the columns on Saturday, Iâll read them over the weekend and just sit with them, and then Monday and Tuesday Iâll sketch, and then Tuesday and Wednesday Iâll do the finished work for them. That weekend, the Saturday-Sunday, those are kinda like the crying days. Just reading through them and kinda just sitting with them a little bit, âcause some of them, as you know, are pretty heavy. Love is about so many more complex things than just hearts and cupcakes.</p>\n<p>But there have been a couple. There was one about a woman who was in her late eighties and she met a man running, and I wanna say he was in his nineties, and they bonded over running, but there was something really sweet about how it was written, just talking about the joy of running [and] the connection she made with someone late in life, and the man ultimately passed away. This idea of running fast, but also at the end of your life . . . it was just so sweet and special, and Iâm in tears reading this thing, but also thinking how beautiful it was, too.</p>\n<p>There was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/fashion/a-writers-tortoise-leads-the-way-to-happiness-modern-love.html\">one that was actually quite funny</a>, this woman who was absolutely in love with her pet turtle, and she couldnât seem to find a guy who measured up to her pet turtle. For that one, I did that scene from <em>Titanic</em> with <strong>Leo.</strong> The girl is standing out in front of the ship with her arms spread out, and the turtle is in front with its arms spread out.</p>\n<p><strong>Before we go, is there anything you want to leave us with?</strong></p>\n<p>The only thing that I keep telling everyone thatâs seen it is that itâs not a book about death. Itâs a book about living. Thereâs this clichÃ© image of what death is, heâs always wearing that black robe and quietly marching through the world, [but] I think the book is trying to do more than that, and hopefully it does for some people.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Marriage and the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/prince-harry-marriage-healthy-yoga-meditation?inline\">mellowing of Prince Harry</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Hereâs our criticâs <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/the-souvenir-movie-review-tilda-swinton-joanna-hogg?inline\">favorite film out of Sundance</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; How Brandi Carlile became the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/grammy-nominated-brandi-carlile-on-female-headlining-music-festival?inline\">2019 Grammysâ most-nominated woman</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; A visual depiction of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/donald-trump-melania-anniversary-slideshow?inline\">Donald and Melaniaâs unique commitment to one another</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Books","socialTitle":"For His First Book, the Illustrator of the New York Timesâs âModern Loveâ Column Took on a Grim Subject","socialDescription":"Just remember that Brian Reaâs Death Wins a Goldfish is ânot a book about death.

Thereâs a new <em>Genius</em> in town&#8212;and she brings with her a trunk stuffed with fur coats and iconic songs. Nat Geo has revealed that the third subject of its anthology docuseries will center on Aretha Franklin, a.k.a. the Queen of Soul, whose death this past summer prompted a flood of appreciations, fond remembrances, and above all, acknowledgments of her monumental contributions to music.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/02/genius-aretha-franklin-greenlighted-season-3-nat-geo-series-suzan-lori-parks-showrunner-1202553998/\">Deadline</a> reports that the announcement came Sunday at T.C.A.&#8212;where it was also revealed that Tony Award-nominated <strong>Suzan-Lori Parks,</strong> who became the first African-American woman to receive a Pulitzer Prize for drama in 2002 for her play <em>Topdog/Underdog,</em> will serve as executive producer and show-runner for this season. Also on board as executive producers are longtime Franklin collaborator <strong>Clive Davis</strong> and Atlantic Records C.E.O. <strong>Craig Kallman,</strong> as well as <em>Genius</em> stalwarts <strong>Ken Biller, Brian Grazer, Ron Howard,</strong> Francie Calfo, Gigi Pritzker, Rachel Shane,__ and <strong>Sam Sokolow.</strong> According to Deadline, the series will examine Franklinâs music and career&#8212;her talent, and the impact she had on the world as a civil-rights activist. The project will begin filming this summer, and is expected to debut in early 2020.</p>\n<p>National Geographic previously said that <em>Frankenstein</em> author Mary Shelley would be the subject of <em>Genius</em>âs third season, and Deadline reports that Shelley is still being considered for a future installment of the series. (In truth, itâs probably not a terrible idea for the network to let last yearâs <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mary-shelley-2018\">lackluster <em>Mary Shelley</em></a> fade from public memory before mining her life for another biographical project.) Thanks to the involvement of Davis, Kallman, and Warner Music Group, Deadline notes that the production will even have access to roughly 80 percent of Franklinâs catalog&#8212;including âI Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You),â âChain of Fools,â âDonât Play That Song,â âSince Youâve Been Gone,â and âBaby I Love You.â Expect all of those songs to make an appearance in the project, along with âI Knew You Were Waiting for Me,â âFreeway of Love,â and âSisters Are Doinâ It for Themselves.â</p>\n<p>Davis, who worked with Franklin for decades and spoke at her funeral, told Deadline, âAretha and I shared a 40-year friendship, ever since she cooked me dinner to talk about working together to reinvigorate her career. I am forever grateful to have had the opportunity to collaborate with her and her incredible instrument. She was a gift to the world, one that will last for many generations. I am thrilled to be celebrating her genius with Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, and Imagine.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The <a

Williams.","body":"<p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/08/steven-soderbergh-logan-lucky-rebecca-blunt\"><strong>Steven Soderbergh</strong></a> released a <a href=\"http://extension765.com/soderblogh/33-seen-read-2018\">comprehensive list</a> of every film, book, and television show he consumed in the year 2018&#8212;revealing that, in addition to ingesting the cerebral fare one may expect, the Oscar-winning filmmaker binge-watched over 50 episodes of Bravoâs reality series <em>Below Deck.</em> Soderberghâs interest in the series, which concludes its sixth season Tuesday night, makes sense; like Soderberghâs <em>Sex, Lies, and Videotape,</em> <em>Below Deck</em> is a voyeuristic glimpse into the human condition, sexuality, and neuroses. Except itâs set on a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/photos/2016/07/fabulous-yachts-at-sea-photographs\">superyacht</a>, with theme parties.</p>\n<p>Each season takes place aboard a different vessel in a different breathtaking locale, as the crew caters to a revolving door of always wealthy, mostly drunk, occasionally nightmarish guests. The majority of the crew changes each season&#8212;a reflection of the transient âyachtieâ lifestyle, viewers learn&#8212;but there are a few constants, starting with <strong>Lee Rosbach,</strong> the no-nonsense, silver-goateed ship captain who keeps his crew in line by barking salty one-liners. (âShe let her mouth write a check her ass couldnât cash,â Lee gravely observed, of a crew memberâs recent temper tantrum). When he unwinds&#8212;only after the guests have left the boat&#8212;he does so by enjoying a late-afternoon glass of pinot noir in the hot tub: a bold choice that speaks to his confidence of character.</p>\n<p>The other constant is <strong>Kate Chastain,</strong> chief stewardess since Season 2&#8212;the hard-driving head of guest experience and indoor staff; known for her polarizing management style; wry sense of humor; and masterful theme parties. She is a lightening-fast wit who, like the captain, calls it as she sees it and doesnât suffer fools. (Their rapport is so easy that Chastain teases him by saying, âWeâre the Regis and Kelly of the sea.â) Sheâs also the showâs audience avatar, hilariously analyzing each crew member and hellish guest, and immediately identifying their weaknesses with terrifying accuracy.</p>\n<p>âIâm an amateur sociologist,â Chastain demurred, during a phone call last week. âIâm not judging someone&#8212;Iâm just categorizing them. Itâd be like bird-watching. Like, thatâs a parrot because it has green feathers. Thatâs a flamingo, because it has pink feathers. That guyâs not a yachtie, because heâs got a Rastafarian beanie on.â</p>\n<p>The show has always merged the theoretically highbrow (wealthy guests sipping champagne as they tour Tahiti) and the undeniably lowbrow (crew members hooking up in bunks; temper tantrums; passed-out-drunk guests). But this season has been the most compelling of them all&#8212;thanks to an especially entertaining crew and several jaw-dropping blunders (the perpetrators of which were ejected from the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2005/05/the-yacht-life\">yacht</a> mid-season).</p>\n<p>The season also featured a frightening near-death experience which occurred when deckhand <strong>Ashton Pienaar</strong> was swept overboard after a line wrapped around his ankle and dragged him off the yacht into water. Had a Bravo cameraman not immediately thrown down his equipment to loosen the line, it would have severed Ashtonâs foot and he would have bled to death&#8212;a grim outcome later explained by an uncharacteristically emotional Captain Lee. But because guests were on board, the crew had to go back to work as though nothing had happened.</p>\n<p>âIâve never seen anybody go man overboard in my yachting career,âÂ said Chastain, whose job was to immediately divert the guestsâ attention from the terrifying accident. âI don&#39;t think any of us realized exactly what had happened, since we were all on different parts of the boat at the time. So we just carried on with the charter. After the guests left, once we had time to really go over the incident, I think it was then that we realized how serious it was. . . . Unfortunately, Ashtonâs accident was a strong reminder that weâre doing a real, dangerous job.â</p>\n<p>And no matter how awful an accident may be, the crew cannot let paying guests know about it&#8212;lest they jeopardize their tips. âItâs our job to pretend that accidents donât happen even when they do. There was a fire onboard Season 3,â Chastain explained, referencing chef <strong>Leon Walkerâs</strong> kitchen grease fire. âThat was pretty scary. But for the most part, professionals can mitigate the amount of accidents that happen.â</p>\n<p>The adrenaline factor, Chastain thinks, âis why a lot of our viewers are actually men. I love it when a lady will tell me, â<em>Below Deck</em> is a show that my husband or brother will watch with me.ââ</p>\n<p>The show also gives audiences a glimpse into how the Ã¼ber-rich vacation (and how irritating some of them can be). Chastain estimated that a seven-day charter on the sixth seasonâs <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2010/11/super-yachts-201011\">superyacht</a>, <em>Seanna,</em> would cost guests nearly $500,000. (Guests who agree to be filmed for <em>Below Deck</em> are reportedly offered a 50 percent discount for a three-day charter, according to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5i59tz/im_mark_cronin_tv_producer_most_wellknown/\">a producer</a> on the series.) Chastain has dealt with new-money yacht guests, eager to try all sorts of (crew-exhausting) water toys and perks. Sheâs had to serve kids, dogs, millennials who barely glance up from their phones; sex workers; presumed mobsters; spoiled sorority sisters; celebrities; guests of celebrities who want to take advantage of their once-in-a-lifetime yachting experience by making nonstop requests. And she has had a favorite category of guest: âI love a very wealthy person who has done yachting before, because this isnât new to them. This is just their floating home away from home. Theyâre not there to party, party, party; make the most of it. They just wanna relax.â</p>\n<p>Sheâs also served movie stars, including, in her pre&#8211;<em>Below Deck</em> career, <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio.</strong> âHe came to dinner on a boat that I worked on in St. Barts. He wasnât a guest&#8212;he just walked on, sat at the table for one meal, and walked off.  I think the owners of my boat had met him at the beach club that day and just decided to invite him for a quick dinner,â she said. âHeâs so beautiful in person.â</p>\n<p>The most ridiculous request sheâs received in her yachting career also pre-dates <em>Below Deck.</em> âWe were in the South of France on this partly cloudy day, and every time a cloud would pass in front of the sun, this wealthy yacht owner woman would ask the captain to pull the anchor and move the entire yacht not far, just to get back into the sun,â she said. âAnd then a cloud would move again and weâd have to move the yacht again. She probably spent $100,000 in fuel for her tan.â</p>\n<p>Chastain, a Florida native, got into <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/maiden-documentary-trailer\">yachting</a> after graduating from college with a degree in communications. âI didnât know what I wanted to do, so I thought if I did one year in yachting, that would buy me some time until I figured it out,â Chastain said, some 10 years later. (She wrote about her early yachting experiences in a memoir, <em>Lucky Charming</em>.) Now that sheâs risen to âChief Stewâ rank, she gets a few extra perks. âAt the end of a seven-day charter, the chief usually gets a little thank-you present from guests. I got a very expensive Montblanc pen with a pearl on the end of it, and I worked for one woman who had an incredible closet she was tired of,â she said&#8212;revealing that she ended up with bags of the womanâs Manolo Blahniks and Jimmy Choo shoes, as well as Gucci dresses.</p>\n<p>Each season of <em>Below Deck</em> is filmed over the course of six or seven weeks. This season featured Chastainâs favorite crew sheâs ever worked with. âThey were all fun personalities and, honestly, I wouldâve done another four weeks with that crew at that point. Usually Iâm ready to run off the boat at the end of the season,â she said.</p>\n<p>But Chastain has no idea which cast members will return for future seasons&#8212;she doesnât know until she arrives on deck. If she had to hand-pick three cast members from the current season to return for the next <em>Below Deck</em> charter, though, they would be Ashton, Rhylee, and Laura&#8212;the last of whom showed up more than halfway through the season.  âJosiah is amazing and super helpful,â she explained of her B.F.F. onboard, âbut I feel like Laura and I only got to enjoy working together for such a short amount of time, âcause she came late season. I think Rhylee started on a bad foot with Chandler, so I think she deserves another chance to have a season.â</p>\n<p>When Chastain first appeared on <em>Below Deck,</em> she was hypercritical as she watched each episode, nit-picking superfluous details like her hairstyle. But five seasons into her run on the show, she has only one moment she regrets&#8212;and it airs in Tuesdayâs finale. âAt the end of the final episode, we are having a great time, all so happy, and I start dancing. I do a really dorky move where I do finger guns with my hands, and itâs just so cringey. I was feeling myself, and I thought I looked way cooler than it did.â</p>\n<p>I asked whether Chastain knows that Steven Soderbergh watches <em>Below Deck.</em> âNo, but thatâs amazing,â she said, before revealing that Bravo host (and Chastainâs dream charter primary)  <strong>Andy Cohen</strong> recently alerted her of another unlikely audience member: <strong>Brian Williams.</strong> Apparently, serious journalists and filmmakers alike appreciate the escape <em>Below Deck</em> provides. âMy mom and I have always thought he was the cutest anchor, so I was thinking, âOh my gosh, my momâs going to be so thrilled.â</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/592f2760fd2e613f1d000021.js?muted=1\"></div></div><h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em>âs long and troubled <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/bohemian-rhapsody-oscar-nominations?inline\">road to the Oscars</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; A defense of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/nell-scovell-lean-in?inline\">leaning in</a>, by the co-author of Lean In</p>\n<p>&#8212; The <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/judd-apatow-louis-ck-kevin-hart-crashing-comedy-interview?inline\">Judd Apatow theory of comedy</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; A visual <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/amalia-andrade-book-interview?inline\">guide to heartbreak that will make you laugh</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; A long-overdue win for <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/2019-oscar-nominations-overdue-for-black-filmmakers?inline\">black filmmakers</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hollywood newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"BELOW DECK","socialTitle":"Below Deckâs Kate Chastain on Season 6âs Highs, Lows, and Yacht Horror Stories","socialDescription":"An ode to the Bravo reality show thatâs won over scores of fansâincluding Steven Soderbergh and Brian Williams.","seoTitle":"Below Deckâs Kate Chastain on Season 6âs Highs, Lows, and Yacht Horror Stories","seoDescription":"An ode to the Bravo reality show thatâs won over scores of fansâincluding Steven Soderbergh and Brian Williams.","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","interactiveOverride":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["bravo"],"revisionAuthor":"Julie Miller","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5c4b6d59fe877f02adebb0ef","revision":84,"createdAt":"January 25, 2019 3:11 pm","modifiedAt":"January 29, 2019 4:50 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 29, 2019 4:50 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Hollywood","slug":"hollywood","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fae03af0739cf33e0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Television","slug":"television","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120ae03af0739cf33e2","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"bravo","slug":"bravo","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb91d32b3790c82c9b6b3","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:26 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:26 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:26 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Julie Miller is a Senior Hollywood writer for <em>Vanity Fair</em>âs website.

And on Friday, the streaming company made it clear that it will build on this momentum&#8212;by substantially outbidding competitors for <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/06/ron-howard-hollywood-zen-master\">__Ron Howardâs</a>__ next project, which seemingly has Oscar contender written all over it.</p>\n<p>Netflix is paying $45 million for Howardâs adaptation of the best-selling memoir <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>&#8212;âalmost doubleâ what other backers were offering, according to a new report from <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/01/netflix-hillbilly-elegy-ron-howard-movie-deal-40m-1202541118/\">Deadline</a>. The memoir, from <strong>J.D. Vance,</strong> will be adapted by recent Oscar nominee <strong>Vanessa Taylor,</strong> who co-wrote <em>The Shape of Water</em> with <strong>Guillermo del Toro.</strong></p>\n<p>Vanceâs memoir depicts his familyâs experience with poverty, drug addiction, and abuse in Rust Belt Ohio, and analyzes the âhillbillyÂ cultureâ he grew up entrenched in. After joining the Marines and eventually graduating from Yale Law School, Vance is able to assess the cultureâs strength and weaknesses. He also chronicles the prejudice he encountered against so-called redneck culture&#8212;so much so that he was <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yale-law-school-inequality_us_5772a27ee4b0dbb1bbbc11b9\">careful not to share certain details</a> about his background while attending an Ivy League school. The story also has political relevance&#8212;as <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/books/review-in-hillbilly-elegy-a-compassionate-analysis-of-the-poor-who-love-trump.html\">The New York Times</a></em> wrote in its review, <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> offers âa compassionate, discerning sociological analysis of the white underclass that has helped drive the politics of rebellion, particularly the ascent of <strong>Donald J. Trump.</strong>â</p>\n<p>Howard, who won an Oscar for directing <em>A Beautiful Mind,</em> will direct and produce with his Imagine Entertainment partner, <strong>Brian Grazer,</strong> with plans to begin filming later this year.

(Louis Cartier had a fascination with all things airborne and pioneered the menâs wristwatch in 1904, after his friend, the renowned aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont, complained about the impracticality of a pocket watch in flight.) Now the Bleuâs ladylike counterpart, the Ballon Blanc, has returned, marked by its delicate dial and a solitaire diamond nestled at the four-oâclock curve.

Bob Iger announced that he would retire as Disneyâs C.E.O. in 2016, the companyâs shareholders and board of directors had a collective meltdown, and convinced him to extend his contract to 2018, the second time it had done so. And with the unexpected departure of heir apparent Tom Staggs, thereâs speculation that the board might coax Iger into postponing retirement again.\n<p>And who can blame Disney? How could anyone replace the man who augmented an ailing entertainment business with several miraculous acquisitions&#8212;Marvel, Pixar, and Lucasfilm among them&#8212;and in doing so, tripled the companyâs stock price?</p>\n<p>The drama surrounding his successor may be a sweet vindication for Iger, a former weatherman who was chairman of ABC when in 2000 when Disney boss Michael Eisner tapped him to be president and C.O.O.&#8212;his second-in-command. The appointment created a âconvolutedâ reporting structure, and raised questions about Igerâs âtrue authorityâ and whether it was a ârealâ promotion, with Disney officials âdownplayingâ whether Iger should be considered Eisnerâs heir apparent, according to the <em>Los Angeles Times.</em> But heir apparent he became, replacing Eisner in 2005. On his second day on the job, he audaciously proposed that the company purchase Pixar. âIf I didnât turn Disney Animation around quickly . . . there was a drumbeat that was going to get louder and louder in terms of whether I was worthy of the job and how long I would last and all those things,â he told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> in 2015, pointing out that at the time, the legendary studio had not notched a major hit in years.</p>\n<p>By convincing Steve Jobs to sell Pixar, which had already been in a distribution partnership with Disney for years, Iger not only acquired characters and films to turn into merchandise and really good theme-park rides, he also got creative geniuses John Lasseter and Ed Catmull into the Disney animation family. (One of the results of that union: <em>Frozen,</em> which eventually became the highest-grossing animated movie of all time and permanently lodged âLet It Goâ into the consciousness of a generation.) He repeated the same process with Marvel Entertainment and Lucasfilm, persuading their C.E.O.s that their partnership would be creatively good for both companies, and wildly lucrative as well. They scored both, with <em>The Avengers</em> and <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens,</em> garnering both critical acclaim and smashing all-time box-office records.</p>\n<p>Iger has accomplished plenty of other things in his tenure&#8212;re-invigorating and opening more theme parks, for instance&#8212;but bringing three creative powerhouses into the Disney family, reviving the foundering brand while letting them be them, may be his lasting legacy. âI basically tried to convince [Marvel C.E.O. Ike Perlmutter] that I was a trustworthy guy,â Iger told the <em>Los Angeles Times,</em> recalling the time when he proposed that the family-friendly Disney could also produce superhero movies. âNot only was my handshake good but Iâd be a good steward of his people and the brand.â</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/574374dd614dc9a45cb0a8eb_hive-contributor-profile-bob-iger.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 5:24 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-bob-iger.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-bob-iger.jpg","credit":"By Jason Merritt/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574374ddc1f81aa45c8117f5","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 5:23 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 5:24 pm","description":"Getty: 512948540","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/bob-iger","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/574374dd614dc9a45cb0a8eb_hive-contributor-profile-bob-iger.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 5:24 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-bob-iger.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-bob-iger.jpg","credit":"By Jason Merritt/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574374ddc1f81aa45c8117f5","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 5:23 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 5:24 pm","description":"Getty: 512948540","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"574374c1b09823be03ef3d14","revision":5,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/bob-iger"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Bob Costas Says He Wanted to Talk About Concussions&#8212;So NBC Took Him Off the Super Bowl","promoHed":"Bob Costas Says He Wanted to Talk About Concussions&#8212;So NBC Took Him Off the Super Bowl","dek":"Internal disagreements about the game of football led to the longtime sportscasterâs departure from NBC, according to Costas.","promoDek":"Internal disagreements about the game of football led to the longtime sportscasterâs departure from NBC, according to Costas.","body":"<p>Last month, when <strong>Bob Costas</strong> and NBC formally agreed to part ways, at least one of the reasons for Costasâs departure was obvious: the legendary sportscaster, who had been with the network since 1979, was reportedly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/bob-costas-leaving-nbc\">struggling</a> to find his groove after developing a fraught relationship with football. Now, a new report from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/25914913/inside-story-how-legendary-nfl-broadcaster-bob-costas-ended-excised-football-nbc-espn\">ESPN</a> reveals the degree to which Costasâs outspoken position on traumatic brain injuries and the N.F.L. may have ended his career with NBC.</p>\n<p>As ESPN notes, Costas was known for being outspoken about the major issues within several sports; when steroid use among baseball players became a major story in the 2000s, for example, Costas took a definitive stand. âA friend of mine said . . . âWhether itâs news or sports, you can never go wrong being on the right side of history,ââ Costas told ESPN in a new interview. âI was right about steroids in baseball, and I was the only network broadcaster who even mentioned it. And I mentioned it all the damn time.â (Costas said neither M.L.B. executives nor his network bosses protested his comments at the time.)</p>\n<p>Costas told ESPN that his relationship with football began to sour decades ago. âAs I got closer and closer to the game, I became ambivalent about it,â Costas said. âThe sheer violence of the game, and then the celebration of that violence, even before C.T.E. became a specific issue . . . I just didn&#39;t feel comfortable with that. That felt stupid to me.â Costas did, however, host <em>Inside the NFL</em> on HBO for several seasons, beginning in 2002&#8212;a decision Costas said he justified due to the journalistic freedom HBO gave him in his commentary. When asked why, then, he also agreed to host football programming once more at NBC when the Peacock picked up N.F.L. rights in 2005, Costas said he was being âkind of a good soldier.â</p>\n<p>But as more research emerged regarding brain injuries and football, things became more complicated for Costas. ESPN reports that Costas spoke out on-air about the issue for the first time in 2010: âHereâs the truth,â he said. âAmericaâs most popular sport is a fundamentally dangerous game where the risk of catastrophic injury is not incidental, it is significant.â Costas continued to speak publicly about the issue for years&#8212;even though he knew very well, in his own words, that âthe networks, all of them, dance to the N.F.L.âs tune . . . Everyone walks on eggshells around the N.F.L.â</p>\n<p>It was in 2015 that Costasâs troubles came to a head. As the <strong>Will Smith</strong> film <em>Concussion,</em> a biopic about the forensic pathologist who connected the dots between chronic traumatic encephalopathy and football, prepared for its debut, Costas decided to write another essay in order to help NBC get in front of what he thought would be a nationwide awakening. But when he handed in the essay to NBC brass, Costas said he was told that although it was impeccably written, the network couldnât let him read it&#8212;due to negotiations with the N.F.L. for the rights to broadcast Thursday Night Football. âIt was at that point,â Costas said, âthat I realized that this was an untenable situation for me. I knew my days there were numbered.â The deal did eventually go through, deepening the business ties between NBC and the N.F.L.</p>\n<p>And then came the moment in 2017 when Costas made his infamous statement at a University of Maryland symposium: âThe reality is that this game destroys peopleâs brains,â Costas said. âNot everyoneâs, but a substantial number.â Days later, he was honored by the Concussion Legacy Foundation; soon after, he appeared on CNN to address the subject again, and to make clear that he was not being critical of NBC. After that, he said, he was taken off 2018âs Super Bowl LII broadcast. (A representative for the N.F.L. told ESPN that the league made no request that Costas be removed from NBC coverage.)</p>\n<p>âI recall the phrase, âItâs a six-hour, day-long celebration of football, and youâre not the right person to celebrate football,ââ Costas told ESPN. âTo which my response was not, âOh please, please change your mind.â My response was, âYeah, I guess youâre right.ââ</p>\n<p>NBC has responded to Costasâs claims with a statement to ESPN: âWe have historically given our commentators a lot of leeway to speak on our air about issues and controversies, and Bob has benefited most from this policy. Weâre very disappointed that after 40 years with NBC, he has chosen to mischaracterize and share these private interactions.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212;

run, but <strong>Bob Costas</strong> and NBC have parted ways for good. The legendary sportscaster has been with the network since 1979, and throughout his career has done just about everything, calling or serving as host for sporting events including the Olympics, the Super Bowl, the World Series, the NBA Finals, and the Triple Crown. Now, heâs set to focus on his work with the MLB Network.</p>\n<p>âItâs all settled quietly and happily for all concerned,â Costas told <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/01/15/bob-costas-and-nbc-are-quietly-and-officially-broken-up/\">the <em>New York Post</em></a> Tuesday. âIf I do anything else, it will be a hybrid of my HBO show and <em>Later.</em>â (NBC Sports confirmed the news to <em>V.F.</em>)</p>\n<p>Costas hosted the talk show <em>Later</em> on NBC from 1988 to 1994. His HBO program, <em>On the Record with Bob Costas,</em> followed a similar format and ran from 2001 to 2004 before it rebranded to <em>Costas Now,</em> and ran through 2009 until Costas signed with the MLB Network. Costas told the <em>Post</em> he intends to continue working with the MLB Network; as for any additional work he might do in the future, Costas told the <em>Post,</em> âI have some possibilities, but I have to decide what I want to do.â</p>\n<p>As the <em>Post</em> notes, Costas had struggled in recent years to find roles within NBC that inspired him&#8212;particularly due to his increasingly outspoken position regarding football and the N.F.L. In November of 2017, Costas spoke bluntly about the dangerous sport, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/11/08/bob-costas-future-football-nfl-this-game-destroys-peoples-brains/842904001/\">saying,</a>, âThis game destroys peopleâs brains.â He was not a part of last yearâs Super Bowl coverage, though the game was shown on NBC. Meanwhile, <strong>Mike Tirico</strong> took over Costasâs role during the networkâs Olympics coverage.</p>\n<p>Baseball remains Costasâs favorite sport; last year, he was even inducted into the broadcast wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame. As the <em>Post</em> reports, Costas is expected to play a substantial role in announcing the Hall of Fameâs inductees next week. Whatever else Costas does in the future, however, one thing is certain: his departure from NBC marks the end of an era.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A red

Landgraf, who gained a reputation as a television-industry sage after warning the industry about the coming glut of scripted content (a phenomenon also known as <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/netflix-john-landgraf-peak-tv-diversity\">âpeak TVâ</a>), immediately went on the offensive against Netflix in particular, accusing the streamer of playing an unfair game in which it self-reports ratings while refusing to play by the Nielsen metrics that other networks are bound to.</p>\n<p>Netflix recently proclaimed that <em>You,</em> a series that originally aired on Lifetime before moving to the streaming platform, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/netflix-you-bird-box-viewers-numbers\">was on track to be âwatched by over 40 million member householdsâ</a> in its first four weeks on its new platform&#8212;but Landgraf took issue with that number, saying that the streamer had counted households watching just part of an episode, rather than only considering total viewership per episode. If you applied standard metrics to their data, he claimed, it would look more like eight million viewers per episode&#8212;a respectable number, but not the enormous phenomenon Netflix has reported the show to be.</p>\n<p>âBy reporting their singles as if they were home runs,â Landgraf said, the streamer has misrepresented both the number and the true scale of its hits&#8212;suggesting that it alone has figured out the secret to the TV universe.</p>\n<p>âThe truth will ultimately come out, as it always does,â he quipped.</p>\n<p>In December, FX released a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-peak-tv-fx-2018-report-20181213-story.html\">report</a> suggesting that for the first time, streamers are churning out more original content than broadcast and cable networks: 160 scripted original series ran on streaming services last year (not counting reality shows or kids programs), compared to 146 on broadcast networks and 144 on basic cable. During this panel, Landgraf also noted that FX is âlaser-focusedâ on quality rather than quantity. He pointed out that FX (which expects to become part of Disney following Disneyâs acquisition of major Fox assets) saw 13 of its 14 original scripted series appear on 2018 year-end best lists compiled by critics&#8212;a much higher batting average than competitors like HBO, which saw 20 out of its 70 series represented, or Netflix, which had 62 out of 530 originals on those lists, per FX.</p>\n<p>Landgraf proclaimed again that having a high-quality brand is the best way to cut through the noise of the peak-TV era, especially as streamers proliferate and churn out programming. He also noted, however, that âthe enemy of excellence is time. . . . If you want to get things right, you have to stop sometimes. You have to slow down.â This focus on quality, according to Landgraf, is why FXâs highly anticipated adaptation of <em>Y</em>&#8212;which has finally been ordered to series, with <strong>Diane Lane</strong>  starring&#8212;took longer to come to fruition than some fans had hoped it would. âItâs not an easy adaptation; itâs taken a long time to get it right,â Landgraf said. And though Landgraf critiqued Netflix and the tech industryâs âwinner-takes-allâ attitude, he also noted that he was âreally gratefulâ that FX will soon be part of a powerful streaming platform itself: once Disney acquires Twentieth Century Fox, Disney will hold a 60 percent stake in Hulu.</p>\n<p>This spring, the network will launch <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/fosse-verdon-teaser-trailer-fx-sam-rockwell-michelle-williams\">Fosse/Verdon</a>,</em> a limited series about the creative collaboration and romantic relationship between legendary choreographer and director Bob Fosse (played by <strong>Sam Rockwell</strong>) and Broadway star Gwen Verdon (<strong>Michelle Williams</strong>). The series also boasts mega-talent behind the scenes, including executive producer <strong>Lin-Manuel Miranda,</strong> <em>Hamilton</em> director <strong>Thomas Kail,</strong> <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> playwright <strong>Steven Levenson,</strong> and <em>The Americans</em> show-runner <strong>Joel Fields,</strong> an alum of one of FXâs greatest hits. The network is also premiering <em>What We Do in the Shadows,</em> a half-hour vampire comedy series based on the movie of the same name by co-creators <strong>Jemaine Clement</strong> and <strong>Taika Waititi.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ryan Murphy,</strong> a longtime FX creator who recently decamped to Netflix, may be <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/ryan-murphy-netflix-the-politician-jessica-lange\">luring</a> some of his old FX team over to his new shows&#8212;but Landgraf also promised that his network would host more seasons of both <em>American Horror Story</em> and <em>American Crime Story,</em> though he did admit that a planned season of the latter about Hurricane Katrina, which has had a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/annette-bening-american-crime-story-katrina\">long and torturous production process</a>, is now officially dead.</p>\n<p>Of <em>Crime Story,</em> Landgraf said, âWe have three or four ideas in active development, with writers at work on them. I couldnât tell you which one is likely to be ready first.â (We know, though, that another planned season about <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> and <strong>Monica Lewinsky</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/04/american-crime-story-lewinsky-ryan-murphy\">also been scuttled</a>. And although Murphy has not pitched any ideas for further seasons of <em>Feud</em>&#8212;at least, not since <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/fx-feud-prince-charles-princess-diana\">ditching his <strong>Prince Charles</strong> and Diana-themed season</a>&#8212;Landgraf said, âI wouldnât be surprised if I get a call about another cycle.â</p>","rubric":"TCA","socialTitle":"FX C.E.O.

I apologize.â</p>\n<p>But the actor also seemed eager to rationalize those same remarks, explaining why, in his mind, they were not really worthy of the criticism they have received&#8212;criticism that led Hart to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/oscars-host-kevin-hart-responds-to-criticism\">step down from hosting the Academy Awards</a>, just days after he officially took the gig.</p>\n<p>One of the jokes, for example, involved Hart worrying that his son will grow up to be gay, and trying to prevent that outcome: âEvery kid has a gay moment, O.K.? Every kid. But when it happens, youâve gotta nip it in the bud,&quot; he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggAjqk2Bc3M\">said</a> in an old stand-up special. On Monday, though, Hart noted that the bit started with him saying that he is not homophobic: âI want to say that I have no problem with gay people. I donât have a homophobic bone in my body. I want you to be happy, be gay, be happy. And then I say as a heterosexual male, if I can do something to stop my son . . . thatâs where the joke starts!â he said.</p>\n<p>Hart also indicated that he should be cut some slack because he was not speaking directly to gay people when making his homophobic jokes. âThese werenât words that I said to gay individuals,â he said. âI didnât say these words to people, at the time. This was our dumb asses on Twitter going back and forth with each other. We thought it was O.K. to talk like that, because thatâs how we talked to one another. In that, you go, âFuck! This is wrong nowâ . . . Now, weâre in a space where Iâm around people of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, and Iâm now aware of how these words make them feel, and why they say, âThat shit hurt because of what Iâve been through.ââ</p>\n<p>Hart also promised to support the L.G.B.T.Q. community from now on: âIf the fight from the L.G.B.T.Q. community is equality, thatâs the fight. The fight is the will and want for equality. Iâm riding with you guys. I understand you.â That said, Hart added that fighting for equality also means accepting people even when they make mistakes, as long as they make a good-faith effort to change. âIn the fight for equality, that means that there has to be an acceptance for change,â Hart said. âIf you donât want to accept people for their change, then where are you trying to get to the equal part? Where does the equality part come in?â</p>\n<p>This is the latest protracted segment in Hartâs Oscar departure scandal. Shortly after abdicating his position as Oscar host, he sat down for a long <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/ellen-degeneres-kevin-hart-oscars-host\">interview with <strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a>, who urged Hart to reconsider the hosting gig; she also said that she called the Academy herself to ask if Hart could return to the ceremony. The Academy, DeGeneres claimed, was still very much interested in bringing Hart back into the fold. Hart, who spent most of the interview defending himself from the purported âmalicious attackâ he has suffered over the past few weeks, said he would consider DeGeneresâs plea.</p>\n<p>Hart also received some surprising support from Disney head <strong>Bob Iger,</strong> who told <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/bob-iger-kevin-hart-oscars-host-1203101488/\"><em>Variety</em></a> he was staying âopen-mindedâ about the possibility of Hart returning to the show. But Iger also doesnât think Hart will ultimately end up hosting the Oscars.</p>\n<p>âBased on what Iâve heard and what Iâve read, [Hart] didnât want to subject himself to more of the criticism heâs already received,â Iger said. âI think we just have to accept that outcome.â</p>\n<p>It was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/kevin-hart-turns-down-oscars-hosting-again-despite-ellen-plea\">previously reported</a> that Hart had indeed officially taken himself out of the running again, despite DeGeneres and Igerâs stances. In lieu of a single host, the Academy is instead reportedly lining up stars to M.C. the night as a group&#8212;and keep the fast-approaching night afloat.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity

unbelievable twists and turns of the Jan Broberg kidnapping case, and the pieces of the story that didnât make it into her documentary, on Netflix.","body":"<p><em>Abducted in Plain Sight</em> filmmaker <strong>Skye Borgman</strong> understands why audiences might want to scream at their televisions while streaming her true-crime documentary. The 91-minute film, originally released in 2017, has captivated an entirely new audience since premiering on <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/fyre-festival-documentary-netflix-chris-smith-interview\">Netflix</a> this month. It chronicles the peculiar <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/04/adventures-in-the-ransom-trade\">kidnapping</a> case of <strong>Jan Broberg,</strong> an Idaho teenager who was abducted by her decades-older neighbor Robert Berchtold in the 1970s. But Berchtold&#8212;known as âBâ&#8212;did not just kidnap Broberg once; he entrapped Janâs religious parents in such a web of trust, shame, and complicity that he managed to convince the family to drop the most serious kidnapping charges against him, continue letting him spend disturbing amounts of time with their young daughter, and&#8212;in the most shocking twist of all&#8212;he eventually kidnapped her a second time.</p>\n<p>âIt is incredibly challenging to understand why and how these people went through this, but thatâs part of the story,âexplained Borgman to <em>Vanity Fair,</em> before admitting that even she became so incensed that she eventually had to take a break during the editing process.</p>\n<p>âWe spent so much time with them on the computer, going through what they had said, and [editing] things together,â Borgman continued. âThere were times when the family was just so frustrating to me.â At one point, Borgman and her editor hit pause on the project for a solid six weeks. âIt was the best thing that we couldâve done, because we were able to come back and feel everything we were supposed to feel,â she said.</p>\n<p>It is important to remember that Janâs kidnappings took place in a small town, decades before the Internet and true-crime television franchises turned Americans into armchair experts on such seedy subjects as pedophilia, Stockholm syndrome, and grooming. Borgman explained that the Broberg familyâs faith, as members of the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2012/10/mormon-politicians-lds-church-romney\">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, also gave them an extraordinary capacity for forgiveness&#8212;a subject Borgman would like to explore if she is able to pull together funding for a sequel to <em>Abducted in Plain Sight.</em></p>\n<p>Until then, Borgman shared even <em>more</em> shocking revelations about the Broberg family; Robert Berchtoldâs alien-abduction grooming technique; and the effects the kidnapping has had on Jan as an adult.</p>\n<p><em>Spoilers ahead for those who have not yet seen</em> Abducted in Plain Sight.</p>\n<p><strong>This documentary was the first time Janâs father, Bob, publicly confessed to having his own romantic entanglement with his daughterâs kidnapper.</strong></p>\n<p>Borgman first learned of Janâs kidnapping through <em>Stolen Innocence,</em> a memoir Jan wrote with her mother, <strong>Mary Ann.</strong> But the first edition of the book left out several very pertinent details, such as the affairs both Janâs mother and father had with Berchtold.</p>\n<p>During the preliminary discussions the filmmaker had with Jan, Jan was âpretty forthcomingâ about the affair her mother had with Berchtold. But the filmmaker didnât know about Bobâs own âindiscretionâ until she got ahold of F.B.I. documents and court transcripts.</p>\n<p>âWhen we were going into the interview, I really wasnât sure if I was going to ask him about it,â said Borgman, explaining that Bob volunteered details about the sexual act he performed on Berchtold. âI think Bob realized that it was a critical element to the story, and how [Berchtold] was able to get into their family this way so seamlessly,â said Borgman.</p>\n<p>The âindiscretionsâ will be detailed in a new edition of the Brobergsâ memoir now that, according to Borgman, the family âreally understand[s] the importance of how those two instances led to [Janâs parentsâ] denialâ of Berchtoldâs relationship with Jan. Borgman explained that both Bob and Mary Ann were âso consumed with their own actions and their own trauma that they just didnât pay attention [to their daughterâs relationship with Berchtold] the way that they were supposed to.â</p>\n<p><strong>Berchtold allegedly used his convoluted âalien-abductionâ grooming narrative on multiple victims.</strong></p>\n<p>One jaw-dropping twist in <em>Abducted in Plain Sight</em> occurs during the first kidnapping, when Jan says that Berchtold used a cassette player to trick her&#8212;just 12 years old at the time&#8212;into believing that she had been kidnapped by aliens and that she could save her family only if she accepted a secret mission to procreate with Berchtold. During <em>Vanity Fair</em>âs conversation with Borgman, the filmmaker confessed that she initially had a hard time believing this element to Janâs story.</p>\n<p>âI constantly questioned if this had really happened,â said Borgman. âIf this little box was next to Jan and if these alien voices were really playing through. I got to one point where I was like, âWell, maybe it doesnât matter if itâs real. Maybe this is what Jan has had to tell herself to cope with the situation and get through it.ââ</p>\n<p>âThen, while we were working on the film, one of Berchtoldâs other alleged victims reached out to us and told us a story about him using this alien psychology and saying, âYouâre a princess from a different planet.â He used this whole alien story on her, and that was the moment for me when I thought, âOh my gosh, itâs real. He did it.ââ (Neither this accuser nor the other alleged Berchtold victims that came forward wanted to revisit their ordeal on camera.)</p>\n<p>Asked how Berchtold came up with this extravagant deception plan, Borgman said her only theory is that inspiration struck from the 70s zeitgeist. âThis whole idea of science fiction was popular, and tape recorders had just come out. There were also a lot of newspaper articles about U.F.O.s and whether or not they were real.â</p>\n<p><strong>Even though Berchtoldâs brother Joe was aware of his brotherâs inappropriate behavior, he felt the need to participate in the documentary on Berchtoldâs behalf.</strong></p>\n<p>Borgman interviewed multiple members of Janâs family, but when it came time to reach out to Berchtoldâs immediate family members&#8212;who lived next door to Janâs family growing up&#8212;ânobody really wanted to do an interview.â Explained the filmmaker, âThey werenât interested in dredging up the past.â</p>\n<p>Because Berchtold committed suicide in 2005&#8212;after coming face-to-face with Jan in a courtroom, a bizarre meeting included in the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/oscar-haven-for-female-directors\">documentary</a>&#8212;and is not able to defend himself, Berchtoldâs brother <strong>Joe</strong> felt the need to participate in Borgmanâs film.</p>\n<p>âI donât know that he trusted us completely, but he wanted to give his brother a voice,â said Borgman. âItâs something I think about a lot&#8212;that sibling love and how strong that is. I think that comes out a lot with Joe, that he loves his brother, even though his brother was a pedophile, and I think those two things really are conflicts in him. He still loved his brother.â</p>\n<p><strong>Some crazy details were left on the cutting-room floor.</strong></p>\n<p>To streamline the documentary, Borgman ended up leaving out several story elements&#8212;including a meet-up that Mary Ann had with Berchtold in a parking lot, allegedly involving a gun and Mary Annâs brother. Borgman also consulted with a forensic psychologist, providing her with court transcripts and other evidence of Berchtoldâs fixation with Jan to help her get a professional read on âB.â</p>\n<p>âShe explained how much work it takes to actually kidnap somebody,â Borgman said. âThatâs why it doesnât happen more often, because thereâs so much planning involved, and thereâs so much deceit that goes into it. To be able to actually kidnap somebody is incredibly difficult. Then to be able to maintain this ruse for years and years really takes somebody who has very little empathy for anybody else. It really does take a sociopath.â</p>\n<p>Borgman is hopeful that she can one day make a sequel to this film, âto explore the different topics that we didnât have time to really dive deep into, like the role that faith plays&#8212;maybe not even just <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/04/the-mormon-view\">L.D.S.</a>&#8212;but the role that faith plays in sheltering communities,â said the filmmaker. âAlso grooming and brainwashing&#8212;there are really interesting, intricate things that happen, and we touch on both of those topics in the documentary, but Iâd love to explore those more. I guess in a perfect world, itâd be sort of a trilogy of films.â</p>\n<p><strong>Jan still sees Berchtold as her benchmark for love.</strong></p>\n<p>After her trauma, Jan went on to get married, have a son, and get divorced. As Borgman explained, Janâs relationship with Berchtold, understandably, had lasting effects on her adult life. âIt had a huge, huge impact on her relationship with men,â said the filmmaker. âI remember talking to her at one point, and she said that she still looks at her relationships, and sheâs never felt as in love with any of the men that sheâs been in relationships with as the kind of love she felt with Berchtold. That speaks huge volumes to how impressionable children are&#8212;12-year-old kids, especially. To this day, Jan struggles with how to love and how not to associate that love with the love she felt for Berchtold when she was 12 and 13 years old.â</p>\n<p><strong>Bob and Mary Ann stayed married until Bobâs death in 2018.</strong></p>\n<p>In spite of the trauma of the kidnapping, and the separate âindiscretionsâ husband and wife had with their daughterâs kidnapper, Bob and Mary Ann stayed married until Bob died last November. Asked whether Bobâs affair with Berchtold continued beyond the car incident, Broberg said she isnât sure.</p>\n<p>âWe certainly couldnât find any indication that it continued,â said Borgman. âIt has been a question that a lot of people have asked or posed, and I also find it curious. Iâm not sure that it matters if there was or if there wasnât, because it was this one indiscretion that really gave Berchtold the ammunition he needed to blackmail the head of the household. One time or more than that, the deed was done, and the ramifications of that were set in motion.â</p>\n<p><strong>Jan is now a working actress who has appeared on over 30 episodes of the WB series <em>Everwood.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Jan has gone on to have a successful acting career, appearing in more than 45 film and television projects according to her IMDb page. âShe still auditions, but she started running a theater company in Utah and itâs been wonderful for her,â explained Borgman. âThe press that sheâs getting has been a lot, but sheâs doing really well. . . . She says that you can choose how to live your life. 90 percent of her life is amazing and wonderful, and 10 percent is not, and she chooses to live in the 90 percent. I do give her a lot of respect and a lot of props for doing this documentary and for telling this story, because it&#39;s easy to let that 10 percent creep back in. She just doesn&#39;t allow that to happen.â</p>\n<p>It has, however, been hard for Jan&#8212;and her siblings&#8212;to see their parents criticized in response to the documentary. After the film premiered, however, Janâs father Bob approached the filmmaker with genuine appreciation. âBob said that he was just so grateful that we had told their story in such a sensitive way,â said the filmmaker. âIt was really quite shocking to me and, I think, speaks more to the Brobergsâ capacity for truth and forgiveness and just wanting to get that story out there.â</p>\n<p>Now, in the Internet Age especially, Borgman and the Brobergs want to make audiences âaware of how people can enter our lives, and we need to protect our children a little bit more . . . I think thatâs something that Jan and her sisters have all been advocates for&#8212;getting the word out there that it can happen to somebody close to you, by somebody you know. Donât trust everybody.

Perhaps because <em>A Star Is Born</em> once <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/little-gold-men-a-star-is-born-billy-magnussen\">seemed like a shoo-in for best picture</a>&#8212;but now, as the Academy rounds the final corner to the Oscars, that race looks like anyoneâs ball game.</p>\n<p>Reading his op-ed, it seems clear that Penn is trying to do a solid for a friend. He likes <em>A Star Is Born;</em> he <em>really</em> likes it. Unfortunately, itâs a little difficult to understand that message given Pennâs decidedly idiosyncratic prose style, which professional book reviewers have called â<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/what-is-sean-penn-thinking-his-debut-novel-is-a-mess-again/2018/03/26/d3c2059a-30ff-11e8-8bdd-cdb33a5eef83_story.html?utm_term=.ca0b286b9ac3\">all over the place</a>,â â<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/sean-penn-bob-honey-who-just-do-stuff-review_us_5ab9a1bee4b008c9e5fa89a2\">an exercise in ass-showing</a>,â and â<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/books/review/sean-penn-bob-honey-who-just-do-stuff.html\">a riddle wrapped in an enigma and cloaked in crazy</a>.â</p>\n<p>Listen, writing is hard. I do it every day, and every day I wonder if English really is my first language. But when Penn writes sentences like, âIt has been so long since we have been able to equate a success or a love story with high art or artists that we may well have forgotten how,â what is he really <em>trying</em> to say? Letâs put on our Google Translate hats and try to figure it out.</p>\n<p><strong>âThis isnât Bradley Cooperâs opportunity, itâs theirs to appreciate the depth and value of this film before its legacy outlasts their chance to participate in it.â</strong></p>\n<p>Get it while itâs hot, dummies!</p>\n<p><strong>âHeâs made a film about us as the flawed contemporary characters we are, and while his artfulness has brought it to moviedomâs Super Bowl, it has done so with none of the conceits voters are likely to lean on in the final tally.â</strong></p>\n<p>Good movies donât appeal to Oscars voters.</p>\n<p><strong>âIts art neither panders to the politics of the day, nor dazzles with the deceptions so many delight in.â</strong></p>\n<p>Oy.</p>\n<p><strong>âIn these silly-ass soul damaging times, a film like <em>A Star Is Born</em> brings people together without saccharine, sugar, or salesmanship.</strong></p>\n<p>This is a pretty straightforward sentiment; just wanted everyone to see âsilly-ass, soul-damaging times.â</p>\n<p>__âIt is the achievement of one artist who had the courage to stand naked and jump from the edge of a vertical cliff, bringing his whole cast and crew with him, and simultaneously catch their fall. Itâs a triumph.â</p>\n<p>Penn realized halfway through writing this sentence that bringing a cast and crew over a cliff isnât the right metaphor. Unrelated: why is Cooper naked here?</p>\n<p>__âIn the end, the apples and oranges of film competition, and the inequity of advertising budgets that has always left the Academy Awards with some inevitable aftertaste of the alcohol most of us have to drink to get through them.â</p>\n<p>jhsdfpojfaijasdjlasdjkalknfnssaldsdjinjsdfbjaksbdlk</p>\n<p><strong>âTo spare myself potential disappointment, Iâm raising a glass in advance to Bradley Cooper and <em>A Star Is Born.</em> Surely a raised glass is as legitimate as a globe of gilded gold or a male statuette minus a penis (also gold gilded). God forbid it have balls this year!â</strong></p>\n<p>Honestly, I have no idea. Seems like a long walk to get to a penis joke. But by âgold gilded,â he definitely means gilded.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The <a

danger, crying and laughing simultaneously as he sped off into the great, post-finale unknown. In <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/vince-gilligan-men-of-the-year-kingpin\">later interviews</a>, series creator <strong>Vince Gilligan</strong> would surmise that Pinkman probably got away for good, moving to Alaska and living a peaceful new life. However, he added that itâs also entirely possible that Pinkman got picked up by the feds&#8212;and landed in a heap of fresh hell, which might be more in keeping with the the showâs dark purview. Soon, fans will finally find out what happened to Pinkman for good: according to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/breaking-bad-movie-is-a-sequel-starring-aaron-paul-1159128\"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>, the upcoming <em>Breaking Bad</em> movie is happening, and is also a sequel that picks up where the series left off.</p>\n<p>Sources tell the outlet that Gilligan has written the script himself, and is set to direct and executive produce the film, which revolves around Pinkman (<strong>Aaron Paul</strong>) as he makes a bid for freedom. In addition, Netflix will have first-run rights of the film, which will then air on AMC, <em>Breaking Badâs</em> former network.</p>\n<p>Reports about a <em>Breaking Bad</em> movie <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/breaking-bad-movie-creator-vince-gilligan-works-1158881\">first surfaced in November</a>, with series star <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/08/entertainment/bryan-cranston-breaking-bad-movie/index.html\"><strong>Bryan Cranston</strong> confirming</a> that the project was forthcoming. He quickly dampened hopes of a Walter White appearance, however, by adding that he has not read the script, and doesnât think itâs likely that his character will have any sort of cameo. âI donât know if thereâs an appearance . . . flashbacks, flash-forwards . . . but Iâm <em>excited</em> about it, because itâs <em>Breaking Bad,</em> and it was the greatest professional period of my life&#8212;and I canât wait to see all those people again, even if I just come by to visit,â Cranston said in an interview on <em>The Dan Patrick Show.</em></p>\n<p>Gilligan himself kept mum on the details, as has Paul. Representatives for the show creator and the actor have not yet responded to <em>Vanity Fair</em>âs request for comment. Meanwhile, the <em>Breaking Bad</em> spin-off <em>Better Call Saul</em> is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/better-call-saul-season-4-finale-bob-odenkirk\">still going strong</a> at AMC, for fans who suddenly need a fresh fix of Gilligan-penned drama.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The <a

Given that the president is prone to acting out over the smallest perceived slights or inconveniences&#8212;Twitter asking him to re-enter his password presumably elicits the sort of pitched scream only dogs can hear&#8212;it wasnât all that surprising that he would lose his mind over the fact that, come January, one chamber of Congress wonât be entirely comprised of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2018/08/09/devin-nunes-trumps-political-stooge-is-at-it-again/\">people who would</a> volunteer to apply his self-tanner just to get close to him.

Among the many Trump threads the attorney general-elect plans to yank are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian official, attended by, among others, <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong> and <strong>Jared Kushner;</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Possible violations of the emoluments clause through Trumpâs New York businesses, such as the hotel <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/at-president-trumps-hotel-in-new-york-revenue-went-up-this-spring--thanks-to-a-visit-from-big-spending-saudis/2018/08/03/58755392-9112-11e8-bcd5-9d911c784c38_story.html\">patronized by the Saudi crown princeâs entourage</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/12/trump-grill-review\">the worst restaurant in America</a>;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Allegations of fraud involving the presidentâs real-estate holdings in New York, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-fred-trump-taxes\">outlined by <em>The New York Times,</em></a> such as starting a company that was a vehicle to âsiphon millions of dollars from Fred Trumpâs empire by simply marking up purchases already made by his employeesâ (his lawyer said âthere was no fraud or tax evasion by anyoneâ); and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A continuation of the probe, initiated by Jamesâs predecessor, into the Trump Foundation. (In June, <strong>Barbara Underwood</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/06/trump-foundation-lawsuit\">sued</a> Trump and all three of his adult children for âpersistently illegal conductâ related to the charity.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>James campaigned on passing a bill to change New Yorkâs double-jeopardy laws with an eye on possible pardons coming out of the White House. James told NBC News she wants to be able to pursue state charges against anyone the president were to pardon over federal charges or convictions and whose alleged crimes took place in the state. Under current New York law, she might not be able to do that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>âI think within the first 100 days this bill will be passed,â James said, adding, âIt is a priority because I have concerns with respect to the possibility that this administration might pardon some individuals who might face some criminal charges.â We canât imagine where she <a href=\"https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/donald-trump-jr-has-nowhere-to-run-to-except-his-dad-after-michael-cohens-guilty-plea/\">got that idea</a>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Giuliani: Iâll use White House influence to score contracts with foreign governments until the day I die</strong></p>\n<p>With everything going on this week, from <strong>Michael Cohenâs</strong> sentencing to the ongoing <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> investigation, you might expect presidential lawyer <strong>Rudy Giuliani</strong> to, if not be working round the clock, then at least be in close proximity to his most important (<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/rudy-giuliani-greenberg-traurig-resignation\">and only</a>) client. But you would <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/us/politics/giuliani-consulting-abroad.html\">expect wrong</a>!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Giuliani was in Manama, Bahrain, on Tuesday, meeting with the king and the interior minister of an important United States ally in the Middle East. . . . But Mr. Giuliani was not in Bahrain, a country with a record of human-rights abuses, on official business. He was there to seek a lucrative security-consulting contract with the government.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The trip was part of a concerted push Mr. Giuliani has undertaken in the last few weeks to win business from governments around the world&#8212;including in Africa and South America&#8212;for a firm he owns called Giuliani Security and Safety. . . . In his role representing Mr. Trump in the investigation by the special counsel, <strong>Robert S. Mueller III,</strong> Mr. Giuliani is not a government employee, and is not subject to government ethics rules, including prohibitions on outside work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But as his visit to Bahrain showed, Mr. Giulianiâs various interests can lead to confusion over the nature of his role. And foreign officials who have reason to want to get in or stay in the Trump administrationâs good graces could view hiring Mr. Giulianiâs firm as a good way of doing so, according to ethics watchdogs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, according to the former mayor of New York City, any suggestion that he might be using his association with the president for monetary gain is total bull crap. âIâm probably the most ethical person you ever met,â Giuliani told <em>The New York Times.</em> âI follow all the rules. I have no desire to trade on anything.â Is he feeling the pinch of working for Trump for free? Sure, but this isnât about that. âMy income for this year will be not quite half of what it was last year,â he let reporter <strong>Kenneth Vogel</strong> know. But heâs not complaining, because he still âmake[s] a lot of money.â No, this is about the feeling he gets in his loins when heâs pitching foreign governments on services that the Giuliani Security and Safety team can provide (likely for several million dollars). âIâm 74 years old,â he said, âbut I have the energy of a 25-year-old, and if I were to stop doing this, Iâd die. I love to do this work.â</p>\n<p><strong>Youâll never believe it, but Jared and Ivanka pushed for a tax break they stand to profit from</strong></p>\n<p>Itâs shocking! We know! These people are totally <em>not</em> known for doing this exact type of thing! <a href=\"https://apnews.com/37b731bd1cc443fa953b112b7afe879a\">Per the Associated Press</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At an Oval Office gathering earlier this year, President Donald Trump began touting his administrationâs new real-estate investment program, which offers massive tax breaks to developers who invest in downtrodden American communities. He then turned to one of the planâs strongest supporters. âIvanka, would you like to say something?â Trump asked his daughter. âYouâve been pushing this very hard.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Opportunity Zone program promoted by <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> and her husband, Jared Kushner&#8212; both senior White House advisers&#8212;could also benefit them financially, an Associated Press investigation found. . . . Kushner holds a big stake in a real-estate investment firm, Cadre, that recently announced it is launching a series of Opportunity Zone funds that seek to build major projects under the program from Miami to Los Angeles. Separately, the couple has interests in at least 13 properties held by Kushnerâs family firm that could qualify for the tax breaks because they are in Opportunity Zones in New Jersey, New York, and Maryland&#8212;all of which, a study found, were already coming back.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kushner Cos. did not respond to the A.P.âs requests for comment, while <strong>Abbe Lowell,</strong> a lawyer for the couple, said in a statement that âMs. Trump has divested assets, set up trusts, removed herself from businesses and decisions about her investments. In addition, she adheres to the ethics advice she has received from counsel about what issues she can work on and those to which she is recused.â</p>\n<p><strong>Report: the I.R.S. holds rich people to the same standard as the poor</strong></p>\n<p>Just kidding, of course. Hereâs a <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/earned-income-tax-credit-irs-audit-working-poor\">fun one</a> from ProPublica:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Budget cuts have crippled the I.R.S. over the past eight years. Enforcement staff has dropped by a third. But while the number of audits has fallen across the board, the impact has been different for the rich and poor. For wealthy taxpayers, the story has been rosy: Not only has the audit rate been cut in half, but audits now tend to be less thorough.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Itâs a different story for people who receive the E.I.T.C. [earned income tax credit]: the audit rate has fallen less steeply and the experience of being audited has become more punishing. Because of a 2015 law, E.I.T.C. recipients are now more likely to have their refund held, something that can be calamitous for someone living month-to-month. . . . Generally, the more money you make, the more likely you are to be audited. E.I.T.C. recipients, whose typical annual income is under $20,000, have long been the major exception. Thatâs because many people claim the credit in error, and, under consistent pressure from Republicans in Congress to curtail those overpayments, the I.R.S. has kept the audit rate higher. Meanwhile, there hasnât been similar pressure to address more costly problem areas, like tax evasion by business owners.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>âThose struggling to make ends meet are being unfairly audited while the fortunate few dodge taxes without consequence,â Senator <strong>Ron Wyden</strong> told ProPublica. âThe I.R.S. needs more manpower to go after tax cheats of all sizes, and working Americans need a simpler way of obtaining a tax credit theyâve earned.â</p>\n<p><strong>The president takes the events of the day in stride</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/AdamParkhomenko/status/1072930783004946433\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamParkhomenko/status/1072930783004946433\">https://twitter.com/AdamParkhomenko/status/1072930783004946433</a></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Merry Christmas, everyone</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/TPM/status/1072950379191681024\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TPM/status/1072950379191681024\">https://twitter.com/TPM/status/1072950379191681024</a></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Michael Cohen</strong> Sentenced to 3 Years, Says He Covered Up Trumpâs âDirty Deedsâ (<a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/michael-cohen-sentenced-to-3-years-says-he-covered-up-trumps-dirty-deeds\">The Daily Beast</a>)</p>\n<p>Publisher of National Enquirer admits paying hush money to help Trump ahead of 2016 election (<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/publisher-national-enquirer-admits-paying-hush-money-help-trump-ahead-n947111\">NBC News</a>)</p>\n<p>Banks Get Kinder, Gentler Treatment Under Trump (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-get-kinder-gentler-treatment-under-trump-11544638267\"><em>W.S.J.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Tech Unicorns Leave the Enchanted Forest (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-12-12/unicorns-leave-the-enchanted-forest\">Bloomberg/Matt Levine</a>)</p>\n<p>Senate votes to overturn Trump donor disclosure rule (<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/12/senate-democrats-overturn-trump-donor-disclosure-1057535\">Politico</a>)</p>\n<p>âParents said 8- and 9-year-old students at Flowery Field Elementary School in Hyde, England, arrived for class to find a crime scene had been set up in a classroom, complete with the outline of the murder scene involving an Elf on the Shelf.â (<a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2018/12/12/Parents-disturbed-by-elf-murder-class-assignment/2881544629096/\">UPI</a>)</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The Democrats are facing a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/democrats-face-a-generational-reckoning?inline\">generational reckoning</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; How a movie producer and Hollywood invented <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/how-hollywood-invented-ben-shapiro?inline\">conservative commentator Ben Shapiro</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Real estate, greed, extortion: a true <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/12/jills-miami-real-estate-extortion?inline\">tale of <em>Miami Vice</em></a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Sandra Blandâs sisters are still searching for <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/say-her-name-sandra-bland-documentary-interview\">answers about her death</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; It sure looks like Saudi Arabia <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/trump-hotel-saudi-arabia?inline\">used veterans to funnel money to Trump</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Levin Report","socialTitle":"Incoming New York A.G.

Will their tactics hamstring McCabe&#8212;and Mueller?","body":"<p>The White House finds itself in a familiar position: yet another tell-all book, this one by former deputy F.B.I. director <strong>Andrew McCabe,</strong> is making <strong>Donald Trump</strong> look bad. But this time, the administration isnât just going into damage-control mode, as it did in response to similarly unflattering portraits of the president by the likes of <strong>Omarosa Manigault Newman, Michael Wolff, Bob Woodward,</strong> and <strong>James Comey.</strong> According to an Axios <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/andrew-mccabe-fbi-the-threat-white-house-response-c1ac6445-94ec-4292-94f1-61ead688d89d.html\">report</a>, the administration is plotting to weaponize McCabeâs new best-seller, <em>The Threat,</em> to further the conspiracy theory that the Russia probe is part of a Deep State plot to sink Trumpâs presidency.</p>\n<p>In the book and on his accompanying press tour, McCabe portrays Trump as an incompetent, self-serving agent of chaos&#8212;an assessment shared by countless others in their accounts of his presidency. But McCabe has, in some ways, been even more blunt, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/19/politics/andrew-mccabe-trump-law-enforcement/index.html\">telling</a> <strong>Anderson Cooper</strong> Tuesday evening that he believes âitâs possibleâ that Trump is a Russian asset, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/1097840728934400002\">telling</a> <strong>Savannah Guthrie</strong> that nobody in the bipartisan Gang of Eight had objected when he informed them heâd opened an F.B.I. counter-intelligence investigation into Trump. âThatâs the important part here,â McCabe told Guthrie. âNo one objected. Not on legal grounds, not on constitutional grounds, and not based on the facts.â</p>\n<p>In more normal times, that might have been a bombshell. By now, however, such assessments are virtually par for the course. Rather than sounding alarm bells, it seems inevitable that theyâll be sifted through the partisan filters through which other warnings about this president have been received. For those who distrust Trump, McCabe will confirm their fears. For those who support him, McCabeâs book is more evidence that unseen powers have long been trying to subvert his presidency.</p>\n<p>The White House, it seems, is attempting to use that divide to its advantage, looking to play up passages that make it seem as though a shady cabal of officials has been leading a âwitch hunt.â The effort appears to already be underway: Trump has targeted McCabe with an array of Twitter attacks, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1097469642048716801\">accusing</a> him of plotting a âvery illegal actâ with <strong>Rod Rosenstein</strong> and <strong>Jeff Sessions,</strong> and emphasizing the link between the former F.B.I. deputy and Comey, whom Trump fired in 2017. âRemember this,â Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1097698985953898497\">tweeted</a> Monday, âAndrew McCabe didnât go to the bathroom without the approval of Leakinâ James Comey!â He has also <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-decries-coup-attempt-against-him-n972791\">backed</a> claims by <strong>Dan Bongino,</strong> one of his Fox News buddies, that discussions McCabe said Rosenstein engineered about using the 25th Amendment to declare Trump unfit for office were part of an âillegal coup attempt.â</p>\n<p>The notion that the F.B.I. was engaged in, in the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-decries-coup-attempt-against-him-n972791\">words</a> of <strong>Rush Limbaugh,</strong> a âsilent coupâ against Trump, is a matter one of the presidentâs top allies says he plans to investigate. âWas this an attempted bureaucratic coup? I donât know,â Senator <strong>Lindsey Graham</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-sen-lindsey-graham-on-face-the-nation-february-17-2019/\">said</a> on <em>Face the Nation</em> Sunday. âI donât know who is telling the truth. I know Rosenstein vehemently denied it, but weâre going to get to the bottom of it.â</p>\n<p>That McCabeâs explanation for the origins of the Russia probe is so polarizing raises concerns about how the conclusions of that probe will be received. <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> is expected to release his findings soon, and the presidentâs camp is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/rudy-hates-the-job-trumps-multi-front-war-is-taking-its-toll#~o\">said to be worried</a> about what will come of the investigation, which has already nabbed several top Trump officials. With Democrats controlling the House, an incriminating special-counsel report could indeed pose a threat. But in a stubbornly partisan Washington, where Trump has faced few tangible consequences, itâs far from impossible that whatever Mueller finds could be similarly swept up in partisanship. âI think thatâs why we started our investigation,â McCabe told Cooper on CNN of the presidentâs suspiciously warm relationship with Russia. âAnd Iâm really anxious to see where Mueller concludes that.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/bill-weld-2020-republican-primary-challenge?inline\">mission to stop Trump?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Howard Schultz defends <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/howard-schultz-i-firmly-believe-americans-want-a-president-just-like-me?inline\">his controversial potential presidential bid</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The suspected leaker of Jeff Bezosâs texts has his own <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/suspected-bezos-leaker-supplies-his-own-theory-about-the-affair?inline\">theory about the affair</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Yes, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/kamala-harris-charlamagne-tha-god-inhaled?inline\">Kamala Harris did inhale</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The shocking details behind the double <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/abducted-in-plain-sight-netflix-jan-broberg?inline\">kidnapping of an Idaho teen</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Russia Investigation","socialTitle":"The White House Has a Plan to Smear Andrew McCabe","socialDescription":"Trump and his allies are on the offensive.

(On January 6, <em>Green Book</em> also <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/golden-globes-2019-green-book\">won</a> the Golden Globe for best comedy/musical.)</p>\n<p>The road-trip movie, which tackles race-relations through the lens of the two-month journey shared by pianist Dr. Don Shirley (<strong>Mahershala Ali</strong>) and his Italian-American driver, Tony âThe Lipâ Vallelonga (<strong>Viggo Mortensen</strong>), seems to be proving its staying power despite criticism for its antiquated look at race, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/more-green-book-controversy-for-screenwriter-and-director\">the insensitive comments</a> made by its screenwriter and producer <strong>Nick Vallelonga</strong>&#8212;who did not attend the nightâs festivities and was not thanked in remarks by Farrelly&#8212;and the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/truth-about-green-book-viggo-mortensen-mahershala-ali\">anger of Shirleyâs family members</a>, who were not involved in the making of the film.</p>\n<p>Farrelly (<em>Dumb and Dumber,</em> <em>Thereâs Something About Mary</em>) took his moment on the stage to reiterate how lucky he feels after making gross-out comedies for the past 25 years, films that made lots of money but never landed him a seat at a table such as the one he was seated at during the event. âThis is my first time at the P.G.A. Awards. In fact, itâs the first time I ever heard of the P.G.A. Awards,â he said. âI want to thank Dr. Donald Shirley and Tony Vallelonga for leading these lives that were so beautiful&#8212;to relive and to tell about&#8212;and who touched so many people and made so many people better because of your existence.â</p>\n<p>Because the Producers Guild employs a similar voting process to the Oscarsâ preferential system, and features many members who are also part of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Saturdayâs win serves as a solid barometer for Oscar night, a fact that gives films like <em>A Star Is Born,</em> <em>Black Panther,</em> and <em>Roma</em> a heavier set of odds to counter in their quest for the big prize.</p>\n<p>Still, the choice felt a bit out of touch with the rest of the evening, which spent the majority of its four-hour running time honoring voices that have helped raise up the voiceless, including the indelible <strong>Norman Lear,</strong> who was honored by <em>Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em> creator <strong>Amy Sherman-Palladino</strong> when she took home the Norman Lear Achievement Award, saying, âAnyone who has spent any time in a comedy room knows you spend your early career, mid-career, and late career talking about Norman Lear.â</p>\n<p>Lear, the 96-years-young producer of <em>All in the Family</em> and <em>The Jeffersons,</em> then presented his friend, TV producer-creator <strong>Kenya Barris</strong> (<em>Black-ish</em>), with the P.G.A.âs Visionary Award. âI love the show, I love the man, I love everything about the way he has wished to present the world as he sees it,â Lear said of Barris, before adding, âThis has been the most delicious evening I can remember. Do you know how many evenings Iâve spent in this room? I always felt laughter adds time to your life. This evening had to have added time to mine. So youâre going to see me for a couple more years.â</p>\n<p>âThis is my friend,â said Barris of Lear. âNot kinda my friend. This is my boy. We hang. We talk . . . I look at this room and Iâm pretty sure Iâm the most surprised that Iâm here. Coming from where I came from, this is never something in a million years I could have even thought about dreaming about. Norman and his work is why Iâm here. He made a kid from the âhood feel seen. And thatâs what I decided to do, to make people feel seen. . . . The stories are being told by the people who have lived the stories.

And the P.G.A. paid tribute to the iconic <strong>Jane Fonda</strong> with its Stanley Kramer Award, recognizing her years of combining her art with activism and philanthropy. When given the award by <strong>Mary Steenburgen</strong> and <strong>Ted Danson,</strong> Fonda revealed her three guilty pleasures on TV: <em>The Good Place</em> (which stars Danson), <em>Sex Education,</em> and <em>Atlanta.</em> She also complimented the female producers who put together the night, including P.G.A. Presidents <strong>Gail Berman</strong> and <strong>Lucy Fisher.</strong> âThe reason this set is so great, and the food is unusually good, is because women organized this,â Fonda said, before marveling that most of the honorary awards given out are named for producers she knew personally. âItâs fun being old. Itâs hard being young.â</p>\n<p>Fonda added, âIâm told [the P.G.A.] is almost 50 percent women. And itâs not that we are better, we just donât have our masculinity to prove.

staple and <em>Incredibles 2</em> director Brad Bird expressed astonishment at the wide array of Oscar-nominated talent on display in the best-animated-film category this year: âYou have stop-motion, hand-drawn, and a mixture of techniques in <em>Spider-Verse.</em> Itâs exciting! If these film succeed and get attention, it will create an even wider-open field for other films to come. People will feel like they donât have to do just one style of animation. The kind of people getting into animation now&#8212;itâs really spreading.â</p>\n<p>Peter Ramsey, who co-directed <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em>&#8212;the likely front-runner for the award&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-oscar-front-runner\">echoed</a> Birdâs enthusiasm for the varying styles on display in the category this year: âYou could ask any of the guys who are nominated with us. [They want] to bring a more human hand-made feel to animation.â And a closer look at this yearâs inspiring and innovative nominees proves their point. These films employ a variety of exciting techniques to fully immerse audiences in imaginative universes, from a fantastical Japanese wonderland to a retro-futuristic superhero playground, a remote island inhabited only by canines to a cartoonish cyber universe, and, of course, to an alternate dimension&#8212;or several. Here, the minds behind all five explain the method to their endlessly creative madness.</p>\n<h2><strong><em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em></strong></h2>\n<h3>Directors: Rodney Rothman, Peter Ramsey, Bob Persichetti</h3>\n<p>Inspired by Spider-Manâs 50-plus years on the comic-book page, the animation team behind <em>Into the Spider-Verse</em> took a radical approach to the origin story of Miles Morales&#8212;combining the freedom of modern C.G. animation with the artistry of comic-book illustration. Marvel Comics artists painted over animated frames that included classic comic-book elements like thought bubbles, Ben-Day dots, and hatching; meanwhile, the filmâs background blur and occasional magenta and cyan lines indicating a depth of field were production designer Justin Thompsonâs nod to the dye bleed that occurs when comic-book âpages are printed off register.â As director Rodney Rothman says: âWe were taking things that were mistakes in comic books and making them part of the language of the movie.â Sony ended up so pleased with the filmâs distinct style that the studio is taking the unprecedented move of trying to patent the innovative technologies used on <em>Into the Spider-Verse.</em></p>\n<h2><strong><em>Ralph Breaks the Internet</em></strong></h2>\n<h3>Directors: Rich Moore and Phil Johnston</h3>\n<p>Thanks to innovations in the world of C.G. animation in the six years since <em>Wreck-It Ralph,</em> that filmâs sequel was able to capture the full scope of the Internet, and include Disney animationâs largest number of character models for a single film: over 400 unique figures and close to 7,000 variants, including a massive swarm of Ralphs that combined to form the third-act villain, âRalphzilla.â Head animator Kira Lehtomaki found the task of updating the animation styles of 14 classic Disney princesses, including Snow White, Mulan, Moana, and more, to be âterrifying,â but she enjoyed being able to finally give the original Cinderella her first pair of ears&#8212;all the better for her to hear the clock strike midnight.</p>\n<h2><strong><em>Mirai</em></strong></h2>\n<h3>Director: Mamoru Hosoda</h3>\n<p>Even as the rest of the animated world races towards C.G.-driven technological innovation, Japanese houses like Studio Ghibli and <em>Mirai</em>âs Studio Chizu distinguish themselves through their traditional, hand-drawn-on-paper style. But director Mamoru Hosoda says his story of a young boy and his sister, who travel through time via an enchanted garden, may be one of the very last Japanese films done in this style&#8212;as budgetary concerns and a lack of new artists trained in the technique are making it impossible to pursue across the countryâs filmmaking industry. Even in <em>Mirai</em> itself, Hosoda introduces a number of different animation styles&#8212;including C.G.-generated effects&#8212;to convey some of the more surreal aspects of this time-hopping adventure.</p>\n<h2><strong><em>Isle of Dogs</em></strong></h2>\n<h3>Director: Wes Anderson</h3>\n<p>Like much of Wes Andersonâs work, <em>Isle of Dogs</em> is an intentional throwback. Not much has happened, innovation-wise, in the meticulous field of stop-motion animation since Anderson and lead animator Jason Stalman collaborated on 2009âs <em>Fantastic Mr. Fox.</em> If anything, Stalman says, Anderson insisted on styling the film to look more overtly lo-fi than comparable projects at studios like Laika or Aardman, encouraging elements like the erratic-looking movement of hand-manipulated dog fur. Moments like this are meant to serve as a nod to the simple, spare style of hand-drawn Japanese classics like Hayao Miyazakiâs <em>Spirited Away</em> and <em>Howl&#39;s Moving Castle;</em> they also ensure that audiences can really âfeel the animatorâs hands,â Stalman says, as they watch a pack of canine heroes save the day.</p>\n<h2><strong><em>Incredibles 2</em></strong></h2>\n<h3>Director: Brad Bird</h3>\n<p>The world of Pixar animation technology has grown by leaps and bounds since Mr. Incredible and his super-family first sprang into action in 2004. At the time, Brad Birdâs film represented Pixarâs first foray into the world of animating human characters, but over a decade later, itâs about the minute detailing that can go into Bobâs grimaces or every strand of Violetâs trademark hair. More crucially, producer Nicole Grindle says, Pixar is able to add lighting to its C.G.-animated work much, much sooner in the process, which allows Bird and his team more room for experimentation. In the past, it was âtoo expensive to go backâ and tweak shots past a certain stage in animation, says Grindle&#8212;but now Bird is able to attack his action-packed sequences from multiple angles, with a freedom thatâs much closer to that of live-action filmmaking.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/the-worst-kept-secret-of-trumps-presidency?inline\">worst-kept secret</a> of Trumpâs presidency</p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Silicon Valley suffocating the media?

In Murdochâs media empire, which includes News Corp. and Twentieth Century Fox, everything revolves around him. Hundreds of newspaper properties around the world lead back to the Australian-born billionaire, who has been credited with âinventing the modern tabloidâ in the course of his ascendancy from local broadsheet owner to global news baron.\n<p>Murdoch started small, taking the Southern Australian <em>Adelaide News,</em> the family-owned daily he received upon his fatherâs death, and turning it into a regional success. Still in his early 20s, Murdoch expanded quickly, buying up other newspapers and boosting their numbers with his trademark focus on sex, sports, and scandal.</p>\n<p>Over the next several years, his empire grew to include media properties in New Zealand, Britain, and finally, the United States, where he bought the <em>San Antonio Express-News,</em> founded the supermarket tabloid <em>Star,</em> and eventually purchased the <em>New York Post</em> and publisher HarperCollins. In the 1980s, he extended his dominion to include television, too, buying a stake in Twentieth Century Fox and, in 1990, forming British Sky Broadcasting (now known as Sky, the U.K.âs largest pay-TV broadcaster).</p>\n<p>Murdoch, now in his 80s, has an aggressive editorial sensibility that has made him a bÃªte noire to some. On the left, he is often pilloried for his conservative ideology, which he has worked to popularize through right-leaning outlets like <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and Fox News. And his inclination to court controversy has sometimes crossed into the criminal realm: in 2011, Murdochâs <em>News of the World,</em> among other companies, was accused of bribery and phone hacking to get scoops, leading to him being investigated by both the British government and the F.B.I. In 2012, he resigned as director of News International and from several other companies connected to it. (Murdoch doesnât shy from more personal scandals either, divorcing his third wife, Wendi Deng, amid rumors she had an affair with Tony Blair, and recently marrying former model Jerry Hall, 25 years his junior.) In 2015, it was announced that Murdoch would be stepping down as the C.E.O. of 21st Century Fox, handing his two sons, James and Lachlan, the keys to the kingdom. Still, Murdoch by all reports is still firmly in charge of his empire, despite frequent questions about a plan of succession.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/01/574f478f0f807a3a48c7150a_hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg","credit":"From REX/Shutterstock.","_links":{},"id":"574f478fb1a9903a488277a2","createdAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/rupert-murdoch","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/01/574f478f0f807a3a48c7150a_hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-rupert-murdoch.jpg","credit":"From REX/Shutterstock.","_links":{},"id":"574f478fb1a9903a488277a2","createdAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:37 pm","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"574f479cbdf148e4205f29e5","revision":0,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/rupert-murdoch"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"âYou Canât Just Be All Fox Newsâ: An Old Murdoch Lieutenant Is Back to Help Figure Out the <em>Post</em>âs Trump Coverage","promoHed":"âYou Canât Just Be All Fox Newsâ: An Old Murdoch Lieutenant Is Back to Help Figure Out the <em>Post</em>âs Trump Coverage","dek":"Can Col Allan, the swashbuckling and bibulous tabloid star of the aughts, help the <em>New York Post</em> decode its most important reader?

It has the longest history with the current occupant of the White House of any publication&#8212;Trump first emerged as a larger-than-life character in the <em>Post</em>âs pages some 30 years ago. The <em>Post</em> is reportedly still Trumpâs favorite and first-read paper, and Trump has a close rapport with its owner, <strong>Rupert Murdoch,</strong> who reportedly talks to the president on a regular basis. In its modern history, the <em>Post</em> has always been seen as a conservative title, with red-meat opinion pages and a special delight in skewering liberal politicians, but it is also very much a New York paper, with a strong constituency of power players in politics, business, and media who lean to the left. âWhen you go to a hotel or to Michaels,â said one veteran political operative, âthe <em>New York Post</em> is almost always an equal with the <em>Times</em> and the <em>Journal,</em>â which Murdoch also owns. âItâs a widely read and deeply influential newspaper.â</p>\n<p>Perhaps more than any other of his American journalistic assets, Murdoch has used the <em>Post</em> to get involved in the political game, put his chips down, and signal his pleasure or displeasure. And just as Murdoch has been confused about Trump, so has the <em>Post.</em> Unlike the overall vibe of the primetime lineup at Murdochâs Fox News, the tabloid hasnât been shy about <a href=\"https://www.showbiz411.com/2018/01/18/conservative-murdoch-papers-ny-post-and-wall-street-journal-go-harder-on-trump-than-anyone\">taking shots at Trump</a> when it <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trumps-1518747258-8f45b439-598b-43da-8456-0adaca44f00a.html\">thinks he deserves it</a>. But the overall effect has been muddy, which, for a tab like the <em>Post,</em> is a problem.</p>\n<p>To help think through how to cover Trump, Murdoch has brought one of his old lieutenants back into the fold. For the past three weeks, former <em>New York Post</em> editor-in-chief <strong>Col Allan</strong> has been drawing a paycheck as a consultant for News Corp., the newspaper-focused arm of the Murdoch media empire. âDonât mind me,â he quipped in his Australian brogue on his first day back at 1211 Avenue of the Americas, as the bespectacled Allan sunk his portly frame into an office chair beside current <em>Post</em> editor <strong>Stephen Lynch</strong> during the daily news meeting. For the rest of the week, according to <em>Post</em> sources, Allan worked out of a 10th-floor conference room next to the <em>Post</em>âs business desk, where he could be seen poring over newspapers, with his TV tuned to Fox News or the Golf Channel. Last week, Allan traveled to the companyâs London Bridge offices next to mega-tower the Shard for a swing through News UK, which includes <em>The Sun</em> and <em>The Times</em> of London. This week, Allan has been back in New York, where he piped up briefly during a news meeting when the discussion turned to the <em>Post</em>âs coverage of the <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong>-A.M.I. imbroglio, one of my sources told me. The rank and file doesnât seem to know exactly what heâs doing, but thereâs immense curiosity&#8212;and a dash of fear. Newer <em>Post</em> staffers who never got a taste of Allanâs jocular-meets-tyrannical management style quickly started Googling old news stories about him. âThereâs more of a chill with his return,â another insider said. âNobody knows what it all means.â</p>\n<p>Allan is a documented Trump supporter who was <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/ny-post-editor-allan-wears-trump-hat-newsroom-article-1.2572467\">photographed</a> in a MAGA baseball cap during the 2016 campaigns, which led many to believe that Murdoch must have brought him back to âFoxifyâ the Post, to borrow a term used by two sources close to the paper.</p>\n<p>The situation seems to be a bit more nuanced than that. In conversations heâs had with people at the <em>Post,</em> one insider told me, Allan has talked about how the tabloid needs to carve out its position on Trump, while also acknowledging that it has a large audience in deep blue New York City. âOn the one hand,â this person said, âheâs a Trumper. But on the other hand, he understands that, look, if youâre talking to a New York audience, you canât go full MAGA. You have to be strategic about how you do this. You canât just be all Fox News.â Representatives for News Corp., the <em>Post,</em> and Murdoch didnât comment.</p>\n<p>There was a time, not even all that long ago, when the top brass of New Yorkâs tabloids were seen as being as consequential and worthy of scrutiny as any of the cityâs big shots. That was especially true of Allan, the fearsome, pugilistic, bibulous Aussie newspaper legend who ran the <em>Post</em>âs newsroom for 15 years starting in 2001. For much of that time, Allan loomed large in the New York media fishbowl, whether it was a <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/page-sex-article-1.239026\">drunken lap-dancing debacle</a> with a future Australian prime minister; a <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/18/new-york-post-marathon_n_3110673.html\">wildly controversial tabloid wood</a>; or an <a href=\"https://gawker.com/5709288/new-york-post-political-editor-quits-after-fight-with-tyrant-boss\">expletive-laden blowup with one of his editors</a>. âIâll get fired not because Rupert doesnât like the stories I put in the paper. Iâll get fired because we donât sell newspapers,â Allan told <strong>Lloyd Grove</strong> in a memorable 2007 <em>New York</em> magazine <a href=\"https://nymag.com/news/media/37257/index4.html\">profile</a>. âAnd that judgment is made not by Rupert, but by the market, and by the audience. And I think thatâs pretty democratic. I like that deal.â</p>\n<p>By the time Allan did, in fact, leave the <em>Post,</em> in 2016, the tabloids were no longer the towering institutions they once were, and Allanâs retirement at the age of 62, though it generated some news coverage, was hardly an earth-shattering event. Allanâs handpicked successor, Lynch, assumed the top masthead role, while <strong>Jesse Angelo,</strong> a former Allan deputy and fellow longtime Murdoch consigliere whoâd become the <em>Post</em>âs publisher and C.E.O., forged ahead with his ambitious digital turnaround strategy to help stem the publicationâs famously prodigious losses. For the most part, the status quo carried on, business as usual.</p>\n<p>That all changed on January 17, with the abrupt and surprising announcement that Angelo was leaving the <em>Post</em> and News Corp. after 20 years. Angelo, it turned out, had learned about News Corp.âs decision to appoint a digital editor-in-chief for the <em>Post,</em> and also that the company was going to bring Allan back in an advisory role. As people familiar with Angeloâs thinking <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jesse-angelo-abruptly-exits-the-new-york-post-murdoch\">told me</a> at the time, he wasnât on board, and he exited the company amid concerns regarding the direction in which he believed the <em>Post</em> was heading both digitally and politically. (Angeloâs main digital deputies, <strong>Remy Stern</strong> and <strong>Neil Nagraj,</strong> have also departed.) Newsroom managers have since communicated to staff that Murdoch wants to ditch the type of catchall generic viral content that helped significantly juice nypost.comâs Web traffic, and to refocus more on stories that are âon brandâ with the <em>Post,</em> as someone familiar with the conversations put it.</p>\n<p>Allan, for his part, is apparently no longer the baddest beast in the tabloid jungle. Heâs been âfriendly and nice,â one of my sources said. âHeâs not the boss anymore, so he doesnât need to be scary.â</p>","rubric":"Media","socialTitle":"Col Allan Is Back to Help Figure Out the Postâs Trump Coverage","socialDescription":"Can Col Allan, the swashbuckling and bibulous tabloid star of the aughts, help the New York Post decode its most important reader?

But his surprise departure from the <em>Post</em> suggests fears over the return of an old battle-axe editor with Trumpian tendencies.","body":"<p>On Thursday evening, <strong>Rupert Murdochâs</strong> News Corp issued a surprising press release announcing that mustachioed <em>New York Post</em> boss <strong>Jesse Angelo</strong> would be âdeparting the company.â He is to be replaced as publisher and C.E.O. of the <em>Post</em> by Chief Revenue Officer <strong>Sean Giancola,</strong> according to the announcement, which also revealed the elevation of managing editor <strong>Michelle Gotthelf</strong> to the new position of digital editor in chief. The days when tabloid personnel shifts were seen as big news are long gone, but Angelo is a different story&#8212;the type that merits, say, a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/336e0c04-1aa3-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21\">write-up in the <em>Financial Times</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p>Angelo, after all, is a media darling of a bygone age. He was <strong>James Murdochâs</strong> kindergarten bestie, and later, his best man&#8212;a veritable fifth (and then seventh) Murdoch kid, who worked his way up the ladder at various enterprises within the family business. He did a U.K. tour at <em>The Sun</em> during a year off from Harvard, and after graduation, he landed at Australiaâs <em>Daily Telegraph.</em> Angelo joined the <em>Post</em> in 1999 and swiftly ascended the ranks, becoming the paperâs top business executive in 2012, and ushering in an era of digital growth for the famously money-losing News Corp tabloid. In 2011, when News Corp launched an ambitious but short-lived iPad publication called The Daily, Rupert chose Angelo as its editor in chief. In 2017, when Roger Ailes was ousted from Fox News, Angeloâs name briefly surfaced as a possible contender to run the network. That same year, he was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/media/tipsheets/morning-media/2017/03/sxsw-kicks-off-with-media-politics-bigs-on-taph-h-make-game-change-trilogy-officialjesse-angelo-on-the-ups-at-news-corp-001232\">given an additional brief</a> overseeing a major digital-advertising initiative at News Corp, which owns newspapers all over the world, leading to speculation that Angelo could very well end up running the whole company some day. Now, suddenly, he was out. âAfter 20 years at the <em>Post,</em> it is time for me to move on and let someone else write the next chapter,â Angelo said in the News Corp release. âI will always be thankful to Rupert.â</p>\n<p>Media watchers quickly assumed there was more between the lines, and it appears their instincts were correct. âThis went down very fast,â someone with direct knowledge of the situation told me. Other sources with direct knowledge of the situation told me that Angelo learned in recent days not only of Gotthelfâs expanded digital role, but also about talks to bring back former <em>Post</em> editor in chief <strong>Col Allan,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/04/new-york-post-editor-in-chief-col-allan-is-retiring-004480\">retired</a> in 2016 and was succeeded by <strong>Stephen Lynch,</strong> in an advisory capacity. These moves signaled change that Angelo wasnât driving, which created conflict, and he saw them as a diversion from the direction the <em>Post</em> had taken under his watch, according to sources familiar with his thinking.</p>\n<p>In Allanâs case, the talk of his return wasnât just a potential digital-strategy hindrance&#8212;it also looked like it could be an omen for editorial coverage. âCol coming back is like giving the keys to a Ferrari to a teenager,â said one source with knowledge of how it all went down, adding that if Allan does indeed come back as an adviser, âThe <em>Post</em> will certainly get more on the Trump bandwagon.â (Angelo didnât return text messages or a call. Reps for the <em>Post</em> and News Corp didnât have comments. Allan could not be reached.)</p>\n<p>Allan, a pit bull of a tabloid editor if there ever was one, was a mentor to Angelo. He was editor of the <em>Telegraph</em> back when Angelo was a cub reporter there; after Allan took the reins of the <em>Post</em> in 2001, Angelo became one of Allanâs top newsroom lieutenants. But they also clashed over strategy, as Allan resisted the Web-first gospel that Angelo and his digital team were preaching. Additionally, itâs worth noting that Allan is a documented Trump cheerleader&#8212;he was notably seen <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/ny-post-editor-allan-wears-trump-hat-newsroom-article-1.2572467\">sporting a MAGA baseball cap</a> in the <em>Post</em> newsroom during the 2016 campaigns.</p>\n<p>While the <em>Post</em> has always leaned right tonally under Murdoch&#8212;particularly in its fire-breathing opinion pages&#8212;Murdoch and Trump are known to speak regularly, and members of the newsroom, according to someone familiar with the dynamic, suspect that the <em>Post</em> might become more of a Trump mouthpiece as the 2020 election season heats up. The opinion programming at Murdochâs American cable-news powerhouse is already a veritable mouthpiece. But <em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> which Murdoch also owns, has broken a string of big stories that are problematic for Trump, and there have been instances where its conservative editorial pages were sharply critical of administration policy.</p>\n<p>Palace intrigue aside, the timing of Angeloâs departure coincides with another professional narrative. For the past few years, James Murdoch has been out of the loop at News Corp, which is run by Rupert and Jamesâs brother, <strong>Lachlan,</strong> and instead focused on his role as C.E.O. of sister company 21st Century Fox. And with 21CFâs sale to Disney entering the home stretch, James will soon be a free agent. As I <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/james-murdoch-post-fox-plans\">reported</a> in September, James has taken an office in downtown Manhattan, which is expected to serve as the command center for his post-Fox career, which a source told me will likely involve investing âin a handful of effortsâ in media, tech, and other areas. Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-16/james-murdoch-is-said-to-set-up-family-office-as-fortune-swells\">confirmed</a> the establishment of Murdochâs office earlier this week, reporting that it would have a staff of about 10 people.</p>\n<p>After Angeloâs News Corp departure was announced, multiple media insiders immediately speculated to me that he would join James in his new endeavor&#8212;a move that seems almost like a plot arc from <em>Succession.</em> But people who know both men told me thatâs not in the cards right now.

But is that enough to motivate Shari?","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>The saga of the Redstone family has in recent years become almost post-Shakespearean. For decades, the now 95-year-old <strong>Sumner Redstone</strong> ran his media empire like an omnipotent jefe unwilling to relinquish control. Occasionally, he was visionary. In 2006, when he thought that CBS no longer made sense under Viacomâs protective armor, he spun it out as its own publicly traded company, to be run by programming impresario <strong>Les Moonves,</strong> unlocking billions in new value for investors. Other times, his touch appeared to have atrophied. After Viacom lost out on MySpace, the once-seemingly canât-miss social-media platform, Redstone fired <strong>Tom Freston,</strong> the innovator behind MTV, and replaced him with his protÃ©gÃ© and attorney, <strong>Philippe Dauman.</strong> By 2016, as Viacomâs portfolio of networks dwindled, Redstone moved again. During an examination by the geriatric psychiatrist <strong>Dr. James Spar,</strong> Redstone said that his old lackey was doing a âbad job.â (<em>Les Fagen,</em>_ Daumanâs attorney, argued that Redstoneâs remarks were the product of âmanipulation.â) In a contemporaneous statement, Spar said that Redstone made clear âhe makes all the decisions about Viacom and CBS.â</p>\n<p>Of course, that would soon change, given the patriarchâs declining health and the rise of his once-estranged daughter, <strong>Shari Redstone,</strong> who inherited a very different media environment than the one her father had helped create. For one, his mighty empire was no longer indomitable. Viacomâs top brands, such as MTV and Comedy Central, had receded in the zeitgeist. CBS, while home to incredibly valuable assets such as Showtime and its eponymous television network, no longer appeared large enough to compete with the Silicon Valley streaming behemoths (Netflix, Amazon) and a new generation of Franken-legacy behemoths (AT&amp;Tâs WarnerMedia and Disney+). The media industry had become a game of sharks (and minnows)&#8212;an economic ecosystem that, to steal a line from <strong>Chase Carey,</strong> the former chairman of 21st Century Fox, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/rupert-murdoch-the-media-mogul-says-goodbye-to-much-of-the-company-he-built/2018/07/01/ab546216-7a23-11e8-aeee-4d04c8ac6158_story.html?utm_term=.10fa1abdebdd\">requires</a> either super-scale or uniquely qualitative assets. Shari needed the former. And so she twice embarked upon on a plan to recombine CBS and Viacom, the assets that her father split apart 13 years ago.</p>\n<p>At first, her chief obstacle was Moonves, who didnât want CBS burdened by what he apparently thought were a bunch of tired, market-share-losing cable channels. But Moonvesâs alleged sexual misconduct, reported late last year, eliminated him from the picture. (Moonves has denied wrongdoing.) By the end of last year, Shari appeared to have yet another free path to renew the merger discussions between CBS and Viacom.</p>\n<p>Even opponents have come to admire her tactics. She settled nettlesome lawsuits. She tamed <strong>Joe Ianniello,</strong> Moonvesâs former protÃ©gÃ©, who has been running CBS on an acting basis, and would presumably like to get the gig full-time. She also has had a long and productive relationship with Viacom C.E.O. <strong>Bob Bakish.</strong> And, as the chief representative of National Amusements, which owns nearly 80 percent of the voting stock of both companies, she has presided over the remaking of both companiesâ boards. Her only apparent remaining obstacle, agreed upon as part of Moonvesâs separation agreement from CBS, was a contractual stipulation that National Amusements would not initiate a merger between the two companies until after September 2020. But the boards, and their wise counsel, are no doubt taking comfort from the loophole theyâve found that allows for the conversations to happen because they were not initiated by National Amusements and Shari.</p>\n<p>Word of the latest renewed interest in a recombination between CBS and Viacom came via CNBC, in a piece <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/30/cbs-viacom-discovery-may-merge-for-survival.html\">published</a> January 31. The article also contained a new twist in the saga: Discovery Inc., home to 19 digital channels including the Food Network and OWN, <strong>Oprah Winfreyâs</strong> eponymous network, was also suddenly in the mix of strategic considerations for CBS, either before or after it tried to consummate a combination with Viacom. (Discovery, which denied it is interested in a sale, is partly owned by Advance, CondÃ© Nastâs parent company. Spokespeople from CBS, Viacom, and National Amusements declined to comment for this article.)</p>\n<p>Whatâs behind these various corporate machinations? A mega-merger could allow Shari to find some form of tax-free liquidity for National Amusements and its roughly $5 billion stakes in CBS and Viacom, while also enhancing her chances of becoming a bigger and more powerful media mogul. She knows the CBS television network and Showtime, its premium pay network, are valuable assets in the ongoing media-merger chess matches, and she seems more determined than ever to get as much value as she can for her family, presumably in as tax-efficient a way as possible.</p>\n<p>But unlike a CBS combination with Viacom, a CBS combination with Discovery actually makes sense for CBS shareholders and for CBS. Itâs a conclusion I come by honestly as a onetime Wall Street M&amp;A banker focused on the media and telecom industries. (Donât @ me.) There are a number of reasons why the combination makes sense, and I&#39;ve laid them out here.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>First, there is a nice demographic fit between the two companies, both of which have sizable viewership in the desirable 18&#8211;54 age group, while four of Discoveryâs channels&#8212;HGTV, TLC, Discovery, and Investigation Discovery&#8212;are among the top 20 channels watched on television, according to IndieWire. There is also a nice geographic fit between the two companies: CBS and Showtime are largely domestic networks, while Discovery has a made a large, and reasonably successful, international push through a variety of channels now broadcasting overseas, as well as its ownership of a number of large European broadcast networks, and the rights to broadcast the Olympics in Europe. This could help a combined CBS-Discovery leapfrog over Comcast, which just paid a bundle for Sky, which is mostly a U.K. business.</p>\n<p>Discovery also has the rights to broadcast golf overseas, which would fit well with CBSâs domestic golf prowess. Together, Discovery and CBS could be a global sports juggernaut.The combined company would also have greater clout with advertisers and with the cable giants, where size is essential for channel placements on the dial and for re-transmission fees. Discovery could help Showtime with its streaming presence and it brings more than 8,000 hours of original programming&#8212;on topics such as food, science, and home, to say nothing of Oprah&#8212;to a streaming world.</p>\n<p>To be sure, there are plenty of deal-related obstacles. For instance, would CBS buy Discovery or would Discovery buy CBS, or could some form of merger of nearly equals be constructed? CBS has a market capitalization of around $30 billion, including about $9.5 billion of debt. Discoveryâs market capitalization is about $31 billion, more than half of which is debt. Figuring that out is not hard, and Wall Street investment bankers would salivate at the chance to create a $60 billion-plus media giant.</p>\n<p>One important question for Shari Redstone and the CBS board of directors: who to name as the C.E.O. of the combined company? On the one hand, it should be relatively easy. Discovery C.E.O. <strong>David Zaslav,</strong> who has had the job since 2007, has proven to be a world-class media executive, in the same league as Moonves was, once upon a time. (Their gargantuan pay packages were also similar, with Zaslav, a.k.a. âthe Zas,â racking up total pay of around $112 million in the past three years.) The market would probably dance a jig if Zaslav were named C.E.O. of the combined company.</p>\n<p>One would think Zaslav would be an obvious and welcome choice, given that CBS is currently engaged in a highly publicized C.E.O. search following Moonvesâs departure. (CBS has said the search will be completed by the end of the first quarter.) Alas, the situation is not that simple. (These things often are not.) Ianniello now has a legitimate claim to the job through savvy personnel moves such as naming <strong>Susan Zirinsky</strong> head of CBS News and <strong>Bill Owens</strong> head of <em>60 Minutes.</em> He also has been a calming force around CBS. But Ianniello was Moonvesâs loyal No. 2 and that could be an ongoing problem for Shari, despite his solid performance. She prizes fealty, and has long wanted Bakish to succeed Moonves once CBS and Viacom were combined. She may still want Bakish to lead CBS, and that alone could scotch a CBS merger with Discovery. Certainly Bakish would be much easier for Shari to control than Zaslav.</p>\n<p>Of course, if CBS and Discovery were to combine, there is the obvious matter of what becomes of Viacom in the aftermath. Thatâs not as dire for Viacom as it may seem at first blush. Bakish can continue improving the operations at the company and making bolt-on acquisitions, such as its <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/02/09/why-viacom-is-buying-pluto-tv.aspx\">interesting purchase</a> of Pluto TV for $340 million. Viacom will live to fight another day, either as part of a rejuvenated CBS-Discovery when the time is right or as part of another media behemoth.</p>\n<p>The bigger question for Shari comes down, once again, to whether she is willing to consider what is best for the non-Redstone CBS shareholders. The Redstones own around 10 percent of the economic interest in CBS (and only a tiny fraction of Viacomâs economic shares), but control what happens at both companies through their voting shares. In the past, Shari has appeared reluctant to take into account the concerns of CBSâs minority shareholders. But if on the off chance she is willing to do that this time, there would be rewards aplenty for all CBS shareholders in a combined CBS-Discovery with Zaslav at the helm.

Can she shed her Trump baggage? âPeople donât stay in Hollywood jail forever,â says one entertainment executive.","body":"<p>In early October, shortly after the newly spun-off Fox media company\nannounced her appointment as chief communications officer, Hope Hicks\nflew to Los Angeles and set up shop at the Century City InterContinental\nto meet with her new counterparts, the Hollywood trade press. During her\nyears flacking for Donald Trump, Hicks had developed a reputation among\npolitical reporters as a fair broker of sorts. Her stoic disposition may\nhave belied an assassin-level fealty to her boss, but she was\nnevertheless polite and competent in a milieu otherwise defined by chaos\nand turbulence. Perhaps more importantly, she had juice.</p>\n<p>Over the years, Hicks had become an ever present Trump appendage, a\nsurrogate daughter, de facto whisperer and translator. She was a\nZelig-like character in the White House telenovela&#8212;a witness in the\nMueller probe, a young woman who admitted to Congress that she had told\nâwhite liesâ on behalf of her boss. She was allegedly party to a\ncampaign relationship, a West Wing fling, Cabinet tribalism, and\nremained, indisputably, one of the most influential voices in the\npresidentâs ear. She touched everything but had fingerprints on nothing.\nEveryone and no one knew her. E-mails and phone calls typically began\nwith âOff the record.â She was the elusive person familiar with the\nsituation. And she was familiar with just about every situation.</p>\n<p>More than anything, though, Hicks was an enigma. Not yet 30 years old,\nwas she a neophyte or a calculating and ambitious striver who advanced\nher way up the greasy pole by blithely defending Trumpâs\nbehavior&#8212;someone who had willingly stood by him during the Billy Bush\ntape, the Muslim ban, and âLock her upâ? Was she attracted to power,\nor simply quite skilled at managing the most powerful person in the\nroom&#8212;at interpreting his whims for everyone else bewildered by the\nbehavior? Was she in that role because, given her obvious beauty, she\nappeared perfectly âcastâ for it, in her bossâs parlance? (According\nto Michael Wolffâs <em>Fire and Fury,</em> Trump referred to Hicks as âthe best\npiece of tailâ that his former aide Corey Lewandowski, the partner in\nthat alleged campaign tryst with Hicks, would âever have.â) Or was it\nall sexist bullshit, and was she merely the only competent one in this\nviperâs den of a West Wing?</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed/?pub=vf&amp;articleID=hope-and-change\"><iframe height=\"100\" width=\"350\" src=\"https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed/?pub=vf&amp;articleID=hope-and-change\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>Everyone had a take, it seemed, but no one knew. Hicks, after all, was\nvirtually unknowable. Keeping her bossâs hours, she woke up at four\noâclock in the morning to answer e-mail and exercise. She could run only\ninside, on a treadmill, because she needed to have her two phones in\nfront of her. (Most of her workouts, according to a person familiar with\nthe routine, consisted of running as fast as she could for three minutes\nat a time before the next call came in.) She arrived at the White House\nat 7:30 for a meeting with whoever was chief of staff, and then spent\nvirtually the entire day within earshot of the president. She declined\nto participate in interviews and turned down offers to pose for\nlegendary photographers.</p>\n<p>Among Hollywood reporters, few knew what to expect when Hicks arrived in\nLos Angeles. Many, naturally, had opinions. âAll bets were already\nagainst her, because there was an innate disrespect and dislike for the\nwork she did for Trump,â one Hollywood media executive told me,\nreferring to Hicksâs reported role in crafting the presidentâs infamous\nresponses to Donald Trump Jr.âs meeting with a Russian lawyer in 2016\nand his foreknowledge of the Stormy Daniels payoff, among other things.\nâSheâs the person who lied for him and worked for him, and seemed to\nhave no problem with it, and could sleep at night.â</p>\n<p>But given that newsrooms are really just like high-school cafeterias,\nmany had tapped colleagues in Washington and New York for useful gossip.\nA handful of reporters who met Hicks for coffee told me that they were\ninstructed to anticipate someone kind and hardworking. In these\nconversations, Hicks was clear that the job marked a new start for her.\nShe also told the reporters that they should not assume anything about\nher beliefs based on comments espoused by her previous âprincipalâ&#8212;a\nreference to Trump.</p>\n<p>After these conversations, according to numerous people who met with\nher, Hicks seemed saccharine yet somehow sincere. She was also unlike\nany publicist they had ever seen. In Hollywood, beauty is defined by the\nsort of effortless, invisible cool made possible only by a great deal of\neffort and a whole lot of money. Hicks, a former Ralph Lauren model and\na student of the Trump aesthetic, often arrived in black sunglasses,\nblown-out chestnut hair, and a full face of makeup. âIt was four P.M.\nwhen I met her, and it was like an alien landed in the middle of Los\nAngeles,â one reporter told me. âThatâs not the L.A. vibe. That\ndoesnât play out here.â</p>\n<p>A few weeks into her job, Hicks found herself in a little hot water.\nSeveral reporters had gotten a tip that longtime Fox executive Gary\nNewman was being relieved of his duties after tense contract\nnegotiations. Newman had wanted a shorter-term deal that would extend\nonly through the Murdoch familyâs sale of 21st Century Fox to Disney&#8212;a\n$70-billion-plus mega-merger whose remaining unsold assets, such as Fox\nNews and Fox Sports, would constitute the new Fox entity for which Hicks\nworked. But Fox wanted Newman to sign on to a longer deal. Several\nreporters asked Hicks about Newman, and she insisted that the rumors\nwere untrue and she would let them know if something were to change.\nThings moved faster than she anticipated, though, and on October 19, Fox\ndistributed a press release saying that Newman was out and Charlie\nCollier, an AMC executive, would become head of entertainment for Foxâs\nbroadcasting division.</p>\n<p>In Washington, Hicks may have been able to pull out an excuse for\nreporters&#8212;the situation was fluid, her principal had changed his mind,\net cetera. But in the world of entertainment reporting&#8212;where\njournalists churn less frequently, develop their own soft power, and\nwork on a timeworn barter system&#8212;some felt as if Hicks may have\ncommitted a legitimate foul. âThe journalist-publicist relationship in\nthis town is all about the trust in the exchange of information,â the\nreporter explained. âIâll sit on a story about A-B-C in the short term\nin exchange for X-Y-Z down the line. Itâs all about the long-term gain,\nand I donât think that she got that.â</p>\n<p>Other reporters moved on. It was a fairly minor issue, they told me,\nthat was probably blown out of proportion because most people didnât\nwant to like her. But the media executive made clear: âYou do not lie.\nNot here. You will be run out of town.â</p>\n<p><strong>In some ways,</strong> Hicks has always been better suited for Hollywood than for\nWashington. Raised comfortably in Greenwich, Connecticut, her parents\nmet while working as aides on Capitol Hill. Her father eventually went\non to flack for a tobacco company and, later, for the National Football\nLeague. (Her grandfather handled the P.R. for Texaco during the 1970s\noil crisis.) In sixth grade, at a neighborâs suggestion, Hicks and her\nsister, Mary Grace, auditioned for a Ralph Lauren campaign and were\nbooked. She posed for Bruce Weber in a campaign for Naturalizer shoes\nand appeared in an episode of <em>Guiding Light</em> and a Nickelodeon program\nabout golf. She auditioned for a part in a movie alongside Alec Baldwin.\nAt 13, she posed for a cover story in <em>Greenwich Magazine,</em> explaining\nthat âif the acting thing doesnât work out, I could really see myself\nin politics.â</p>\n<p>Around that time, she filmed an audition tape for a kidâs edition of the\nhit show <em>Weakest Link.</em> (On the tape, she performed an improvised rap,\nand offered her best James Bond imitation.) The tape impressed\nexecutives enough that the studio flew her and her mother out to L.A.\nfor a final audition. They spent the days leading up to the meeting\nbeing very âL.A.â&#8212;visiting the store Julia Roberts got kicked out of\nin <em>Pretty Woman,</em> and shopping on Rodeo. Once she arrived at the\naudition, however, reality set in. She did some quick math: there were\neight podiums on set and 10 kids in the room. âYou still have to\naudition,â her mom told her, explaining that not everyone at the studio\nwould get selected for the show.</p>\n<p>Hicks, now known for her sangfroid, panicked; she blew the performance.\nIt became somewhat of a running Hicks-household joke for years. Before\nevery job interview or tryouts for sports teams or auditions, her mom\nwould playfully remind her to not â<em>Weakest Link</em>â when it came time.\nHicks never wanted to feel that way again; it gave her a Trump-like\ndrive to win whenever she was reminded of it.</p>\n<p>At Greenwich High School, she lettered in swimming and, like her father\nand sister before her, went on to become captain of the lacrosse team,\nwhich she led to a state championship. To celebrate her graduation, her\nfamily took out a full page in her yearbook with family photos and\nmodeling shots of her and Mary Grace collaged together and the lyrics to\nthe Lovinâ Spoonfulâs âDo You Believe in Magicâ typed in little black\nletters. âHope Charlotte Hicks,â it reads at the top. âTo the girl\nwith magic in her heart.â</p>\n<div class=\"callout large\" data-type=\"callout\"><p>âShe got about as <em>elegant of an exit</em> as anyone could possibly get,â\nsays one Hicks confidant.</p>\n</div><p>Hicks majored in English literature and started the lacrosse team at\nSouthern Methodist University, in Dallas, but stumbled into a circuitous\npath that would lead her to the White House when she joined her father\nat a tailgate event for Super Bowl XLV, in February 2011, in nearby\nArlington. There she met Matthew Hiltzik, a New York public-relations\nexecutive who had worked with Hillary Clinton and Harvey Weinstein at\nMiramax, among others, and whose firm represented Alec Baldwin at the time.\nHiltzik Strategies also managed Ivankaâs burgeoning clothing brand.\nHiltzik would eventually hire Hicks, who was subsequently enlisted to work on\nthe Ivanka account. The two quickly developed a rapport, and Hicks was hired\nat the Trump Organization to handle public relations.</p>\n<p>When Donald Trump announced that he was running for president, Hicks was\n26 and commuting into Manhattan from an apartment she rented with her\nsister in Greenwich. During the campaign, she spent almost a year and a\nhalf living between Trump Force One, as the candidate referred to his\nprivate jet, and a Trump-owned condominium. From the time she woke up,\nat about four oâclock in the morning, until the time she went to bed,\nwhich could be after midnight, her phone vibrated with incoming calls\nand e-mails from reporters, and she answered almost all of\nthem&#8212;because she was the communications staff. After the election, her\nascent to the Trump administration was a certainty. âSheâs one of the\npeople who was most candid and most honest with the president, whose\nadvice he valued tremendously,â Ivanka Trump told me. âItâs because\nshe doesnât opine on issues she hasnât studied. Any of the roles sheâs\nstepped into over the last decade, people would try to argue that she\ndidnât have qualifications for this or that. But she did so anyway\nbecause she knew her level of intelligence, confidence, work ethic, and\nconviction and ability to jump in. You could literally assign her\nanything and she would be successful.â</p>\n<p>Sure, it was unusual that Hicks had no political experience, but neither\ndid the president and many of his top aides, including his daughter and\nson-in-law, Jared Kushner. Reporters seemed to like her and, eventually,\ngrew to respect her. They also knew that she was umbilically connected\nto her principal. Not only did she sit right outside the presidentâs\noffice, but she was also in touch with him constantly during the few\nhours they were apart. Often, she would be on the phone with Trump as\nshe hurried through the White House security checkpoint early in the\nmorning. According to someone familiar with the situation, Hicks would\nask the Secret Service agents if she could go through the metal\ndetectors with her cell phone. They didnât much care who was on the\nline; she would need to follow protocol. âHang on,â she would tell the\npresident, according to this person. âIâm putting you through the\nconveyor belt.â Then sheâd pick right back up talking as she entered\nthe building, where she would see him a few minutes later.</p>\n<p>Over time, however, the schedule and scrutiny, the mix of heightened\nprofessional responsibility and lack of control over her personal life,\nstarted to weigh heavily on Hicks. Close as she and Trump had become, he\ncould blow up her day with a pre-dawn tweet. Hicks also faces the\nprospect of legal bills stemming from the various federal investigations\ninto the campaign. Her entire life played out within a short radius\naround the White House. Hicks considered leaving, and she labored over\nthe rollout of her departure. For a time, Ivanka and Kushner persuaded\nher to stick it out. According to people familiar with her thinking, she\nalso didnât want to create the impression that one particular news event\nhad hastened her exit. But her departure was unfurled soon after the\npaparazzi discovered that she was dating White House staff secretary Rob\nPorter.</p>\n<p>In late January 2018, Hicks and Porter joined other members of the White\nHouse communications team, including Hogan Gidley and Josh Raffel, who\nhad become Hicksâs closest friend stemming from their time together at\nHiltzik, at Gidleyâs apartment. After a subsequent group dinner at Rosa\nMexicano, a photographer with a long lens caught Hicks and Porter\nkissing in the backseat of a taxi on their way home together. EXCLUSIVE:\nWHITE HOUSE ROMANCE! read the <em>Daily Mail</em> headline on the first day of\nFebruary. The plot quickly grew darker after the tabloid published\ninterviews with Porterâs two ex-wives, who claimed that he had\nphysically and verbally abused them. (At the time, Porter called many of\nthe allegations âslanderous and simply false.â)</p>\n<p>âItâs grating on anyone when you come with a group to my apartment and\nthere are pictures of you downstairs when you get in a cab, and there\nare pictures of you when you are in that cab. Itâs so much more creepy\nand invasive when the paparazzi is strategically hidden with a telephoto\nzoom lens taking photos from afar&#8212;and thatâs what they did to Hope\nevery single day,â Gidley said. âShe chose to make her role a\nbehind-the-scenes one and not be an out-front spokesperson ...\nbecause she wanted a level of anonymity. At a human level, she just\nwanted to work hard and live her life without some picture being taken\non every street corner.â By the end of that month, <em>The New York Times</em>\nbroke the news that Hicks was leaving.</p>\n<p>Hicks cried when she told the communications team of her decision.\nGidley, himself emotional, teared up. âIâm ashamed to admit I was\nselfishly upset and upset for the administration, because she was so\nincredibly good at her job,â Gidley said, recalling Hicks laughing\nthrough tears when he told her he didnât like change. âI shouldâve been\nconsoling her, but she came over and hugged me.â Trump did not erupt\nwhen she told him the news; he had expected she would move on someday.\nHe gave her an uncharacteristically kind public send-off. âI consider\nit a skill to leave that White House with an elegant exit,â one person\nwho has advised Hicks professionally told me. âAnd she got about as\nelegant of an exit that anyone could possibly get.â On her last day,\nshe handed out notes to each staffer in her loopy, girlish penmanship.</p>\n<p><strong>After her departure,</strong> Hicks decamped to Greenwich to recuperate with her\nfamily. For a while, things had been tense in the Hicks house as her\nparents worried about her punishing hours, physical safety, and mounting\nnegative publicity. Initially, it wasnât easy to transition from the\nfast-twitch, Trump-staffer lifestyle. âYouâre used to your phone\nringing every 10 seconds,â a former White House colleague told me,\nexplaining the phenomenon, âand you start to take your phone out of\nyour pocket to check your e-mail, and you say to yourself, Oh, I didnât\nget an e-mail. And then you check 10 seconds later and, again, you say,\nOh, I didnât get an e-mail.â She made time for old friends, ran outside\nwithout fear of having both phones in front of her, took some weekend\ntrips out of town.</p>\n<p>Hicks didnât totally disengage. She monitored the news and kept in touch\nwith Trump, Ivanka, and the White House communications team about\nstories and messaging. She accompanied staffers on a trip aboard Air\nForce One to central Ohio, prompting rumors that she might re-enter the\nWhite House. She was even floated as an outside contender for the\nchief-of-staff position amid the enduring John Kelly drama.</p>\n<p>Speculation was fueled, in part, because the private sector had not been\nkind to Trump alums. Reince Priebus had returned to his former law firm;\nSean Spicer had barely caught on as a Fox News commentator. Rex\nTillerson and Gary Cohn had yet to chart their new courses. Raffel would\nland on his feet at the controversial e-cigarette manufacturer Juul, and\nDina Powell settled back into a larger role at Goldman Sachs than the\none she left before she joined the administration. Hicks solicited\nadvice from Ivanka and Kushner, Powell, Cohn, and Hiltzik, who all\nencouraged her to take meetings. And she did&#8212;sometimes one at\nbreakfast, another at lunch, and then for post-work drinks or for\ndinner. There were opportunities flacking for private-equity firms and\nrepresenting wealthy finance guys. She constantly fielded the suggestion\nthat she go on television. She was attractive and articulate and no one\nknew the administration better, the suggestions went. But Hicks is\nconflict-averse by nature, and the idea of slugging it out on cable news\ndid not appeal to her. Sure, she had opinions and a story to tell, but\nnow did not feel like the right time to use her voice. She considered\nmemorializing her thoughts on paper, perhaps for a book. Nothing has\nbeen formalized yet.</p>\n<p>One adviser told me that Hicks had initial trepidation about whether she\nhad been tarnished by the Trump brand. But Hicks also realized that her\nability to work with Trump made her valuable to a narrow, but lucrative,\nmarket. âShe was very deliberate in figuring out what would be right,â\nIvanka told me.</p>\n<p>Months after her departure, she had lunch with a high-profile host of a\npopular Fox News program who had become a friend. He, like many others,\nsuggested that she take a job in TV. When she demurred, he told her she\nshould meet some people at the network anyway. They walked over to the\nFox headquarters on Sixth Avenue, where she met with a few people, who\nfollowed up a couple of weeks later saying that, it so happened, Lachlan\nMurdoch was looking for someone to run communications for New Fox, the\ncompany he was starting once the assets were spun off in the Disney\nsale. The two had lunch at the Sixth Avenue headquarters.</p>\n<p>A person familiar with the hiring process told me that they called White\nHouse reporters, inquiring about what she was like to work with and\nwhether she was strategic. âWith me, she had to overcome her\nrelationship with Trump, which was a straight down, not an up,â this\nperson explained. âI wondered if everyone who worked for him was out of\ntheir minds, but all of the reporters I called, from papers that were\npretty tough on the administration, all said she was smart, responsive,\nand had integrity.â</p>\n<p>Around the same time, Trump had a scheduled chat with Rupert Murdoch,\nand he mentioned that Hicks was interviewing for the job and, of course,\nrecommended her. Hicks flew to L.A. for a final round of meetings and\ninterviews. As she had for the audition nearly two decades earlier, her\nmom tagged along for fun, and joked with her not to â<em>Weakest Link</em>â it.\nBy the end of the trip, New Fox offered her the job of communications\ndirector. She thought about it for a few days before she accepted.</p>\n<p>In some ways, New Fox was an easy, familiar choice. It was run by a\nwealthy, occasionally dysfunctional family and traded in a familiar form\nof loudmouth conservatism. âItâs a little bit of Trump-lite,â one\nperson close to her told me. âYou can still be a little drunk on the\nKool-Aid.â</p>\n<p>It also seemed oddly manageable given her experience. Hicksâs chief\ntalent is being someoneâs barely visible hand. Lachlan Murdoch, who\nwould be her new principal, is not Donald Trump, and New Fox is not the\nTrump Organization or the White House.</p>\n<p>But, in another regard, it was going to be a challenge. In the White\nHouse, technically she answered to the American public, but her job in\nthe West Wing was always about serving her audience of one. Running\ncommunications for a public company, where you answer to shareholders\nand are constantly held accountable by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and no-fucks-to-give veteran reporters, is a\ntruth-elasticity-free zone. White lies are possibly fireable offenses.</p>\n<p>But the job offered one undeniable advantage. It was in a place where\nlong-lens photographers would stake out other, far more famous young\nwomen, outside the psychic mindlock of the Acela corridor. Hicks was\nhesitant to move so far from her family. But her relationship with\nPorter had ended months before; she had no long-term lease on an\napartment. She decided to follow her new principal. âI donât think she\nwas looking one way or another to move or not to move,â one longtime\nclose friend explained. âBut it was an opportunity. It was a fresh\nstart.â She joked with friends that her parents wanted her to have a\nhealthy relationship, so she decided to move to L.A.</p>\n<p><strong>The sun still</strong> had not fully broken through the late-fall darkness when a\ntwentysomething woman in a neon sports bra and black Lululemons cranked\nup an old Chris Brown remix and pulled down a set of multi-colored\nresistance bands suspended from the ceiling. The boutique fitness\nstudio, heated to well over 90 degrees, was filled with a half-dozen\nyoung women who were there to bounce about the springy, wide-paneled\nwood floor, pull down those bands with their lithe, twiggy arms, and\nlift their ankles strapped with 1.5-pound weights about a million times\nin a row while the remixes blasted. On any given morning, Gwyneth\nPaltrow or Jennifer Lopez or Tracee Ellis Ross could have been there.</p>\n<p>That morning, though, there were no <em>celebrity</em> celebrities. There was one\nwoman in the back row, though, in a navy moisture-wicking turtleneck and\na headband, as if she were dressed for a brisk winter run at Deerfield.\nTo be fair, it is unlikely that anyone would have expected to see Hicks\nin a dance cardio class fit for Hollywood starlets at six oâclock in the\nmorning. That is the beauty of Hollywood for Hicks. No one\nbatted an eye when she went to dinner at Spago at the end of the year,\nbecause Oprah was at a table behind her. (Her mom pleaded with her to go\nup to the mega-star. âGo tell her youâll run her 2020 campaign!â she\nteased. Hicks did not, but she did take a not-so-great photo of her on\nher cell phone.) No one paid attention to her when she attended a Drake\nconcert, or spent an afternoon at Universal Studios. When she walked\ninto the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel for coffee one November\nmorning&#8212;reveling in the plaids of her Greenwich youth&#8212;no one in the\nplace looked her way. Hicks didnât check her phone during the entirety\nof the class, which ended near midday on the East Coast. There was no\nfear of a missed call or tweet, a new fresh hell.</p>\n<p>Hicks still wakes up at four A.M., though more out of habit than\nnecessity. She has not once turned on the television in her apartment,\naccording to someone familiar with her new routine, and opted against\ninstalling one in her office. She reads the paper in print leisurely in\nthe morning, and listens to audiobooks at home and on her commute to\nwork. Once she gets to the office, around nine A.M., she, like her\nformer boss, will make notes on paper copies of stories and send them,\nsnail mail, to her family, or to people in the administration who might\nget ideas about speeches or policy positions. She tells her assistant to\nkeep the first hour of her day free, her own executive time.</p>\n<p>Most days, she is home by six P.M., and is content to keep to herself,\nat least for now. She never mingled much with the Washington set or\nreporters in a social way when she was on the campaign or in the White\nHouse, and so far her life in Los Angeles seems to be much the same.\nâSheâs focused on setting up a good life, and she is all-in on work,â\none longtime friend told me. âHope is not someone who needs a lot of\nacquaintances and 10 girlfriends. She values quality over quantity, and\nshe invests in people who she is really close with.â She still texts\nwith Ivanka and Gidley and sees Raffel when he visits Los Angeles. The\npresident still calls her, too.</p>\n<p>There are many questions about what will happen to New Fox, which is\ncompeting in a universe against far larger media behemoths as consumers\ncontinue to cut the cord and pivot to streaming services. Fox News still\nthrows off more than a billion in profit, but its audience is well\nbeyond retirement age, and the companyâs other core properties (its\nsports networks and Fox Business) may not provide a bulletproof hedge\nagainst the digital future. Media observers wonder whether Rupert\nMurdoch, who has traditionally led with his gut, has erred in entrusting\nso much responsibility to a 30-year-old with no experience at a public\ncompany and major Trump baggage&#8212;not to mention whatever potential\nlegal entanglements she might face down the line. Meanwhile, Hicks has\ndone little to offer clues to political junkies. Was she a\nco-conspirator in Trumpworld, or someone just along for the ride? A\ncunning political operator, or an indifferent player with highly attuned\nGreenwich-style social skills? Younger than the vast majority of her\nformer colleagues, will she forever be remembered for something she did\nin her 20s? The Murdochs, for their part, have told people theyâre\nimpressed with her work so far, according to those who have spoken with\nthem about Hicks.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the greatest indication that Hicks is, in fact, highly skilled\nat this kind of work is the way in which she has managed her own P.R. In\na campaign and White House where nearly every person became the story at\nsome point, Hicks was able to largely stay out of sight. Sheâd be lucky\nto maintain this quality in her new life, as she starts the rest of it\nfresh. Indeed, where better to test that out than in L.A.&#8212;a city based\non re-invention? âThis is where people come to re-write themselves,â\nthe Hollywood executive told me. âIf, at the end of the year, if she\nlasts that long, and sheâs at a party, I canât see people not\ngravitating towards her. She has a big job. People donât stay in\nHollywood jail forever, not if youâre that pretty.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The family drama surrounding <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/biden-2020-front-runner-family-divorce-drama?inline\">Joe Bidenâs presidential bid</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; What to make of the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/buzzfeed-mueller-saga-veteran-journalists-circumspect-confused?inline\">BuzzFeed-Mueller mystery</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; A happy ending for one <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/fyre-festival-caterer-gofundme-maryann-rolle?inline\">Fyre Festival contractor</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Intrigue in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jesse-angelo-abruptly-exits-the-new-york-post-murdoch?inline\">Murdoch-land</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Yes, <em>Schittâs Creek</em> really is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/yes-schitts-creek-really-is-that-good?inline\">that good</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"From The Magazine","socialTitle":"Hope Hicks, West Wing Alum, Begins Her Second Act on the West Coast","socialDescription":"After years in the Trump orbit, Hicks has entered a brave new world of Murdochs, fussy trade reporters, and Los Angeles semiotics.

Though she lost her election in November, thanks in part to alleged <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/lawsuit-challenges-000-stalled-georgia-voter-registrations/PK3tylRO9Z1ICNzDcH0FyH/\">voter suppression</a>, Abrams, a black woman, came within 1.4 percentage points of beating her Republican rival in a state that <strong>Donald Trump</strong> won by 5.1 points. In the weeks since, Abrams hasnât faded from the headlines: she is reportedly being <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/24/stacey-abrams-georgia-senate-2020-1121843\">courted by the D.N.C.</a> to run for the Senate in 2020, and has also spoken publicly about taking another shot at the governorâs mansion in 2022.</p>\n<p>Still, delivering the rebuttal can pour gasoline on a career in the bad way, too. The post-State of the Union speech&#8212;a tradition that began in 1966 when Gerald Ford went on television to rip into Lyndon Johnson&#8212;has a reputation humbling politicians on the rise. More often than not, the opposition partyâs sacrificial lamb struggles to adapt to the awkward format, staring into a camera in an obviously staged setting, unable to match the operatic grandeur of the House chamber. There is no applause, no pageantry, no live audience, and&#8212;in the infamous case of <strong>Marco Rubio</strong>&#8212;nothing to distract from the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVlmZE3WcmI\">excruciating sound of dry mouth</a>. âIf anybody can actually deliver a good State of the Union response, which most scientists believe is not physically possible under conventional interpretations of physics,â <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1090342676698943488\">quipped</a> FiveThirtyEightâs <strong>Nate

He is also scheduled to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee next month. Monico, according to a source who knows him, is a sensible choice to hold his hand through those final stages.</p>\n<p>âIt is really not that challenging to handle cooperating your client,â said the source, a Chicago-based attorney who has faced Monico in court. âOnce youâve got the deal, it more or less can be a fairly straightforward exercise. This is not the sort of thing that is going to require him to roll up his sleeves and dig into the docs and try to find a way to defend the case in court.â Although this person suggested Monicoâs âbest days are behind him,â he also described Cohenâs new representation as well-respected in the Chicago area, and well-equipped to guide him through conversations with Mueller. âIt is more like babysitting and dealing with his questions and giving him personal advice.â</p>\n<p>Cohenâs shifting representation has often foreshadowed new legal strategies. Shortly after his office was raided in April, Cohen hired a team from McDermott, Will &amp; Emery to sift through the 3.7 million documents seized by the F.B.I. Later, when he began cooperating more closely with New York prosecutors, he parted ways with lead attorney <strong>Stephen Ryan</strong> and <strong>Todd Harrison,</strong> a fellow partner at the firm, and hired Southern District vets Petrillo and Lester to help guide him through the process.</p>\n<p>All those lawyers didnât come cheap. Cohenâs legal bills ultimately climbed into the seven figures, as my colleague <strong>Emily Jane Fox</strong> previously <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/michael-cohen-manhattan-court-sentencing\">reported</a>. Now, with his sentencing behind him, it appears Cohen is doing some rightsizing. Itâs presumably a good deal for Monico and Spevack, too. âI think a lot of attorneys would have given a deal to Cohen in order to have the case and bring attention to yourself,â the Chicago lawyer told me.</p>\n<p>In a joint statement, Monico and Spevack said, âWe look forward to helping Mr. Cohen fulfill what he has told us is his only mission&#8212;to tell the truth as he knows it and to turn the corner on his past life and taking ownership for his past mistakes by cooperating as best as he can with all governmental authorities in search of the truth.â</p>\n<h3>More Great

McKayâs political biopic <em>Vice</em> over the holidays.","body":"<p>If youâve been wondering how <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/people/ivanka-trump#intcid=dt-hot-link\"><strong>Ivanka Trump</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/people/jared-kushner#intcid=dt-hot-link\"><strong>Jared Kusher</strong></a> spent their <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/12/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-shutdown-vacation\">holiday vacation</a> at Mar-a-Lago, we now partially know. While in Palm Beach, Florida, the couple decompressed from their political power positions, and the stress of the government shutdown, by venturing out to the local multiplex to see a movie.</p>\n<p>The duo had an array of screening options. If they wanted to go light, they could have seen <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/mary-poppins-returns-movie-review-emily-blunt\">Mary Poppins Returns</a>.</em> If they wanted to feel hopeful about the next chapter of their lives, they could have checked out <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/jennifer-lopez-movie-interview\"><strong>Jennifer Lopezâs</strong></a> feel-good comedy <em>Second Act.</em> If they were in darker moods, they could have opted for the gritty <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/nicole-kidman-destroyer-big-little-lies\"><strong>Nicole Kidman</strong></a> thriller <em>Destroyer.</em> But for controversial key figures in a highly divisive political administration, the couple went in an interesting direction, according to <a href=\"https://people.com/politics/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-saw-vice-but-left/\"><em>People</em></a>&#8212;by seeing <em>Vice,</em> <strong>Adam McKayâs</strong> biopic about <em>another</em> controversial key figure in a highly divisive political administration: <strong>Dick Cheney.</strong></p>\n<p>Sure, it is a little curious why the presidentâs senior aides were at a Florida multiplex at all during a government shutdown. (Though <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/christian-bale-vice-heart-attack\"><strong>Christian Bale</strong></a> really is great.) And if they <em>were</em> going to wait out their administrationâs consequential political decision in a movie theater, why wouldnât they at least pick a different film? Arenât movies supposed to be escapes from our own dark realities?</p>\n<p>But there is another intriguing detail to the report: âPartway through the showing, [Trump] and Kushner and their Secret Service detail got up and left,â per <em>People.</em> âIt remains unclear what prompted the exit, though the witness describes it as abrupt.â</p>\n<p>What was the reason behind the sudden exit? A source close to the administration confirms to <em>Vanity Fair</em>âs <strong>Emily Jane Fox</strong> that the couple did see the movie during their vacation, and did exit early&#8212;though close to the end of the film. So they could not have been upset by Bale and <strong>Amy Adamsâs</strong> bedroom <em>Macbeth</em> monologue, which takes place about halfway through the film, or the split-second cutaway to a young <strong>Donald Trump.</strong> If they had been shaken by the portrayal of a morally bankrupt business executive pursuing his own personal interests inside the White House, they presumably would have left a little earlier in the film.</p>\n<p>So maybe it was the gory heart-attack details that got to them? Maybe the early exit was just a security precaution. Or maybe there was simply an issue with the babysitter&#8212;er, two nannies&#8212;at home.</p>\n<p><em>Vice</em> is not the only entertainment project premiering last year that McKay used to hold a mirror up to the members of the First Family. McKay also executive produces the HBO series <em>Succession,</em> which was partially inspired by the trials of Kushnerâs family.</p>\n<p>âThe show very much reflects our time&#8212;this whole idea of a generation of rich kids who have this sense of entitlement. We see examples of it every day in the press, particularly in relation to our POTUS,âÂ McKay told <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/hbo-succession-rupert-murdoch-trump-kushner-family\"><em>Vanity Fair</em></a> earlier this year. McKay wondered what Kushnerâs family might think of <em>that</em> project of his, telling us, âWould they watch it and be like, âOh cool, itâs us.â Or would they watch it and be like, âThose sons of bitches, how dare they?â My guess is they donât watch it. I would love to hear a reaction from one of these families.â</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/58b09b14fd2e6133ee000003.js?muted=1\"></div></div><h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Donât call it a Dernaissance, call it <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/laura-dern-cover-story?inline\">Laura Dernâs much-deserved close-up</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Ethan Hawke gets candid about the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/ethan-hawke-kevin-spacey-harvey-weinstein-little-gold-men-interview?inline\">Weinsteins and Spaceys of the world</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; âI have a little bit of control over my destinyâ <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/nicole-kidman-destroyer-big-little-lies?inline\">&#8212;Nicole Kidman</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Harrowing tales from the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/st-barths-yacht-season-pippa-middleton-jared-leto-les-moonves?inline\">St. Barthâs Yacht Convention</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The year ahead in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/the-year-ahead-in-royals-2019?inline\">British royalty</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hollywood newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"HOLIDAY VACATION","socialTitle":"The Mystery of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushnerâs Movie Date","socialDescription":"The D.C. power couple took in Adam McKayâs political biopic Vice over the holidays.","seoTitle":"Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushnerâs Mystery Movie Date","seoDescription":"Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushnerâalong with their Secret Service detailâtook in a surprising choice of movie over their holiday break.","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Award Season","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":[],"revisionAuthor":"Anna  Raya","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"interactiveOverride":"","id":"5c37cdf69565e41ee72418b6","revision":47,"createdAt":"January 10, 2019 5:57 pm","modifiedAt":"January 10, 2019 9:32 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 10, 2019 9:32 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Hollywood","slug":"hollywood","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fae03af0739cf33e0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Award Season","slug":"award-season","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120b4f5c10202b9717a","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Movies","slug":"movies","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120c639a3587939aa6b","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Julie Miller is a Senior Hollywood writer for <em>Vanity Fair</em>âs website.

He calls him âMr. Ingratitude.ââ","body":"<p>For months, <strong>Roger Stone</strong> has gone to bed on Thursday nights expecting to wake up with the feds at his door. âRoger has expected this every Friday since August,â Stoneâs friend <strong>Michael Caputo,</strong> who spoke with Stone last night, told me. So it was not a surprise when F.B.I. agents arrested Stone early this morning at his Fort Lauderdale home. âWe all knew it would be Roger Stone Day eventually,â Caputo said. âThe bad news is Roger Stone Day is here.â</p>\n<p>While not a shock, Stoneâs arrest on seven criminal counts&#8212;including obstruction, lying to Congress, and witness tampering&#8212;has  nevertheless sent ripples of fear through Trumpworld. âTrump is very worried,â a longtime Trump confidante told me. Chief among Trumpâs fear is the nightmare scenario that Stone flips to avoid years in federal prison and cooperates with <strong>Robert Mueller.</strong> âI could see Roger flipping pretty quickly,â a Republican close to Trump said.</p>\n<p>Emerging from a Florida courthouse, Stone said he will <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/roger-stone-wont-testify-against-trump-mueller-investigation-627d2307-bc96-4ff6-90dc-2a00932bf365.html\">never testify against Trump</a>. But the speculation that Stone could turn on his longtime client is supported by several factors. For one, Stone has a complicated relationship with Trump. The two met in 1979 when Stone was living at Roy Cohnâs Manhattan town house while working as a young staffer on Ronald Reaganâs presidential campaign, and it has rankled Trump that Stone is regarded as his political brain (Stone has <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/01/16/the_wall_stones_campaign_slogan_that_begot_the_shutdown_139185.html\">claimed</a> he created the âbuild the wallâ slogan). âStone and Trump are like an old married couple,â the Republican close to Trump explained. âStone knows Donald isnât loyal. He calls him âMr. Ingratitude.ââ</p>\n<p>Stoking Trumpworldâs fear is the fact that Stone is as predictable as an unguided missile. âDonald knows Roger wants to be a martyr,â the longtime Trump confidante said. Right now, Stone has cast himself as a victim of an overzealous prosecutor. His reckless goading of Mueller is the action of a man who seems like he wants to go to jail. âItâs good for his brand,â the confidante said. âItâs pathetic. Why didnât he just tell the truth?â former Trump adviser and Stone protÃ©gÃ© <strong>Sam Nunberg</strong> told me. But if given the chance to provide a <strong>John Dean</strong> moment that would ensure his place in the history books, itâs also possible Stone could recast himself as the hero of the Russia probe&#8212;while lightening his sentence.</p>\n<p>Lastly, some Trump allies fear that Stoneâs arrest presages more indictments by the special counsel. The presidentâs son, <strong>Don Jr.,</strong> has told people heâs worried he could be next, a source briefed on the conversations said. âUnderestimating Mueller is a failed tack,â a veteran of the 2016 campaign said.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The family drama surrounding <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/biden-2020-front-runner-family-divorce-drama?inline\">Joe Bidenâs presidential bid</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; What to make of the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/buzzfeed-mueller-saga-veteran-journalists-circumspect-confused?inline\">BuzzFeed-Mueller mystery</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; A happy ending for one <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/fyre-festival-caterer-gofundme-maryann-rolle?inline\">Fyre Festival contractor</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Intrigue in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jesse-angelo-abruptly-exits-the-new-york-post-murdoch?inline\">Murdoch-land</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Yes, <em>Schittâs Creek</em> really is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/yes-schitts-creek-really-is-that-good?inline\">that good</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Roger Stone Day","socialTitle":"âI Could See Roger Flipping Pretty Quicklyâ: Stone Faces His Time in the Barrel","socialDescription":"He professes undying loyalty.

The channel now officially named Fox Entertainment will have to transition from life as part of an integrated entertainment behemoth to an independent network that stands or falls on its own. But Collier made the case that this freedom from the 20th Century Fox studio could be a benefit: âWe will emerge free and nimble enoughâ to partner with all kinds of studios and talents that werenât possible before, he said. He also announced the launch of Sidecar, a âcontent acceleratorâ that will create original programming for the network and beyond.</p>\n<p>Fox had a strong fall, ratings-wise, thanks to its <em>Last Man Standing</em> revival, <em>Empire,</em> and <em>Thursday Night Football</em>. One recent disappointment was the live rendition of <em>Rent</em>, which went awry when one of its performers got injured during the showâs dress rehearsal. Collier defended the decision not to have understudies, saying that would have been impractical for a single-night live event.</p>\n<p>Although he did not originally greenlight the live <em>Rent</em> event, Collier also defended its relatively modest reach: he imagined it was not conceived as a broad national sensation, he said, so much as âan important story to tell.â He still sees live entertainment as an important part of Foxâs strategy going forward, and announced that <em>WWE Smackdown Live</em> would be moving to the network this fall.</p>\n<p>Asked about talent that might be concerned about being connected to a Murdoch-run Fox News sister network, Collier said, âI understand why itâs an issue for a lot of people, and appreciate and respect those who speak up about it.â But the bottom line, he continued, âis the news division and entertainment divisions are run completely separately.â</p>\n<p>Collier also cited a list of creators who are coming to Fox, including <em>Justified</em> showrunner <strong>Graham Yost</strong>(who is developing the series <em>Talent</em> for the network) and <strong>Amy Poehler</strong>, whose new animated series <em>Duncanville</em> is in the works. Also on the animated front is the new comedy <em>Bless the Harts,</em> created  by Emily Spivey and starring <strong>Maya Rudolph</strong> and <strong>Ike Barinholz.</strong></p>\n<p>Noting that âFox has risk-taking in its DNA,â Collier added, âTrue culture-defining hits can come from anywhere. No platform has cornered the market on story.â</p>","rubric":"TCA","socialTitle":"New Fox Wants to Be a \"Scrappy\" Start-Up","socialDescription":"âWeâre getting a new day one,â said Fox Entertainment boss Charlie Collier, who will have to steer the network as ABC scoops up 20th Century Fox assets.","seoTitle":"New Fox Wants to Be a \"Scrappy\" Start-Up","seoDescription":"âWeâre getting a new day one,â said Fox Entertainment boss Charlie Collier, who will have to steer the network as ABC scoops up 20th Century Fox assets.","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","interactiveOverride":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["fox","tca","new fox","tv"],"revisionAuthor":"Joanna Brenner","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5c5b1ca1da9c7009b9fbe357","revision":8,"createdAt":"February 6, 2019 12:42 pm","modifiedAt":"February 6, 2019 6:14 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"February 6, 2019 6:14 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Television","slug":"television","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120ae03af0739cf33e2","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Hollywood","slug":"hollywood","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fae03af0739cf33e0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"fox","slug":"fox","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7fcf023200b9deb29a6","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"tca","slug":"tca","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cbac1cb47e50b959735e9","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:33 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:33 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:33 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"new fox","slug":"new-fox","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb95f22e5400b9d093065","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:27 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:27 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:27 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"tv","slug":"tv","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7fd6c0055288786da19","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Anna  Raya","name":"Joy Press","bio":"Joy Press is a T.V.

Over the next several weeks, Gabbard went up to the starting line again&#8212;signaling to her team that a green light was imminent&#8212;only to make repeated retreats . . .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Gabbard did finally announce she would make a 2020 run, her team was blindsided. âI have decided to run and will be making a formal announcement within the next week,â she told CNN on a Friday night in a pre-taped interview for <em>The Van Jones Show.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gabbard campaign Web site was not ready to go live; social-media posts werenât ready to be sent out. And Gabbard hadnât signed off on the launch video.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The surprise announcement left Gabbardâs aides working frantically on a Friday night to get everything up online. Jones himself was surprised by her announcement and did not expect it to come on his show.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Leadership, too, is fractured. The campaign is reportedly planning a formal kickoff in Hawaii on Saturday, after which campaign manager <strong>Rania Batrice,</strong> the former deputy campaign manager for Sandersâs 2016 campaign and a well-regarded operative, is set to depart. Revolution Messaging, Gabbardâs consulting firm, will also reportedly sever ties with her campaign after the launch. <strong>Erika Tsuji,</strong> a campaign spokesperson, downplayed both departures, telling Politico that Batrice âis a longtime adviser and friend and remains so,â and that Revolution was hired solely for the launch, and âwe appreciate the work theyâve done to that end.â (In a statement to Politico, Batrice called Gabbard a âclose friendâ and wished her âall the best.â)</p>\n<p>As her campaign stumbles, Gabbard is starting plenty of fires elsewhere. After her announcement, her hometown paper published an <a href=\"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2019/01/22/editorial/our-view/editorial-gabbard-should-focus-on-her-job/\">editorial</a> recommending that she âfocus on her jobâ instead of a presidential bid. Hawaii state Senator <strong>Kai Kahele</strong> <a href=\"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2019/01/21/breaking-news/hawaii-sen-kai-kahele-officially-announces-2020-bid-for-congress/\">announced</a> earlier this month that he plans to challenge Gabbard for her congressional seat, saying somewhat pointedly in a video released on Martin Luther King Jr. day that Hawaii needs âleaders who put the common interests of Hawaiiâs people ahead of their own.â And Gabbard herself ignited a feud with Senator <strong>Mazie Hirono,</strong> one of the <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2018/07/25/americas-most-and-least-popular-senators-2/\">most popular</a> senators in the country, by <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/425006-gabbard-hirono-clash-shocks-hawaii\">âimplicitly accusingâ</a> her and other Democrats of having âweaponized religion for their own selfish gainâ in her questioning of a judicial nominee. (Hironoâs office shot back with a statement, calling it âunfortunate that Congresswoman Gabbard based her misguided opinion on the far-right wing manipulation of these straightforward questions.â)</p>\n<p>Though her heterodoxy had always alienated Gabbard from her Democratic peers&#8212;her strict anti-interventionist foreign policy, for instance, has won <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-conservative-media-and-the-far-right-love-tulsi-gabbard-for-president\">plaudits</a> from both the far left and the far right&#8212;Gabbardâs flirtation with the <strong>Joe Rogan</strong> constituency will likely win her few fans in a Democratic primary. If her campaign continues on its downward spiral, however, her message might never get a chance to break through.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The family

Last year, Kushner convinced Trump, who ran as a law-and-order candidate, to sign a bill that emphasized reducing recidivism rates, providing exemptions to mandatory minimum sentences, and expanding opportunities for early release in what was seen as a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/criminal-justice-reform-bill-metaphor-for-the-trump-presidency-that-wasnt\">strong step</a> toward improving the broken criminal-justice system. In that instance, however, he was simply nailing down specifics around a bipartisan consensus. As a senior White House official put it to Axios, âHe convinced Democrats to support something they already agreed with.â</p>\n<p>Thatâs not so with immigration. Here, Trumpâs marquee demand is his long-promised border wall, which he wants close to $6 billion in taxpayer dollars to build. Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, have no desire or reason to give it to him, particularly after Trump caved on his own request last week and reopened the government without a cent for the wall. To get Dems to budge, Kushner will have to offer a concession significant enough for them to consider yielding the upper hand. The problem, of course, lies in convincing his father-in-law to go along with such a concession, especially in the face of inevitable backlash from his base.</p>\n<p>Further complicating the issue is Trumpâs warning that, if a bipartisan panel doesnât come up with a workable solution by February 15, heâll either shut down the government again&#8212;something <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> and other Republicans on Capitol Hill have suggested they <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/427574-no-gop-appetite-for-a-second-shutdown\">could overrule</a>&#8212;or declare a national emergency to fund the wall without Congress. Putting the nuclear option on the table, as Trump apparently did against Kushnerâs wishes, may already have doomed a potential compromise. After all, what motivation does Trumpâs base have to go along with a middle ground when theyâre convinced he can easily avoid compromising altogether?</p>\n<p>Given all the obstacles in his path, even conservatives are questioning why Kushner thinks he can succeed where so many others have failed. âBorder security and immigration reform are much more complex issues than criminal justice reform,â Tea Party Patriots co-founder <strong>Jenny Beth Martin</strong> told Axios. Kushnerâs mandate, which includes nothing less than the reinvention of the executive branch itself, has always seemed comically broad, in part due to his total lack of relevant experience or expertise. But with two parties at total loggerheads, and apparently no confidence from the president, he seems especially in over his head, despite his insistence that heâs the one who can âland this plane.â âUnless heâs able to convince his father-in-law to abandon his obsession with building a medieval border wall,â Rep. <strong>Hakeem Jeffries</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/us/politics/jared-kushner-immigration-reform.html\">told</a> <em>The New York Times,</em> âthen heâs not going to be successful in finding a bipartisan

href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/gap-continues-to-widen-between-trump-and-intelligence-community-on-key-issues/2018/12/11/23a02cb0-f8db-11e8-863c-9e2f864d47e7_story.html?utm_term=.7eb27267495c\">reality gap</a> between <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and his spy chiefs, while always disconcerting, has grown to encompass far more than just Russia. According to a new <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf\">threat-assessment report</a> compiled by the U.S. intelligence community for the Senate Intelligence Committee, the presidentâs entire foreign-policy agenda is based on faulty assumptions, too.</p>\n<p>The 42-page document is an extraordinary rebuke of Trump, who has claimed in recent months that <strong>Kim Jong Un</strong> is a <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2018/06/donald-trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un-singapore-nuclear-1202408503/\">dear friend</a>, ISIS is <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-now-says-isis-largely-defeated-days-after-declaring-terrorist-group-had-lost\">essentially defeated</a>, and Iran is <a href=\"http://time.com/5407295/donald-trump-iran-united-nations/\">on the warpath</a>. Instead, as Director of National Intelligence <strong>Dan Coats</strong> and C.I.A. Director <strong>Gina Haspel</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/us/politics/intelligence-chiefs-senate-threats-.html\">told the Senate on Tuesday</a>, North Korea is âunlikely to give upâ its nuclear weapons, ISIS âstill commands thousands of fighters in Iraq and Syria,â and Iran is not âcurrently undertaking the key nuclear weapons-development activityâ to make a bomb.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday morning, Trump erupted on Twitter. âThe Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong! When I became President Iran was making trouble all over the Middle East, and beyond,â he wrote in a series of posts. âSince ending the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal, they are MUCH different, but a source of potential danger and conflict. They are testing Rockets (last week) and more, and are coming very close to the edge. There economy is now crashing, which is the only thing holding them back. Be careful of Iran. Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school!â</p>\n<p>Neither Coats nor Haspel directly challenged the president during Tuesdayâs hearing. But their testimony was, in its own way, a remarkable reminder of the disconnect between the commander in chief and the agencies that report to him. Whereas Trump has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/06/politics/trump-north-korea-second-summit/index.html\">insisted</a> that North Korea is well on its way to denuclearizing, and plans to meet with Kim later this month, Coats told the Senate that North Korea likely has no plans to do so, as âits leaders ultimately view nuclear weapons as critical to regime survival.â Haspel added that the regime has seemingly continued to develop a long-range missile, despite their claims they had begun denuclearizing. While Trump recently <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-now-says-isis-largely-defeated-days-after-declaring-terrorist-group-had-lost\">claimed</a> that ISIS was âlargely defeatedâ in Syria, justifying his controversial decision to remove nearly all troops from the region, Coats said that âISIS is intent on resurgingâ and that the group would âseek to exploit Sunni grievances, societal instability, and stretched security forces to regain territory in Iraq and Syria in the long term.â Haspel said Iran was less of a threat than Trump claimed when he <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/10/13/557622096/transcript-trump-s-remarks-on-iran-nuclear-deal\">withdrew from the Iran deal</a>, and âat the moment, technically theyâre in compliance.â</p>\n<p>Notably, the âWorldwide Threat Assessmentâ report does not say anything about building a wall along the southern border. Instead, it argues that the greatest foreign threats are technological in nature, including the risk of fake news, disinformation, and cyber-hacking. It specifically mentions China and Russia as the two greatest threats in that area:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At present, China and Russia pose the greatest espionage and cyber-attack threats, but we anticipate that all our adversaries and strategic competitors will increasingly build and integrate cyber espionage, attack, and influence capabilities into their efforts to influence U.S. policies and advance their own national-security interests. In the last decade, our adversaries and strategic competitors have developed and experimented with a growing capability to shape and alter the information and systems on which we rely. For years, they have conducted cyber espionage to collect intelligence and targeted our critical infrastructure to hold it at risk. They are now becoming more adept at using social media to alter how we think, behave, and decide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The overall threat assessment aligns with the national mood on foreign policy. A <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/1/28/18200489/trump-foreign-policy-poll-russia-north-korea\">recent poll</a> from the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research at the University of Chicago found most Americans have a grim outlook regarding the countryâs position in the world, with only 21 percent of respondents confident that Trumpâs approach would be helpful. The majority, 53 percent, said his foreign-policy agenda was making Americaâs position worse. Of course, as with all things partisan, the survey broke down along party lines: 76 percent of Republicans said they approved of Trumpâs approach, while 89 percent of Democrats disapproved; and in a reflection of the Trump base, 68 percent of Republicans said illegal immigration was âthe greatest threatâ to national security.</p>\n<p><em>This article has been updated.</em></p>\n<h3>More Great

So letâs just zero in on the money.\n<p>âIâm <em>really</em> rich,â Trump declared while announcing his candidacy in June 2015. To prove it, he released a âSummary of Net Worthâ balance sheet, indicating a net worth of $8,737,540,000. A month later he upwardly revised that figure to âin excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.â (The caps are his.)</p>\n<p>Since then, a cottage industry of spreadsheet-diving journalists has worked itself into a lather trying to peg his real net worth. But without tax returns to go on, itâs really anybodyâs guess. Despite the all-caps figures Trump has dispensed, most estimates from the established financial-media outlets have been lower, FAR LOWER. <em>Forbes</em> put his net worth at $4.5 billion. <em>Fortune</em> postulated $3.7 billion, and later upped it to $3.9 billion. Bloomberg guessed it was âcloser to $2.9 billion.â</p>\n<p>In response to these wanton guesstimates, Trump instinctually fired back at the guesstimators. â<em>Forbes</em> is a bankrupt magazine, doesnât know what theyâre talking about.â â<em>Fortune</em> has no idea what my assets areâ and âhas totally lost its way.â But the real sulfuric acid was reserved for the lowballers over at Bloomberg. As usual, Trump made it personal, even suggesting his âfriend,â the former New York City mayor, might be jealous. âMaybe Michael told them to do it,â Trump speculated in the <em>Daily Mail,</em> âbecause he always wanted to do what Iâm doing.â Perhaps wisely, <em>The New Yorker</em>&#8212;even with its legendary phalanx of persnickety fact-checkers&#8212;wouldnât venture any closer than âjust a back-of-the-envelope calculationâ of $2.56 billion, âwhich shouldnât be taken too seriously.â</p>\n<p>In November, Trump was elected president of the United States in a shocking turn of events. He lost the popular vote by some two million ballots.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/donald-trump","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"5748bf9ab58adb2f614da195","revision":5,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"August 1, 2017 5:46 pm","uri":"people/donald-trump"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Trump Reportedly Does All His Own Makeup","promoHed":"Trump Reportedly Does All His Own Makeup","dek":"If no tanning beds exist within White House walls, what is the source of Trumpâs infamous hue?","promoDek":"If no tanning beds exist within White House walls, what is the source of Trumpâs infamous hue?","body":"<p>Long before <strong>President Trump</strong> decried investigations of his office over Twitter, a gentler query dogged the celebrity businessman: how does he maintain his infamous orange hue, even while residing in wintry D.C.? Itâs a question that persists into the third year of Trumpâs tenure in the White House, and investigations of the matter have yielded surprising insight into the commander in chiefâs styling habits.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/us/politics/trump-tan.html\">The New York Times</a></em> pursued the idea as a matter of Trumpâs health, though a senior administration official only offered that Trumpâs notable tan&#8212;in February, no less&#8212;is the result of âgood genes.â Further investigation revealed that neither tanning beds nor spray-tan booths exist within the White House or Air Force One, at least according to senior officials. Former aide <strong>Omarosa Manigault Newman</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/death-spiral-why-omarosa-totally-triggered-trump\">wrote in a tell-all book</a> that Trump travels with a tanning bed, while lighter-hued circles around the presidentâs eyes have fueled speculation that he utilizes goggles to protect himself from ultraviolet rays.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, neither bronzer nor tanning cream has been observed among Trumpâs bathroom grooming products, at least when the president has offered a tour of the facilities to supporters. Trump, who suffers from rosacea, is reported to apply his own translucent makeup powder before television appearances, and has even adjusted the lighting at White House events to avoid appearing too orange on-screen. When possible, he prefers the natural light of the White House Rose Garden.</p>\n<p>Trumpâs orange hue has also proven a frequent source of media ridicule, even as <em>Saturday Night Live</em> star <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> has suggested makeup artists deliberately avoid exaggerating the shade&#8212;at <strong>Lorne Michaelsâs</strong> behest&#8212;so as ânot to over-orange anything out of malice.â Baldwin has otherwise described Trumpâs look as somewhere between âMark Rothko orangeâ and a âslightly paler Orange Crush.â</p>\n<p>The president is famously self-sufficient when it comes to appearance, even detailing the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/photos/2015/09/an-illustrated-history-of-donald-trumps-hair\">elaborate process</a> behind his signature swooping blond hair. And while an unnamed former campaign hand admitted Trumpâs orange glow is âa captivating story,â they insisted Trumpâs grooming habits are his own secret to keep.</p>","rubric":"45

on Friday, and has agreed to back pay some 800,000 federal workers the salaries they missed during the previous 35-day shutdown. But when it comes to the federal contractors who also went unpaid during that period&#8212;up to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/13/18223471/back-pay-federal-contractors-shutdown\">580,000 people</a>, according to one estimate&#8212;it gets trickier. âIâve been told the president wonât signâ anything that guarantees them back pay, Senator <strong>Roy Blunt</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-blocking-contractor-back-pay-gov-t-funding-deal-lawmaker-n971226\">told reporters</a> on Wednesday. âI guess federal contractors are different in his view than federal employees.â</p>\n<p>On the 2016 campaign trail, it was a well-known (but ultimately overlooked) fact that Trump <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-business-plan-left-a-trail-of-unpaid-bills-1465504454\">routinely refused to pay contractors</a> during his career as a businessman. But the idea of paying these contractors reportedly had bipartisan support, until <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> shot it down. A legislative source <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/429827-push-to-include-contractor-back-pay-in-funding-deal-hits-gop-roadblock\">told</a> the Hill that the administrative cost alone to pay back the contractors would be as high as the back pay itself, and that previous shutdown negotiations did not include this provision. âThat was not initially part of our deal,â Senator <strong>Richard Shelby</strong> explained. âI personally would rather keep it narrow in scope.â</p>\n<p>Other Republicans, such as <strong>John Cornyn,</strong> seemed to take joy in turning contractor pain to political gain. â<strong>[Nancy] Pelosi</strong> and <strong>[Chuck] Schumer</strong> should have thought about this and other collateral damage when they initially refused to negotiate on border security, something they are apparently now willing to do,â he told NBC News. âThousands of federal contractors have not been reimbursed from the 35-day shutdown,â Schumer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1095770911196831744\">said</a> in response to these reports. âThis issue is hanging in the balance. . . .

Against all known <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/science-explains-why-a-beard-makes-you-look-hotter_n_6618142\">beard science, which states men look better with beards</a>, his look is more of a bot that is getting better and better at this smiling thing every day. His family <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2018/11/26/lead-pamela-brown-dnt-trump-ignoring-everything-jake-tapper.cnn\">has not put much faith in science</a>, anyway.</p>\n<p>Juniorâs ex-stepmother, <strong>Marla Maples,</strong> was there, too, sitting a cool three seats away from him&#8212;close enough to look like theyâre a part of one big party, and far enough away that she could convincingly avoid eye contact. (In past years, <a href=\"https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/presidents-former-wife-a-regular-zang-toi-10987395/\">Toi has invited</a> Juniorâs mom and the presidentâs first ex-wife, <strong>Ivana Trump.</strong>) Between the biggest Trump boy and Maples was Fox Newsâ <em>Americaâs Newsroom</em> host <strong>Bill Hemmer</strong> and Fox News personality-turned-Don Jrâs girlfriend <strong>Kimberly Guilfoyle.</strong></p>\n<p>There at the fashion show, Junior told the press that heâs dating a cool girl. She fishes and shoots guns, he said, but also wears makeup and the fashions. â[Guilfoyle has] even been out with me down to Texas with some of my buddies there. They all go, âHey, itâs a guy camp. Are you sure sheâs going to be O.K.?â Iâm like, âDonât worry, boys. Iâm making you sign a waiver.

(Wow, canât believe this guy is co-signing a person dragging the American flag on the floor like that. What a shame&#8212;itâs like he doesnât even respect America anymore, etc.) The designer made a special stop at the end of the runway to kiss Guilfoyle and shake Donâs hand. Who knows what heâs thinking as he smiles down at the designer. My best guess? âSheâs going to destroy all of you,â over and over again, forever.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The dirty truth about <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/the-dirty-secret-of-el-chapo-downfall?inline\">El Chapoâs downfall</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; That time <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/brian-rea-modern-love-death-wins-a-goldfish?inline\">death took a break</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The 25 <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/25-best-movie-scenes?inline\">most influential movie scenes</a> of the past 25 years</p>\n<p>&#8212; Acupuncture and hypno-birthing?

Let Kochâs expert on water and chemical regulations decide.","body":"<p>Of all the federal agencies that fall under <strong>Donald Trumpâs</strong> purview, none embodies the administrationâs unofficial mandate to do the exact opposite of its stated mission quite like the Environmental Protection Agency. For the last two years, the E.P.A.&#8212;which, as a reminder, is supposed to be protecting human health and the environment&#8212;has done everything in its power to turn the planet into an ashtray and convince Americans that toxic chemicals are actually totally fine to drink, breathe, and otherwise ingest, all in an effort to help companies secreting those chemicals maximize their profits. Which is to say, we probably should have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/04/former-koch-official-runs-epa-chemical-research-1136230\">seen this one coming</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Trump administration has placed a former Koch Industries official in charge of research that will shape how the government regulates a class of toxic chemicals contaminating millions of Americansâ drinking water&#8212;an issue that could have major financial repercussions for his former employer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Dunlap,</strong> a deputy in E.P.A.âs Office of Research and Development, is playing a key role as the agency decides how to protect people from the pollution left behind at hundreds of military bases and factories across the country. . .He spent the previous eight years as Koch Industriesâ lead expert on water and chemical regulations, a position that typically includes helping companies to limit regulatory restrictions and liability for cleanups.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dunlap was hired in October, according to previously undisclosed documents. Since then, he has been extremely busy, having reportedly been involved in high-level meetings that preceded the agencyâs decision <em>not</em> to set drinking water limits for chemicals known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which âhave been linked with kidney and testicular cancer, as well as other ailments.â (In a statement, <strong>David Ross</strong>, EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Water, told the Hive: âDespite what is being reported, EPA has not finalized or publicly issued its PFAS management plan, and any information that speculates what is included in the plan is premature. The agency is committed to following the Safe Drinking Water Act process for evaluating new drinking water standards, which is just one of the many components of the draft plan that is currently undergoing interagency review.â) According to Politico, Dunlap has been able to avoid a Senate confirmation hearing in which his prior work experience might come up because Trump has not officially nominated anyone to run to office. (Dunlapâs <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/research/david-dunlap\">official bio</a> on the E.P.A. Web site declines to mention any of his employers during his âmore than 30 yearsâ working for âprivate industry, trade associations and as an environmental consultant.â) Currently, Koch subsidiary Georgia-Pacific, a paper and pulp conglomerate, is facing at least one class-action suit related to chemicals now under Dunlapâs purview.</p>\n<p>Kochâs various environmental crimes against humanity are laid out in several high-profile lawsuits over the past 20 years. According to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111005022145/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-02/koch-brothers-flout-law-getting-richer-with-secret-iran-sales.html\">Bloomberg</a>, âKoch Industries was assessed more than $400 million in fines, penalties, and judgmentsâ between 1999 and 2003, such as for dumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of aviation fuel into a Minnesota wetland. âYou want an independent, hardheaded scientific review of these issues; you donât want somebody who is already taking the industry party line,â <strong>Erik Olson,</strong> who heads up the Natural Resources Defense Councilâs public health work, told Politico. âThereâs a legitimate threat there and, from my perspective, the conflicts of interest that [Dunlap] has having worked as a regulatory compliance director at Georgia-Pacific raises questions about whether he can make those objective decisions or should be recused.â</p>\n<p>Dunlap, of course, is unlikely to be replaced by someone without a host of conflicts of interest given that the guy currently running the E.P.A., <strong>Andrew Wheeler,</strong> is a walking, talking conflict of interest, having <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/07/06/626525274/get-to-know-andrew-wheeler-ex-coal-lobbyist-with-inside-track-to-lead-epa\">served as a coal-lobbyist</a> prior to taking over the top job from departed Grift King <strong>Scott Pruitt.</strong> It is, in other words, par for the course.

The president showed up about 40 minutes late to his planned speech Friday morning in the Rose Garden and immediately began rambling about trade negotiations with China. He proceeded to go on a long tangent about trade, Brexit, Syria, and his plans for a second summit with North Koreaâs <strong>Kim Jong Un,</strong> all without the use of a teleprompter. Eventually he got to the point. âIâm going to be signing a national emergency,â Trump said. According to White House officials, the declaration will allow Trump to redirect $3.6 billion from the military, $2.5 billion from counter-narcotics programs, and $600 million from the Treasury to build a border wall that Congress refused to fund.</p>\n<p>Trump appeared resigned to being sued for what both Democrats and Republicans have denounced as an unconstitutional power grab. âWe will have a national emergency, and we will then be <em>sued,</em>â he explained, breaking into a strange sing-song voice. âAnd they will sue us in the Ninth <em>Circuit,</em> even though it <em>shouldnât</em> be there, and we will possibly get a bad <em>ruling,</em> and then weâll get another bad <em>ruling,</em> and then weâll end up in the Supreme <em>Court,</em> and hopefully weâll get a fair <em>shake,</em> and weâll win in the Supreme <em>Court</em> just like the <em>ban.</em>â</p>\n<p>The government lawyers who will inevitably have to argue that case were surely appalled by what came next. âWe have so much money. But on the wall, they skimped,â he said, complaining that Congress had not given him the $5.7 billion in funding he wanted. âI didnât need to do this,â he added, potentially undermining any legal justification for an emergency declaration. âBut Iâd rather do it much faster.â</p>\n<p>It is hard to capture in text the utter strangeness of the entire incoherent, self-defeating monologue. As always with Trump, the <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?457952-1/president-trump-sign-national-emergency-build-border-wall&amp;vod&amp;start=34\">full video</a> needs to be seen to be believed. But for those who canât bring themselves to watch 50 minutes of the president praising himself and berating reporters, here are the most absurd highlights:</p>\n<p><strong>On other emergency declarations:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Itâs been signed many times before. Itâs been signed by other presidents. From 1977 or so, it gave the presidents the power. Thereâs rarely been a problem. They sign it; nobody cares. I guess they werenât very exciting. But nobody cares. They sign it for far less important things in some cases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On executing drug dealers:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[In China] a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty. Our . . . drug dealer gets a thing called, âHow about a fine?â . . .  So if we want to get smart, we can get smart. You can end the drug problem&#8212;can end it a lot faster than you think.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On Paul Ryan, who advised him against focusing on the wall:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will tell you, Iâm very disappointed at certain people&#8212;particularly one&#8212;for not having pushed this faster.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On his biggest conservative fans:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âLook, <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do. Not of me. If I change my views, he wouldn&#39;t be with me. <strong>Rush Limbaugh:</strong> I think heâs a great guy. Hereâs a guy who could speak for three hours without a phone call. Try doing that sometime. For three hours, he speaks. Heâs got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world. I mean, this guy is unbelievable. Try speaking for three hours without taking calls. Taking calls is easy. âO.K., I&#39;ll answer this one, that one.â He goes for three hours and heâs got an audience thatâs fantastic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On his friendship with dictator Kim Jong Un:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was a very tough dialogue at the beginning. Fire and fury. Total annihilation. âMy button is bigger than yoursâ and âmy button works.â . . . [But] I like him a lot and he likes me a lot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On Ann Coulter, who has called his emergency declaration a scam:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ann Coulter,</strong> I donât know her. I hardly know her. I havenât spoken to her in way over a year. but the press loves saying âAnn Coulter.â Probably if I did speak to her, sheâd be very nice. I just donât have the time . . . I would speak to her, I have nothing against her. . . . But she&#39;s off the reservation. But anybody that knows her understands that. But I havenât spoken to her. I donât follow her. I donât talk to her. But the press loves to bring up the name âAnn Coulter.â And you know what, I think sheâs fine. . . . I just donât speak to her.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On where he gets his (debunked) statistics on immigration:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I get my numbers from a lot of sources, like Homeland Security, primarily. And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster. And you know what else is a disaster? The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, <strong>Kirstjen [Nielsen],</strong> for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration. Billions and billions of dollars a month. Billions and billions of dollars and itâs unnecessary. . . . I use many stats . . . you have stats far worse than the ones I use, but I use many stats. But I also use Homeland Security.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On why he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, Part I:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think the people understand what we do. . . . Prime Minister <strong>[ShinzÅ] Abe</strong> [gave me]&#8212;itâs the most beautiful five-page letter. Nobel Prize. He sent it to them. You know why? Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan. And they had alarms going off&#8212;you know that. Now, all of a sudden, they feel good. They feel safe. I did that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On why he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, Part II:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you look at Idlib Province in Syria, I stopped the slaughter of perhaps three million people, nobody talk about that. . . . Russia and Iran and Syria were going to go in and perhaps destroy three million people in order to get 45,000 terrorists. And I heard about it from a woman who had her parents and her brother living there. And she said, âPlease, please.â And I thought&#8212;I said, âNo. It canât happen. What are you talking about it?â âNo, theyâre going to. â And I come home and I read a certain paper where the story was there, that they were actually forming to go into&#8212;to, really, to really do big destruction. And I put out a statement that, âYouâd better not do it.â And in all fairness to Russia and Iran and Syria, they didnât attack. Or theyâre doing it surgically, at least. Saved a lot of people.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

when U.S. troops depart.","promoDek":"Americaâs allies âunanimouslyâ declined the Trump administrationâs request to pick up the slack in Syria when U.S. troops depart.","body":"<p>Yet again, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has jumped the gun. Last week, the Trump administration revealed plans to remove all American troops from Syria by the end of April&#8212;a position long championed by the president. The move rankled even some congressional allies like Senator <strong>Lindsey Graham,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">apparently</a> made his displeasure known to Acting Defense Secretary <strong>Patrick Shanahan</strong> over the weekend. Now, itâs clear lawmakers werenât the only ones blindsided by the planned withdrawal&#8212;key United States allies appear to have been left out of the loop as well.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/allies-say-they-wont-remain-in-syria-after-us-troops-withdraw/2019/02/20/62e503b2-3532-11e9-a400-e481bf264fdc_story.html?utm_term=.9c6870c65501\">reported</a> that U.S. allies âunanimouslyâ declined the Trump administrationâs request to pick up the slack fighting ISIS in Syria if the U.S. removes its troops in the spring, as Trump has apparently directed Shanahan to do. A senior administration official told the <em>Post</em> that allies have made it clear they âwonât stay if you pull out.â Trumpâs hasty move, then, could leave behind a powder keg. âItâs not safe to leave these enemies there, without any referee or mediating force,â said a U.S. official.</p>\n<p>His approach to Syria is the latest example of Trumpâs seeming tendency to push policy without working out the details, which has frustrated even some of his closest allies. âThatâs the dumbest fucking idea Iâve ever heard,â Graham evidently <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">told</a> Shanahan of Trumpâs withdrawal plan in a meeting in Munich last Saturday. The South Carolina Republican, normally a staunch defender of the president, has been venting about the administrationâs Syria policy since December, when Trump suddenly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/donald-trump-syria-troops\">announced</a> it would be up to other nations to fight ISIS there&#8212;despite also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1075397797929775105\">claiming</a> that the terrorist organization had been âdefeated.â Graham torched the policy, saying at the time that he would âhold the administration accountable for this decision,â and threatened hearings over the planned move.</p>\n<p>âItâs hard to imagine that any president would wake up and make this kind of decision with this little communication,â Republican Senator <strong>Bob Corker</strong> said at the time.</p>\n<p>But it appears thatâs precisely how Trump has approached one of the most complicated foreign-policy conundrums of his presidency. While the commander-in-chief seemingly continues to talk out of his ass&#8212;on Friday, he said he would announce the âeradication of the caliphate . . . over the next 24 hours,â but no such announcement has come&#8212;U.S. allies appear to be losing patience. Last week, French Foreign Minister <strong>Jean-Yves Le Drian</strong> <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/u-s-pullout-from-syria-benefits-iran-says-french-fm-1.6938647\">called</a> Trumpâs call for withdrawal a âmystery,â and British Foreign Secretary <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> has said that âthere is no prospect of British forces replacing the Americansâ in Syria. Their pushback has left Trump hanging. Whether it will be enough to force him to reconsider remains to be seen.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a

controversy.","promoDek":"The presidentâs daughter downplayed the project&#8212;and distanced herself from the controversy.","body":"<p>In the wake of recent reporting detailing <strong>Donald Trumpâs</strong> efforts to build a Trump Tower in Russia during the presidential campaign, <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> appeared Friday on ABC to downplay the controversial real-estate project&#8212;and put some distance between herself and the president. Asked by <strong>Abby Huntsman</strong> whether she had any concerns about the project, the senior White House adviser <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/08/politics/ivanka-trump-russia-investigation/index.html\">responded</a> that she knew âliterally almost nothingâ about a Trump Organization proposal to build a skyscraper in downtown Moscow, and said she had âzero concernâ that anyone in her family could be implicated in <strong>Robert Muellerâs</strong> investigation into Russian efforts to fix the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Of course, Ivankaâs account differs somewhat from various reports suggesting she knew a great deal about the project. According to <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/mueller-eyes-ivanka-don-jr-s-work-trump-tower-moscow-003012099.html\">Yahoo News</a>, both she and <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong> were involved in the project as far back as 2013, and were aware that former Trump lawyer <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> had been working to revive the deal. In October 2015, Trump Sr. signed a letter of intent to move forward with negotiations, but has continued to be evasive about the extent of his ambitions. In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress about the scope of the Trump Tower project, and BuzzFeed News recently reported that the president directed Cohen to say that those negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did, though the special counselâs office issued an unusual statement disputing the BuzzFeed story as ânot accurate.â</p>\n<p>According to the contested BuzzFeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation\">report</a>, both Ivanka and Trump Jr. received âregular, detailed updatesâ about the project from Cohen. Ivanka would reportedly have managed a spa at the tower, and per BuzzFeed, instructed Cohen to speak with a Russian athlete who had âsynergy on a government levelâ to move the project along. A spokesperson for the First Daughterâs attorney told BuzzFeed that she was only âminimally involvedâ in proceedings, and âdid not know about this proposal until after a non-binding letter of intent had been signed.â Her older brother, meanwhile, has testified under oath that he was only âperipherally awareâ of the plans.</p>\n<p>She contested the Yahoo report too, insisting that her involvement in the project was limited to recommending an architect. But in her interview with Huntsman, she offered additional explanations: the Moscow deal was one of many she was juggling, she was too busy to have paid much attention, and it never moved beyond a theoretical stage. âThere was never a binding contract,â she told Huntsman during the <em>Good Morning America</em> interview, part of which aired Friday. âI never talked to the&#8212;with a third party outside of the organization about it. It was one of&#8212;I mean, we could have had 40 or 50 deals like that, that were floating around, that somebody was looking at. Nobody visited it to see if it was worth our time. So this was not exactly like an advanced project.â</p>\n<p>âThereâs nothing there, yet itâs created weeks and weeks and months of headlines,â she added. âSo no, I have zero concern.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

(Trump has called <strong>Robert Muellerâs</strong> investigation a âwitch huntâ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=witch%20hunt%20from%3Arealdonaldtrump&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en\">dozens of times on Twitter</a>; other times he just blurts âwitch hunt!â without any context whatsoever.) Thereâs also the time he <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/donald-trump-fires-fbi-director-james-comey\">fired</a> the director of the F.B.I.; the private campaign to remove <strong>Jeff Sessions</strong> for failing to âprotect himâ; and the hiring of <strong>Rudy Giuliani,</strong> whose job has been to wage a public-relations war to âundermine the credibility of both Mr. Mueller and the Justice Department,â which has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/rudy-giuliani-robert-mueller-collusion-russia\">not worked out so well</a>. More recently, the president apparently used some precious hours of âExecutive Timeâ to try to install a friendly face atop the investigation into his hush-money payments during the election.</p>\n<p>Last year, according to the <em>Times,</em> Trump summoned his newly installed acting attorney general, <strong>Matthew Whitaker</strong>&#8212;the one he claimed to not know despite <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/trump-denies-knowing-whitaker-who-he-met-a-dozen-times.html\">meeting with him on at least 12 separate occasions</a>&#8212;to ask him a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1068442531887632384\">very legal and very cool</a> question. Could <strong>Geoffrey Berman,</strong> the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, take over the investigation into <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-played-central-role-in-hush-payoffs-to-stormy-daniels-and-karen-mcdougal-1541786601\">Trumpâs role</a> in paying porn star <strong>Stormy Daniels</strong> and former <em>Playboy</em> model <strong>Karen McDougal</strong> to keep quiet about their alleged affairs? In Berman, Trump obviously saw the perfect guy for the job, given his background as the son of a real-estate developer; his time <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/10/top-ny-prosecutor-geoffrey-berman-trump-appointee-recused-michael-cohen-inquiry/502367002/\">as a principal at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/rudy-giuliani-greenberg-traurig-resignation\">which previously employed Giuliani until the association likely became too mortifying to bear</a>; and his <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-thought-hed-picked-his-perfect-us-attorney-in-geoffrey-berman-he-was-very-wrong\">hefty donation to the Trump campaign in 2016</a>. In Whitaker, too, Trump presumably saw a guy with a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/matthew-whitaker-world-patent-marketing-scam\">somewhat elastic view of right and wrong</a>, who would be eager to do his bidding. But alas! It was not to be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Whitaker, who had privately told associates that part of his role at the Justice Department was to âjump on a grenadeâ for the president, knew he could not put Mr. Berman in charge because Mr. Berman had already recused himself from the investigation. The president soon soured on Mr. Whitaker, as he often does with his aides, and complained about his inability to pull levers at the Justice Department that could make the presidentâs many legal problems go away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The revelation not only highlights Trumpâs continued reliance on <em>Sopranos</em>-esque tactics while working in the White House, but also puts Whitaker in an awkward situation vis-Ã -vis potentially lying to Congress:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Whitaker, who this month told a congressional committee that Mr. Trump had never pressured him over the various investigations, is now under scrutiny by House Democrats for possible perjury.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A spokeswoman for the Justice Department told the <em>Times</em> that the White House never asked Whitaker to interfere in the hush-money investigation. âUnder oath to the House Judiciary Committee, then-Acting Attorney General Whitaker stated that âat no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counselâs investigation or any other investigation,ââ said <strong>Kerri Kupec.</strong> âMr. Whitaker stands by his testimony.â Meanwhile, it will undoubtedly shock you to hear that Trump has dubbed the whole thing âfake newsâ:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962\">https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962</a></p></blockquote></div><h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is Americaâs most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>âs 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, TimothÃ©e Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Stormsâ-a-brewin","socialTitle":"Report: Trump Tried to Muzzle Investigation into His Porno Payoffs","socialDescription":"The president thought he could install a friendly face atop the probe.

cull funds from âother sources.â","body":"<p>In the latest blow to his deal-maker persona, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> appears poised to sign the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/congress-reaches-deal-to-fund-quarter-of-trump-border-wall\">border-security deal</a> a bipartisan panel of Capitol Hill negotiators struck late Monday, despite the fact that it allots the president <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/12/18221468/congress-border-security-deal\">less money</a> in barrier funding than he was offered last year, before he shut down the government for five weeks. The president has made clear heâs no fan of the agreement, but with no Republican appetite for a second shutdown or unilateral action by the White House, and a Friday deadline looming, he may not have much of a choice&#8212;even as he leaves open the possibility of finding âother sourcesâ to get the sum heâs spent months demanding. âIâm not happy about it,â Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/12/trump-meeting-cant-say-happy-border-deal-remarks-ip-vpx.cnn\">told reporters</a> of the deal on Tuesday. âItâs not doing the trick. But Iâm adding things to it, and when you add whatever I have to add&#8212;itâs all gonna happen where weâre gonna build a beautiful, big, strong wall.â</p>\n<p>âItâs very simple,â he said.</p>\n<p>It makes sense that Trump isnât thrilled about the deal. It includes just $1.375 billion for border fencing&#8212;far less than the nearly $6 billion heâd been seeking to build a concrete wall, and less even than the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/418507-schumer-dems-oppose-spending-more-than-16b-on-border-security\">$1.6 billion</a> <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> had offered him before Trump shut down the government last year. For the guy who authored <em>Art of the Deal,</em> itâs unquestionably a defeat&#8212;a fact his base has already picked up on. Rep. <strong>Mark Meadows,</strong> one of Trumpâs top Hill allies, said on Monday that the bill âdoes not represent a fraction of what the president has promised the American peopleâ and suggested he shouldnât sign it. <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> Trumpâs Fox News id, called the funding measure a âgarbage compromiseâ when details first emerged.</p>\n<p>But Hannity has since softened, saying heâs ânot as concernedâ about Trump signing what heâd previously described as an âinsaneâ deal&#8212;as long as he also declares a national emergency to get the rest of the money for the wall. âThe president would need to declare a national emergency,â Hannity <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2019/02/12/sean-hannity-says-declaring-national-emergency-border-necessity/222852\">said</a> Tuesday. âThis is the time. That is a necessity.â Trump, too, has hinted that he could pull additional cash from â<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1095469449052868610\">other sources</a>,â a possible reference to the nuclear option heâs been threatening for weeks. âWas just presented the concept and parameters of the Border Security Deal by hard working Senator <strong>Richard Shelby,</strong>â Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1095469447933059073\">tweeted</a> Tuesday evening. âLooking over all aspects knowing that this will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources. . . . Regardless of Wall money, it is being built as we speak!â</p>\n<p>There is more than one way for the White House to tap those âother sources,â although each comes with potential legal hurdles. As Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/11/mick-mulvaney-border-wall-funds-1163996\">reported</a> on Monday, the White House has already developed plans to redirect unspent federal dollars as part of an executive order that would bypass Congress without requiring an emergency declaration. âThere are certain sums of money that are available to the president, to any president,â Chief of Staff <strong>Mick Mulvaney</strong> explained Sunday on <em>Meet the Press.</em> âSo you comb through the law at the president&#39;s request . . . And thereâs pots of money where presidents, all presidents, have access to without a national emergency.â Experts say the move would almost certainly provoke a challenge.</p>\n<p>For now, at least, Trumpâs signature on the bipartisan border deal would avert another destructive shutdown. But itâs not a done deal just yet. While the funding measure was agreed to in principle, Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2019/02/13/is-the-border-wall-deal-in-danger-of-falling-apart-392261\">reported</a> Wednesday that lawmakers have discovered some unresolved areas of contention as theyâve worked to finalize it. That could be troublesome with a Friday deadline fast approaching&#8212;especially when the ultimate decision comes down to an unpredictable president whose whims can change with the wind.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

the Republicansâ grip on the federal purse strings, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is set to bypass Congress and use the nuclear option to build his long-promised wall at the United States-Mexico border. Itâs a move that will trigger a tough, protracted legal fight&#8212;and one that could even cause a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/trump-declares-national-emergency-border-wall-funding\">rift within the G.O.P.</a>, where leadership previously warned the president against an emergency declaration.</p>\n<p>Democrats, naturally, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/national-emergency-blocked-courts-temporarily-doj-warns-white/story?id=61086962\">labeled</a> the move âcrazy,â âridiculous,â and something âall of us will come to regret.â But Thursday also saw renewed cries of alarm from Republicans. Senator <strong>Susan Collins,</strong> who has criticized Trump in the past, released a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorCollins/status/1096175131733475330\">statement</a> calling the administrationâs plan B a âmistake.â âSuch a declaration would undermine the role of Congress and the appropriations process,â Collins said, warning of the precedent it could set. Kentucky Senator <strong>Rand Paul,</strong> a proponent of limited government, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096149684840738816\">told a reporter</a> he was ânot in favorâ of the plan, saying that ârevenue raising and spending power was given to Congressâ and suggesting that going around lawmakers would be an abuse of executive power. And Alaska Senator <strong>Lisa Murkowski,</strong> whoâs stood up to the administration before, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096151375875133440\">said</a> she â[doesnât] think this is a matter that should be declared a national emergency.â</p>\n<p>âI wish he wouldnât have done it,â Senator <strong>Chuck Grassley</strong> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/14/gop-national-emergency-declaration-trump-1170697\">told</a> Politico. âI imagine weâll find out whether heâs got the authority to do it by the courts.â</p>\n<p>âI never thought that was a good idea,â Republican Senator <strong>Pat Toomey</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096153688681467905\">told a reporter</a>. âI still donât.â</p>\n<p>Trump had long suggested heâd employ the nuclear option, having previously called the bipartisan talks that led to this weekâs <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/congress-reaches-deal-to-fund-quarter-of-trump-border-wall\">border-security agreement</a> a â<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/trump-great-negotiator-gives-up-on-negotiating-border-wall-national-emergency\">waste of time</a>.â Heâd even <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/republicans-think-trump-nuclear-option-national-emergency-is-a-terrible-idea\">implied</a> that he would declare a national emergency during his State of the Union address earlier this month, but ultimately decided against it amid bipartisan backlash&#8212;including from Senate Majority Leader <strong>Mitch McConnell.</strong></p>\n<p>Now, though, Trump is planning to sign the bipartisan deal <em>and</em> employ the nuclear option. That will likely please his base, including <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> who signaled this week that the only way heâd give his blessing to the â<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-prepares-to-sign-garbage-compromise-on-border-wall-funding\">garbage compromise</a>â would be if the president accompanied his signature with a national emergency. Itâll also please some of his Capitol Hill allies, including <strong>Lindsey Graham,</strong> who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GarrettHaake/status/1096144722215743489\">said</a> Thursday that âthis is a political fight worth having.â</p>\n<p>It remains to be seen whether pushback from lawmakers can overcome the kudos from Trumpâs base. That, after all, is one of the defining problems of Republican criticisms of Trump: that his detractors, time and again, have proven far more pliable than his allies. McConnell, who had previously opposed the nuclear option, announced his support on the Senate floor Thursday. And even those who expressed concern with the maneuver seemingly left themselves wiggle room. Take <strong>Marco Rubio:</strong> the Florida Republican indicated he believes Trump may be violating the Constitution if he bypasses Congress to build the wall&#8212;but only went so far as to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenRubioPress/status/1096172609392254978\">say</a> he is âskeptical it will be something [he] can support.â âI will wait to see what statutory or constitutional power the President relies on to justify such a declaration before making any definitive statement,â he said.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping,

But in declaring a national emergency, the president risks a constitutional challenge&#8212;and causing lasting damage to the institution of Congress.","body":"<p>President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> will declare a national emergency to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, the White House confirmed Thursday afternoon, shortly after Senate Majority Leader <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> strode onto the Senate floor to announce that he would support the presidentâs power grab. âPresident Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action&#8212;including a national emergency&#8212;to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis,â Press Secretary <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Trump had <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-wall-national-emergency-shutdown\">long threatened</a> to use his executive authority to build the wall if Democrats refused to give him the $5.7 billion he had demanded, despite the protestations of lawmakers in his own party. McConnell himself <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/mcconnell-privately-cautioned-trump-about-emergency-declaration-on-border-wall/2019/02/01/5ff1262c-2646-11e9-81fd-b7b05d5bed90_story.html\">previously warned</a> the president against declaring a national emergency, concerned it would split the Republican Party. In <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-01/trump-hints-he-ll-discuss-border-emergency-at-state-of-union\">recent days</a>, Trump reportedly convened his staff and advisers to begin drafting a national-emergency declaration for the wall, as it became clear that the omnibus budget would not include money for his signature campaign promise; the latest iteration allocated just $1.375 billion for 55 miles of barriers, fencing, and other security measures. Conservatives, including some of Trumpâs top allies on Capitol Hill, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-prepares-to-sign-garbage-compromise-on-border-wall-funding\">panned the deal</a>. Fox News host <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> perhaps the presidentâs most influential outside adviser, called it a âgarbage compromise.â</p>\n<p>The presidentâs inability to build the wall, even when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, has been a continuing personal embarrassment. By declaring a national emergency, Trump can appease his base and save face&#8212;but he also risks a massive court battle. The move will likely trigger a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/01/trump-has-no-case-national-emergency/581356/\">constitutional challenge</a>, as it directly circumvents Congressâs power of the purse to address an emergency wholly manufactured by the president. Despite Trumpâs insistence that there is a crisis at the border, illegal border crossings are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/11/us/politics/trump-border-crisis-reality.html\">down substantially</a> over the last two decades. While there is a very real <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-theres-a-crisis-at-the-border-heres-what-the-data-says\">asylum crisis</a> at the border, the vast majority of people seeking refuge in the United States, such as members of several recent âcaravans,â typically present themselves at ports of entry in order to apply for protected status.</p>\n<p>Legal experts believe <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/trump-national-emergency.html?module=inline\">Trump could win</a> a court challenge over his authority to militarize border-wall construction, and the White House has been preparing for that eventuality. Asked Thursday if they are prepared to litigate a national-emergency declaration, Sanders said, âWeâre very prepared, but there shouldnât be [legal challenges]. The presidentâs doing his job. Congress should do theirs.â</p>\n<p>The larger problem identified by Republican critics is the precedent Trump would set by usurping Congress. After all, if Trump can decide that something qualifies as an emergency when he doesnât get his way, whatâs to stop a future Democratic president from deciding that something like climate change&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">an actual, global threat to humanity</a>&#8212;can be addressed by executive fiat? Trump himself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/535441553079431168\">tweeted</a> in 2014, âRepubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit &amp; because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress.â</p>\n<p>Indeed, shortly after Sanders confirmed Trumpâs intent to declare an emergency, House Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> issued a stark warning to Republicans. âJust think what a president with different values can present to the American people,â <a href=\"https://twitter.com/politico/status/1096153922228703233\">she said</a> during a press conference Thursday. âYou want to talk about a national emergency? Letâs talk about today, the one-year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America. Thatâs a national emergency. Why donât you declare that an emergency, Mr. President? I wish you would, but a Democratic president can do that. A Democratic president can declare other emergencies as well.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is Americaâs most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>âs 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, TimothÃ©e Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Emergency Wall","socialTitle":"Trump Chooses the Nuclear Option to Build His Border Wall","socialDescription":"The president hopes to save face after a stinging legislative defeat.

Shaw in New York City. He was astounded to learn about the growth of the Internet&#8212;2,400 percent a year. Bezos decided he had to find a way to take advantage of the demand. He made a list of what he should sell online, eventually settling on books. Along with his wife, MacKenzie, Bezos drove across the country to Seattle, making revenue projections for his company the whole time. In 1994, he incorporated the company as Cadabra but switched to Amazon after a lawyer misheard the original name as âcadaver.â In 1995, Bezos sold the first book  on Amazon.com: Douglas Hofstadter&#39;s <em>Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought.</em> When Bezos took Amazon public, in 1997, it was an unusual public offering for a tech company at the time. Amazon went public before it ever turned a profit. Bezos didnât expect Amazon to be profitable for several years.\n<p>Bezos popularized online shopping, and even when the dot-com bubble killed off many e-commerce companies, Amazon thrived. Amazon shares have only increased over time, and the company sells everything from clothes and music to cloud-computing services. Amazon has launched a smartphone and TV-streaming box. The company has revolutionized logistics, even reportedly leasing its own planes to move Amazon merchandise, so itâs no longer at the mercy of third-party shippers.</p>\n<p>But Amazon isnât Bezosâs only endeavor. He bought <em>The Washington Post</em> for $250 million in 2013, and Bezosâs space-exploration company, Blue Origin, became one of the first commercial companies to launch a re-usable rocket, and heâll likely keep churning out more creative endeavors with the passing of time. âWhat really matters is, companies that donât continue to experiment, companies that donât embrace failure, they eventually get in a desperate position where the only thing they can do is a Hail Mary bet at the very end of their corporate existence,â he told Business Insiderâs Henry Blodget.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/57436e05614dc9a45cb0a85c_hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg","credit":"By David Ryder/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"57436e05c1f81aa45c8117ef","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","description":"Getty: 450831356","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/jeff-bezos","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/57436e05614dc9a45cb0a85c_hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg","credit":"By David Ryder/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"57436e05c1f81aa45c8117ef","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","description":"Getty: 450831356","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"57362902ff97be4071973df0","revision":8,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/jeff-bezos"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"What to Do If Youâre Feeling Sympathy for Jeff Bezos, a Billionaire, After the Blog","promoHed":"What to Do If Youâre Feeling Sympathy for Jeff Bezos, a Billionaire, After the Blog","dek":"Before you cancel yourself, letâs break down these strange emotions.","promoDek":"Before you cancel yourself, letâs break down these strange emotions.","body":"<p><strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> blogged a blog Thursday night. If you havenât read it yet, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">go do so</a>. Itâs no literary masterpiece&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/jeff-bezos-mackenzie-divorce-partners-in-ventures\">again</a>, Bezosâs soon-to-be ex-wife, <strong>MacKenzie,</strong> was the writer in the family&#8212;but it is a barn burner, and it works on several levels. It lays out how the <em>National Enquirer</em>âs parent company, American Media Inc., allegedly threatened to unleash intimate photos of the Amazon founder unless his private investigators stop prodding into the tabloidâs methods and, more crucially, he agrees to publicly state that the company was not âpolitically motivatedâ when it exposed his affair with TV host turned helicopter pilot <strong>Lauren Sanchez.</strong> It also invites surprising sympathy for Bezos, a very rich man whose path to wealth and ever-tightening grip on the future of American retail complexify those impulses&#8212;to borrow a term dâart.</p>\n<p>For starters, the public-figure sympathy economy is already in a recession. Expressing the feeling out loud, or in writing or even just thinking it is almost always a mistake, what with people getting <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/milkshake-duck\">milkshake-ducked</a> at an hourly rate. It always comes back to bite you. Person X probably wore blackface at a party in the 80s. He probably touched something he shouldnât have. She probably has patronizing opinions on climate-change policy. Maybe she has bad tweets in the timeline. You thought you were showing your soft side, but it turned out to be your ass.</p>\n<p>And thatâs before we get to Bezos and Amazon, neither of which is exactly unimpeachable. Sure, Bezos has proven to be a decent steward of <em>The Washington Post.</em> But Amazon has its hands in technologies like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/business/amazon-alexa-conversation-shared-echo.html\">Alexa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/amazon-facial-recognition-orlando-police-department\">police already use its facial recognition technology</a>. The innovations draw criticism for the ways they play fast and loose with private data. Plus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/30/accidents-at-amazon-workers-left-to-suffer-after-warehouse-injuries\">numerous</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/business/economy/amazon-workers-sears-bankruptcy-filing.html\">reports</a> have alleged poor working conditions in Amazonâs warehouses. (Per <em>The Guardian,</em> âAmazon meanwhile insists that ensuring the safety of its workers is a priority and that it was âproudâ of its record.â)</p>\n<p>Yet, in this particular fight between two powerful, usually unsympathetic entities, one emerges with some pathos, and it has everything to do with dick pics.</p>\n<p>Bezosâs two main foes are <strong>David Pecker,</strong> chairman of A.M.I., and <strong>Dylan Howard,</strong> the companyâs chief content officer, who have something of a track record here. After âcatch and killâ tactics&#8212;wherein a news outlet obtains exclusive rights to a story in order to <em>not</em> publish it&#8212;got <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/nyregion/trump-american-media-michael-cohen.html\">pulled into <strong>federal prosecutorsâ</strong> investigation</a>, A.M.I. signed a non-prosecution agreement that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/publisher-of-the-national-enquirer-admits-to-hush-money-payments-made-on-trumps-behalf/2018/12/12/ebf24b76-fe49-11e8-83c0-b06139e540e5_story.html?utm_term=.5039d826c06d\">includes</a> both Pecker and Howard.</p>\n<p>Per Bezosâs blog, A.M.I. allegedly threatened to release compromising photographs if Bezos didnât meet its demands. In the e-mails, which Bezos says came from A.M.I., Bezos is asked to state that he has âno knowledge or basis for suggesting that A.M.I.âs coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.â Bezos believes that the request was motivated by political animus. (<em>The National Enquirer</em> and Trump are, or at least were, pals and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/is-national-enquirer-ami-ready-for-a-war-with-jeff-bezos\">Trump hates <em>The Washington Post</em></a>). Bezos claims to have refused, and tips his hand, alluding to an alleged dinner between an anonymous, Saudi-connected figure, Pecker, and Trump. (A.M.I. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/national-enquirer-publisher-believes-it-acted-lawfully-on-bezos-story-vows-to-investigate-matter.html\">said in a statement</a> that the company âbelieves fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos. Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him.â)</p>\n<p>Which brings us to the photographic leverage that A.M.I. listed. If you didnât think it could get any worse than <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jeff-bezos-leaked-texts-investigation\">âalive girl,â</a> beware, cursed images described herein:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Mr. Bezos face selfie at what appears to be a business meeting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ms. Sanchez responseâ&#8212;âa photograph of her smoking a cigar in what appears to be a simulated oral sex scene.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A shirtless Mr. Bezos holding his phone in his left handâ&#8212;âwhile wearing his wedding ring. Heâs wearing either tight black cargo pants\nor shortsâ&#8212;âand his semi-erect manhood is penetrating the zipper of\nsaid garment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A full-length body selfie of Mr. Bezos wearing just a pair of tight black boxer-briefs or trunks, with his phone in his left handâ&#8212;âwhile\nwearing his wedding ring.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A selfie of Mr. Bezos fully clothed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A full-length scantily-clad body shot with short trunks.  Â·</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A naked selfie in a bathroomâ&#8212;âwhile wearing his wedding ring. Mr. Bezos is wearing nothing but a white towelâ&#8212;âand the top of his pubic\nregion can be seen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ms. Sanchez wearing a plunging red neckline dress revealing her cleavage and a glimpse of her nether region.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ms. Sanchez wearing a two-piece red bikini with gold detail dress revealing her cleavage.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Per one of the e-mails published by Bezos, A.M.I. said releasing these photos now would not be politically motivated; Amazon shareholders deserve to know what its chief has been up to. The texts and pictures are newsworthy in other words, and they have a protected right to publish them. They just needed Bezos to agree publicly that they werenât tailing him for the presidentâs benefit or else.</p>\n<p>Bezos and his lawyers disagree. The story already broke, he writes in a number of words. The pictures would be superfluous, and plus, he owns the dick pics because he took them, and publishing the photos would constitute copyright infringement. Who knows how any of these arguments would each hold up in court, but wow, again Iâm feeling something odd in my gut, something Iâve never felt before. Is it? Could it be? Compassion? For a billionaire?</p>\n<p>Strange to feel sympathy for the richest person in history, isnât it? Itâs not how anyone except, like, Mr. Burns would expect to spend their Thursday night. Weâre much more used to our billionaires being out here <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/26/koch-brothers-americans-for-prosperity-rightwing-political-group\">flooding elections with cash</a> and trying to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-07/stop-demeaning-billionaires-such-as-howard-schultz\">suggest that the word itself</a> is some kind of slur. Bezos, the biggest billionaire, is trying to stave off a blackmailer. Heâs trying to maintain our shared innocence about what âtight black cargo pants or shortsâ could possibly mean. Heâs just trying to keep his modesty from entering the cultural conscious against his will and everyone elseâs will&#8212;everyoneâs will save for that of a man named Pecker.</p>\n<p>I take a little heart in the fact that itâs not a purely sympathetic response for this man, whose personal foibles and professional tactics have been covered at length. Itâs a selfish, projecting kind of sympathy. We canât make money like Bezos makes money, but we can send nudes. Some of us can even send dick pics! We are all vulnerable, our photos and our Internet histories are on the cloud just waiting for some enterprising person to hack us or betray us on a whim. Even the guy who <em>owns</em> cloud storage was not immune. What Iâm saying is that, in a way, his dick pics are <em>our</em> dick pics. Our dick pics are his dick pics.</p>\n<p>Wouldnât it be great, goes the thought experiment, that if we were in Bezosâs position and those photos were in danger of being seen by our grandmothers, we could write a Medium post and have half the Internet cheering us on against this complicated, but certainly nefarious foe? Wouldnât it be great to checkmate the blackmailer, to have gathered certain information about certain dinners with chairmen and certain presidents?

capabilities. âHe doesn&#39;t get distracted easily,â gushes one analyst.","body":"<p>The past few weeks have been pretty tough on billionaire <strong>Jeff Bezos,</strong> at least relative to his usual circumstances, and not those of, say, people who work in coal mines or <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2014/02/23/worse_than_wal_mart_amazons_sick_brutality_and_secret_history_of_ruthlessly_intimidating_workers/\">Amazon</a> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-warehouse-workers-share-their-horror-stories-2018-4\">warehouses</a>. In January, he and his wife of 25 years, <strong>MacKenzie Bezos,</strong> announced they were splitting up, in what could be the most expensive divorce in human history. Shortly thereafter, <em>The National Enquirer</em> published a story revealing his affair with <strong>Lauren Sanchez,</strong> and the sexts that went with it. Then, earlier this month, <strong>Donald Trumpâs</strong> tabloid of choice allegedly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-ami-medium\">tried to blackmail the tech founder</a>, threatening to publish, among other things, a âbelow the belt selfieâ&#8212;âotherwise colloquially known as a âd--k pick [sic],â unless Bezos agreed to drop his investigation into how his private correspondence ended up in the <em>Enquirer</em>âs hands.</p>\n<p>Normally, if the C.E.O. of a public company was caught in a scandal involving photos of his genitalia, the board would be under intense pressure by shareholders to say <em>you gotta go,</em> with Wall Street analysts writing concerned notes to clients about said C.E.O.âs ability to focus in the midst of thousands of stories being written about his penis. Luckily for Bezos, that hasnât happened, because 1) heâs the chairman of Amazonâs board, and 2) Wall Street apparently believes he has the unique ability to juggle running multiple businesses and nude-selfie drama all at once.</p>\n<p>âBezos is an individual who has the capacity to work on multiple fronts at the same time. He doesnât get distracted easily,â gushed <strong>Tom Forte,</strong> an analyst at D.A. Davidson who sees the Amazonâs stock price rising to $2,450 a share, in comments to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/08/investing/amazon-stock/index.html\">CNN</a>. âLook at his ability to concurrently advance Amazon, own <em>The Washington Post,</em> and develop Blue Origin from scratch. That has in no way detracted from his ability to run Amazon.â <strong>Norm Conley,</strong> C.E.O. of JAG Capital Management, agreed, saying he would not be selling his shares. Bezos, he added, is âa genius.â While conceding that âfrom a public-relations standpoint,â the whole thing is not âideal,â <strong>Anthony DiClemente,</strong> senior managing director at Evercore ISI, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/amazon-analysts-shrug-off-bezos-enquirer-saga-see-no-impact-on-the-stock.html\">told</a> CNBC, âI donât think the allegations have a direct line into the fundamentals of Amazon.â <strong>Ron Josey,</strong> an Internet analyst at JMP Securities, concurred, saying he âwould be surprised if it had a negative impact on Amazon.â (Amazonâs stock has fallen approximately 5 percent since the day before Bezos announced his intent to divorce, though, per CNBC, the reason for the decline âis likely the companyâs warning during the earnings call last week of increased spending and slowing growth in 2019.â)</p>\n<p>Of course, strong fundamentals and a penchant for multi-tasking likely arenât the only reasons analysts are sticking with Bezos. Their resilience probably also has something to do with the fact that, in taking the story into his own hands, Bezos is standing up to a âjournalisticâ enterprise that ranks several notches below the parasites that feed on pond scum&#8212;and, by proxy, its biggest presidential fan.</p>\n<p>âBezos is that extraordinary, and Amazon is that extraordinary, that he can bring down a bully,â <strong>Davia Temin,</strong> founder of crisis-management firm Temin and Co, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-08/jeff-bezos-extortion-and-embarrassing-pics-won-t-distract-me\">told</a> Bloomberg. âHeâs got the courage, and the position as the richest man in the United States, and I think his courage in standing up to the extortion is going to outweigh the details behind the extortion.â Is he still the founder of a company known for decimating competitors and grinding workers into the dirt? Sure! Would the tabloid fracas in which he is currently embroiled have taken down any other, equally horny exec? Probably! But with Bezos, the dick-pic moxie is strong.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Report: rich people on high alert for dick-pic leaks in wake Bezos scandal</strong></p>\n<p>Bezos may have the support of shareholders and a level of wealth at which he is, as Bloombergâs <strong>Matt Levine</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-08/you-have-to-know-whose-data-you-re-using\">put it</a>, âtoo rich to be embarrassed,â but not everyone enjoys those comforts. And presumably, those who donât are <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/02/08/bezos-selfie-leak-triggers-an-alarm-for-billionaires-everywhere/?xid=gn_editorspicks\">planning accordingly right about now</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Jeff Bezos alleged in a blog post Thursday that he was the victim of blackmail attempts by the publisher of <em>The National Enquirer,</em> it probably sent chills down the spines of billionaires everywhere. . . . Ask any family office about its biggest fears and cyber-security is near the top. Personal protection no longer involves just bodyguards and a top-notch alarm system. The Internet Age has seen a massive shift in people storing their most sensitive and personal data online, where itâs vulnerable to hacking and intrusion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>âThe perception among very affluent people is often, âI have this level of wealth, Iâm untouchable,ââ <strong>Mark Johnson,</strong> chief executive officer of Sovereign Intelligence, told Bloomberg. âBut the systems they have in place for protecting their personal identifiable information are very weak.â On the bright side, this whole Bezos situation will presumably result in a jobs boom for security experts who can keep, for instance, <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> or <strong>Bill Gatesâs</strong> nudes on lockdown.</p>\n<p><strong>Jared Kushner is going on a road trip</strong></p>\n<p>Itâs through the Middle East to promote his âpeace plan,â and apparently includes a pit stop at a special friendâs:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1093718582159163392\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1093718582159163392\">https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1093718582159163392</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Kushner, as you may recall, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia\">is tight</a> with Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman,</strong> who U.S. intelligence agencies say ordered the killing of journalist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi. That friendship came in handy when Donald Trump effectively <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/unusual-statement-disputing-cia-filled-exclamation-points-trump-backs-saudi-n938526\">decided to let the kingdom get away with murder</a> and is apparently <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/08/politics/white-house-khashoggi-deadline/index.html\">still going strong</a> despite a rather damning <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/us/politics/khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman.html\">new report</a> from <em>The New York Times</em> detailing audio of a conversation in which bin Salman reportedly said he would go after Khashoggi âwith a bullet.â</p>\n<p><strong>Steve Cohen begging someone to take Midtown duplex off his hands</strong></p>\n<p>In fact, heâs <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-08/steve-cohen-has-cut-price-of-nyc-apartment-60-to-45-million\">practically giving it away at this point</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The billionaire has dropped the price of his Midtown Manhattan duplex more than six times in six years and is now asking $45 million for the apartment&#8212;a $70 million discount to the $115 million he originally listed it for in April 2013.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cohen, the founder of Point72 Asset Management, bought the five-bedroom unit in One Beacon Court between 58th and 59th Streets for $24 million in 2005. He hired architect Charles Gwathmey, who renovated the Guggenheim Museum, to work on the 9,000-square-foot space. The apartment is the only duplex in the building.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to broker <strong>Victoria Shtainer,</strong> prospective buyers will theoretically be banging down Cohenâs door. âHe finally got it right, and the market will show him that,â she told Bloomberg.</p>\n<p><strong>Reminder: Trump hates illegal immigrants unless theyâre working in one of his businesses</strong></p>\n<p>Stop us if youâve <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/my-whole-town-practically-lived-there-from-costa-rica-to-new-jersey-a-pipeline-of-illegal-workers-for-trump-goes-back-years/2019/02/08/8cdbc1dc-2971-11e9-97b3-ae59fbae7960_story.html\">heard this one before</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The Washington Post</em> spoke with 16 men and women from Costa Rica and other Latin American countries, including six in Santa Teresa de Cajon, who said they were employed at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster. All of them said that they worked for Trump without legal status&#8212;and that their managers knew. . . . In Bound Brook, a majority-Hispanic town where many of the areaâs blue-collar workers live, the presence of illegal workers on Trumpâs staff was widely known, according to people in the community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âIt was far more systematic than two or three housekeepers,â said <strong>Joyce Phipps,</strong> executive director of Casa de Esperanza, a legal-aid organization for immigrants, who said she has had several clients who were Bedminster employees. âItâs been a very open secret.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a statement, the Trump Organization told the <em>Post:</em> âWe have tens of thousands of employees across our properties and have very strict hiring practices. If any employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately. We take this issue very seriously.â</p>\n<p><strong>Republicans: if Democrats are allowed to see Trumpâs tax returns, no one will be safe!</strong></p>\n<p>âThis isnât about the tax returns of presidents and vice presidents, but about making sure Congress does not abuse its authority,â <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-tax-returns-republicans-letter-democrats-1323466\">wrote</a> Representatives <strong>Mike Kelly</strong> and <strong>Kevin Brady</strong> in a letter arguing that the presidentâs tax returns&#8212;the ones he himself promised to release but strangely never has&#8212;must stay under lock and key. âWhere does it end?â Kelly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/us/politics/democrats-trump-tax-returns.html\">asked</a> during a hearing on Thursday, insisting itâs a slippery slope between allowing Democrats to see the <em>presidentâs</em> taxes, and the tax returns of every private American going public. âWhat about the tax returns of the Speaker? Members of Congress? Federal employees? Or, for that matter, any political donors? There is no end in sight for those whose tax information may be in jeopardy.â Of course, there is an end in sight, and itâs in the White House, whose inhabitantâs tax returns are the only ones Democrats are interested in seeing, on account of that whole <em>New York Times</em> investigation accusing Trump of âoutrightâ tax fraud, among other things.

publication threatened to release nudes if he didnât make a public statement supporting A.M.I.","body":"<p>Last month, the Daily Beast <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jeff-bezos-leaked-texts-investigation\">reported</a> that tech billionaire <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> had launched an investigation to determine how his private messages with a woman who was not his wife ended up in the pages of <em>The National Enquirer,</em> the hunch being that it was a politically motivated hit job. That Bezos, the richest man in the world, would put resources into determining how his sexts with <strong>Lauren Sanchez</strong> found their way into the worldâs sleaziest tabloid was not entirely surprising, and is probably what anyone else in his position would to do, too. That he would publish <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">a lengthy post on Medium</a> revealing the <em>Enquirer</em>âs attempts to seemingly extort him if he didnât drop the investigation was a bit more unexpected!</p>\n<p>According to Bezosâs post, his legal and investigatory team was approached by American Media Inc., publisher of <em>The National Enquirer,</em> with a demand to halt their investigation and tell the press they had âno knowledge or basis for suggesting that A.M.I.âs coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.â And if Bezos refused? Well, A.M.I. would have no choice but to make certain photos, detailed by its âChief Content Officerâ in the e-mail below, public:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From: Howard, Dylan [dhoward@amilink.com] (Chief Content Officer, A.M.I.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sent: Tuesday, February 5, 2019, 3:33 P.M.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To: Martin Singer (litigation counsel for Mr. de Becker)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Subject: Jeff Bezos &amp; Ms. Lauren Sanchez Photos</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CONFIDENTIAL &amp; NOT FOR DISTRIBIUTION [sic]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Marty:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am leaving the office for the night. I will be available on my cellâ&#8212;â917 XXX-XXXX.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, in the interests of expediating this situation, and with <em>The Washington Post</em> poised to publish unsubstantiated rumors of <em>The National Enquirer</em>âs initial report, I wanted to describe to you the photos obtained during our newsgathering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the âbelow the belt selfieâ&#8212;âotherwise colloquially known as a âd--k pickâââ&#8212;âthe <em>Enquirer</em> obtained a further nine images. These include:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Â· Mr. Bezos face selfie at what appears to be a business meeting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Â· Ms. Sanchez responseâ&#8212;âa photograph of her smoking a cigar in what appears to be a simulated oral sex scene.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Â· A shirtless Mr. Bezos holding his phone in his left handâ&#8212;âwhile wearing his wedding ring. Heâs wearing either tight black cargo pants or shortsâ&#8212;âand his semi-erect manhood is penetrating the zipper of said garment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Â· A full-length body selfie of Mr. Bezos wearing just a pair of tight black boxer-briefs or trunks, with his phone in his left handâ&#8212;âwhile wearing his wedding ring.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Â· A selfie of Mr. Bezos fully clothed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Â· A full-length scantily-clad body shot with short trunks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Â· A naked selfie in a bathroomâ&#8212;âwhile wearing his wedding ring. Mr. Bezos is wearing nothing but a white towelâ&#8212;âand the top of his pubic region can be seen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Â· Ms. Sanchez wearing a plunging red neckline dress revealing her cleavage and a glimpse of her nether region.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Â· Ms. Sanchez wearing a two-piece red bikini with gold detail dress revealing her cleavage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It would give no editor pleasure to send this e-mail. I hope common sense can prevailâ&#8212;âand quickly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dylan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In another e-mail, A.M.I.âs legal counsel lays out the terms of the extortion a bit more precisely:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From: Fine, Jon [jfine@amilink.com] (Deputy General Counsel, A.M.I.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sent: Wednesday, February 6, 2019, 5:57 P.M.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To: Martin Singer (Mr de Beckerâs attorney)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Subject: Re: EXTERNAL* RE: Bezos et al. / American Media et al.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Marty -</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here are our proposed terms:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>A full and complete mutual release of all claims that American Media, on the one hand, and Jeff Bezos and <strong>Gavin de Becker</strong> (the âBezos Partiesâ), on the other, may have against each other.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>A public, mutually-agreed upon acknowledgment from the Bezos Parties, released through a mutually-agreeable news outlet, affirming that they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that A.M.âs coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces, and an agreement that they will cease referring to such a possibility.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>A.M. agrees not to publish, distribute, share, or describe unpublished texts and photos (the âUnpublished Materialsâ).</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>A.M. affirms that it undertook no electronic eavesdropping in connection with its reporting and has no knowledge of such conduct.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>The agreement is completely confidential.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>In the case of a breach of the agreement by one or more of the Bezos Parties, A.M. is released from its obligations under the agreement, and may publish the Unpublished Materials.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Any other disputes arising out of this agreement shall first be submitted to JAMS mediation in California</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jon</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately for Trumpâs favorite publication, Bezos chose not to comply. âThese communications cement A.M.I.âs long-earned reputation for weaponizing journalistic privileges, hiding behind important protections, and ignoring the tenets and purpose of true journalism,â Bezos wrote, explaining his decision. âOf course I donât want personal photos published, but I also wonât participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.â</p>\n<p>A.M.I. is currently embroiled in a legal controversy involving publisher <strong>David Peckerâs</strong> friendship with <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and the <em>Enquirer</em>âs alleged practice of âcatch and kill,â or purposefully buying and burying incriminating stories. In August, Pecker cut an immunity deal with federal prosecutors who are probing an incident in which Trumpâs former attorney, <strong>Michael Cohen,</strong> negotiated a hush-money payment with A.M.I. to bury allegations by former <em>Playboy</em> model <strong>Karen McDougal</strong> that she had an affair with Trump. (Trump has denied the claim.) Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign-finance violations related to his role in facilitating payments to McDougal and to porn actress <strong>Stormy Daniels.</strong></p>\n<p>In a statement, A.M.I. said: âAmerican Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos.   Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him.  Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims.  Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.â</p>","rubric":"Blackmail","socialTitle":"Jeff Bezos Accuses National Enquirer of âD*ck Pickâ

takes on David Pecker, Trumpâs favorite tabloid may have finally met its match.","body":"<p>American Media Inc., the parent company of <em>The National Enquirer,</em> is under heavy scrutiny following <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-ami-medium\">explosive allegations</a> that it attempted to blackmail Amazon founder <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong>&#8212;and, according to a former <em>Enquirer</em> editor, the tabloid may be in over its head. âI think they thought they were smarter than they are,â <strong>Jerry George,</strong> the tabloidâs former Los Angeles bureau chief, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/donlemoncnn/videos/848877438777334/\">told</a> CNN Thursday night. âAnd I think now the reality is hitting them and theyâre freaking out.â</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">blog post</a> published Thursday evening, Bezos claimed that A.M.I., whose <em>Enquirer</em> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-alleged-relationship\">reported</a> on his affair with television anchor <strong>Lauren Sanchez,</strong> attempted to stop his investigation into how the tabloid had obtained his sensitive text messages by threatening to release intimate photos of the Amazon chief and <em>Washington Post</em> publisher. The apparent threat, as George noted, could open A.M.I. up to legal vulnerability&#8212;and comes after the company, whose C.E.O., <strong>David Pecker,</strong> is a close ally of <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> is still dealing with the fallout from its alleged role in quashing stories of women who claimed to have had affairs with the then-candidate.</p>\n<p>In 2016, the company purchased the story of <strong>Karen McDougal,</strong> a former Playboy model who claimed sheâd had an affair with Trump, with no intention of running it. The âcatch and killâ deal was arranged by <strong>Michael Cohen,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/cohens-guilty-plea-came-together-very-fast\">pleaded guilty</a> to campaign-finance violations last year related to his efforts to silence McDougal and porn actress <strong>Stormy Daniels.</strong> (Trump has repeatedly denied both affairs.) A.M.I. avoided prosecution as part of the scandal by <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/donald-trump-national-enquirer-allies-defect-david-pecker-michael-cohen\">agreeing</a> to cooperate with investigators&#8212;a move that, per my colleague <strong>Gabriel Sherman,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/donald-trump-national-enquirer-allies-defect-david-pecker-michael-cohen\">stunned</a> Trumpâs allies&#8212;âHoly shit,â a Trump friend told Sherman, âI thought Pecker would be the last one to turn.â (Pecker did not respond to Shermanâs request for comment.)</p>\n<p>But the apparent effort to blackmail Bezos&#8212;who has been repeatedly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1084627451983073280\">bashed by Trump</a> due to his ownership of the <em>Post</em>&#8212;suggests the companyâs shady behavior has continued. After Bezos revealed the alleged extortion effort, journalist <strong>Ronan Farrow,</strong> who famously <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-a-playboy-model-and-a-system-for-concealing-infidelity-national-enquirer-karen-mcdougal\">reported</a> on A.M.I.âs role in the McDougal saga for <em>The New Yorker,</em> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RonanFarrow/status/1093690150448758784\">tweeted</a> that he, too, had been the subject of a potential blackmail campaign by the company, in an effort to quash an investigation. He also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RonanFarrow/status/1093734749821194241\">wrote</a> that, according to his previous reporting, <strong>Dylan Howard,</strong> the <em>Enquirer</em> editor who attempted to turn up the heat on Bezos, is a close ally of <strong>Harvey Weinsteinâs</strong> and spearheaded a âsecret collaboration with . . . Weinstein to dig up dirt on accusers.â (In a lengthy statement to Farrow, Howard <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies\">maintained</a> that his relationship with Weinstein was professional and aboveboard; a spokesperson for Weinstein told Farrow that Howard âserved as the point person for American Mediaâs long-standing business relationship with The Weinstein Company.â) He added, âI did not engage as I donât cut deals with subjects of ongoing reporting.â</p>\n<p>On CNN, George theorized that the <em>Enquirer</em>âs efforts were connected to the president: âFor years, Donald Trump has had a hard-on for Bezos,â he said. âProfessional jealousy, the acquisition of Amazon . . . so itâs no surprise that he turned to his good buddy David Pecker . . . to do a hatchet job on him.â And yet itâs not clear whether the tabloid acted on Trumpâs behalf&#8212;back in August, a source close to A.M.I. told Sherman that he and Pecker hadnât spoken in months, and that Howard was âparticularly angryâ at the president, and felt âused and abused by himâ after the feds subpoenaed his employer. (Howard did not respond to Shermanâs request for comment.)</p>\n<p>Itâs equally unclear whether A.M.I.âs alleged threat constitutes a crime. The company has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/national-enquirer-publisher-believes-it-acted-lawfully-on-bezos-story-vows-to-investigate-matter.html\">maintained</a> it acted lawfully, and said that at the time of Bezosâs allegations, it was in âgood faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him.â But when the question was posed to him, <em>New Yorker</em> legal expert <strong>Jeffrey Toobin</strong> <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/cnn/rs-feb-07-2019?e=189f30aee3\">replied</a>, âI donât know.â Itâs a question that will be of particular concern to the publication in the coming days, especially considering Bezosâs allusion to others who have contacted his investigation team about âsimilar experiences with A.M.I.â A source familiar with the <em>Enquirer</em> <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/cnn/rs-feb-07-2019?e=189f30aee3\">told</a> CNNâs <strong>Brian Stelter</strong> there are indeed other such stories, predicting ominously: âIt will all come out now.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

Now heâs at the heart of a complexifier-ridden Hollywood-Silicon Valley-D.C. drama.","body":"<p>Until <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">accused</a> <em>National Enquirer</em> parent company American Media Inc. of extortion last week, <strong>Michael Sanchez,</strong> the brother of Bezosâs mistress, <strong>Lauren Sanchez,</strong> was known as a minor player on the margins of the entertainment industry. Michael had worked at ICM and MTV before becoming a talent manager and publicist, and his biggest client seemed to be his sister&#8212;a former television host-turned-helicopter entrepreneur who was married to William Morris Endeavor co-C.E.O. <strong>Patrick Whitesell.</strong></p>\n<p>But Michael Sanchez has since become a central character in the Bezos marriage drama. In late January, the Amazon founder and C.E.O.âs longtime security chief, <strong>Gavin de Becker,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/bezos-investigators-question-the-brother-of-his-mistress-lauren-sanchez-in-national-enquirer-leak-probe\">publicly suggested</a> that Michael Sanchez was possibly the <em>Enquirer</em>âs initial source of information on Bezosâs relationship with his sister. De Becker cited âpolitical motives,â as Michael is an avid <strong>Donald Trump</strong> supporter who could be imagined to have such motive to embarrass Bezos, who also owns <em>The Washington Post</em> (Michaelâs friends include <strong>Roger Stone</strong> and <strong>Carter Page</strong>). On Tuesday, the Associated Press <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/e199a6dd14aa4ac7808f58af842f948e\">reported</a> that de Beckerâs investigation had confirmed that Michael leaked Bezos and Laurenâs intimate text messages. The matter is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/business/media/jeff-bezos-ami-national-enquirer-fight.html\">being investigated</a> by federal prosecutors.</p>\n<p>In a series of interviews this week, Michael Sanchez carefully parsed his involvement in the imbroglio and provided his own counter-narrative. Specifically, he denied any involvement in the leak of the âbelow-the-belt selfiesâ that are at the core of Bezosâs extortion claim, not to mention a possible crime. âI had <em>nothing</em> to do with leak of the dick pics. Thatâs the important thing,â Michael told me. âI never had access. Itâs clear they were sent to others. There are, like, 20 dick pics. Lauren likely shared them with multiple girlfriends, not in a malicious way, thatâs not her style, but when sheâs in love, she got a kick out of sharing them. One time she tried to show me one and I was like, âWhat the fuck is wrong with you? I donât want to see that!ââ</p>\n<p>Michael was less declarative when I asked if heâd leaked his sister and Bezosâs intensely intimate texts, as the <em>Daily Beast</em> had first reported. (âI love you, alive girl. I will show you with my body, and my lips and my eyes, very soon,â Bezos allegedly wrote.) âIâm not saying I didnât do <em>something,</em>â Michael told me. âUntil I go under oath, what I can tell you now is that ever since April 20, when I met Jeff, my only goal has been to protect Jeff and Lauren.â (A spokesperson for Amazon declined to comment. Gavin de Becker did not return a call seeking comment.)</p>\n<p>Michaelâs claim that he is acting in Bezosâs best interest is difficult to fathom given that heâs been accused by de Becker as being the leaker and has maintained a friendly relationship with A.M.I. for years. But Michael insisted he âloves Jeffâ and wants his sisterâs relationship to succeed. Over the last year, he said, he served as an unofficial adviser to the couple as they discussed what would happen if their love affair leaked. âThey were talking marriage,â he told me. âThe three of us had discussed before that, at some point, this was going to be a scandal. My advice was, letâs get to the other side. Our analogy was always that they were landing a 747. I told them, âYouâre both pilots and youâve never landed a 747, but thatâs what weâre trying to do here.ââ</p>\n<p>In October, Lauren and Bezos had their first publicity scare when they spotted a paparazzo taking long-lens photos of them from the Santa Monica beach. Then, at dinner at Santa Monica restaurant Capo, Lauren noticed a reporter snapping photos of their table. Michael said they were increasingly nervous when they left the restaurant and Bezosâs car hadnât arrived. âWe were literally standing on the street with Jeff Bezos and his mistress. I got very protective of him. I said, âWe need to get you into an Uber,ââ Michael recalled.</p>\n<p>Two months later, they were outed. On the morning of January 7, Michael was on a Caribbean cruise when he was alerted that the <em>Enquirer</em> had called Bezos and Lauren for comment on their affair. âLauren and Jeff called me like 911. They were terrified,â Michael recalled. According to Michael, they discussed various options regarding how to respond to the story. One option even included Bezos buying A.M.I.&#8212;not such an outlandish consideration given the seriousness of the breach and the fact that, for Bezos, the price of the tabloid company is essentially a rounding error&#8212;to find out the source of the leak. âWe discussed the possibility to buy A.M.I.&#8212;not to kill the story, but to find out the source. They said thatâs not a bad idea. We discussed numbers and the name of the LLC that weâd use. It would be called BOBO LCCâ&#8212;short for Laurenâs helicopter filming company, Black Ops, and Bezosâs space company, Blue Origin&#8212;âthatâs the level of detail we went into.â</p>\n<p>Eventually, according to Michael, they settled on the plan that Michael would fly to New York on January 8 to meet with <em>Enquirer</em> editor <strong>Dylan Howard</strong> and find out what the tabloid planned to publish. But Bezos seemed to have changed his mind and went on the offensive, retaining powerhouse Los Angeles litigator <strong>Marty Singer.</strong> Early on the morning of January 9, before Michael met with Howard, Bezos tweeted out that he was divorcing his wife, <strong>MacKenzie.</strong> âLauren was blindsided by the tweet,â Michael told me.</p>\n<p>Michael blamed de Becker for the strategy shift, which he viewed as a dangerous escalation of the situation, and accused Bezosâs security chief of having selfish motives. The two advisers have been at odds in the press since the <em>Enquirer</em> published its exposÃ©. âLauren calls it a cockfight,â Michael said. The agendas of the opposing camps have produced competing theories as to who is to blame. In his <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">Medium post</a>, Bezos suggested a vast conspiracy involving Trump and Saudi Arabia and the possibility that his communications were hacked to damage him as payback for <em>The Washington Post</em>âs crusading investigation into the murder of <em>Post</em> columnist Jamal Khashoggi.</p>\n<p>But Michael Sanchez said Bezos and de Becker are framing the scandal as a pro-Trump political hit job to distract the public from a far simpler story: Bezos cheated on his wife and de Beckerâs security apparatus couldnât prevent Bezos from being caught. Michael said de Beckerâs judgment is clouded because he has been trying to break Lauren and Bezos up to protect MacKenzie Bezos, a close de Becker friend. De Becker reportedly told Bezos to agree to a 30-day physical separation from Lauren.</p>\n<p>Michael told me that his sister and Bezos continue to speak frequently and that the scandal âbrought them closer together.â Another source close to Lauren confirmed sheâs in contact with Bezos. âThe truth will come out about my motivations and how much I believe in Jeff and Laurenâs love,â Michael Sanchez told me. âItâs a legendary romance that will blow your mind as to just how in love they are. Jeff never blinked about losing $70 billion.â\n<em>This post has been updated.</em></p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is Americaâs most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>âs 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, TimothÃ©e Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Jeff Bezos","socialTitle":"âA Legendary Romanceâ: Michael Sanchez Spins His Role in the Bezos Affair","socialDescription":"Weeks ago, Sanchez was a minor player with a semi-famous sister.

All of this likely contributed to Bezosâs joint announcement with his wife <strong>MacKenzie Bezos</strong> (nÃ©e Tuttle), that the two would be divorcing after 25 years of marriage. And now, the worldâs richest man is launching a full-on investigation to determine exactly how the universe came to know that his idea of dirty text message is âI want to smell youâ and, most disturbingly, âI love you, alive girl.â</p>\n<p>The Daily Beast <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/bezos-launches-investigation-into-leaked-texts-with-lauren-sanchez-that-killed-his-marriage\">reports</a> that Bezosâs personal security team has been working to determine how the Amazon founder and <em>Washington Post</em> ownerâs private messages ended up in the pages of the worldâs sleaziest tabloid. Thus far, they donât believe it to be simply a case of Bezosâs phone being hacked, as a digital forensic analysis showed no evidence of such a breach. The team also looked into the possibility that Sanchez herself leaked the messages, but that theory, too, was unsupported by any evidence. Which leaves Bezos with a third theory that his security team is increasingly convinced could be legit: this whole thing was a political hit job, on account of his not-so-great relationship with <strong>Donald Trump:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That avenue of investigation stems from Bezosâs new role as a punching bag for President Donald Trump. The president gleefully promoted the <em>Enquirer</em>âs story, using it to hammer Bezos over his ownership of <em>The Washington Post,</em> which Trump frequently maligns as a hostile advocacy arm of Amazon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The fact that the texts ended up at the <em>Enquirer</em> has fueled Bezosâs investigatorsâ suspicions that the leak was politically motivated. The tabloidâs chief executive, <strong>David Pecker,</strong> admitted last month to using the <em>Enquirer</em> to facilitate a hush-money payment to one of Trumpâs alleged mistresses during the final weeks of the 2016 campaign. Pecker is a longtime Trump friend and ally, and [the] tone of his publicationâs coverage&#8212;it labeled Bezos a âschmuckâ in one story, for example&#8212;has struck investigators as even more venomous than typical <em>Enquirer</em> fare.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, given that Pecker and his publication have made âa concerted effort to distance themselves publicly from the president, and abruptly halted their previously routine, glowing coverage of Trump,â itâs possible the tabloid <em>wouldnât</em> go after Bezos just because <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/donald-trump-amazon-postal-service\">the president thinks Amazon is running some kind of scam on the Post Office</a>. Maybe they just thought it would sell papers.</p>\n<p><strong>Jon Hammond,</strong> a spokesman for <em>Enquirer</em> parent company American Media Inc., declined the Daily Beastâs request for

wonder why getting Bezos to back off was so important.","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>In mid-January, when <em>The National Enquirer</em> <a href=\"https://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-text-messages-affair-scandal/\">published</a> its epic exposÃ© revealing <strong>Jeff Bezosâs</strong> months-long extramarital dalliance, it was one of those once-every-so-often moments of mainstream credibility for the notorious supermarket tabloid. Bezos, after all, is the richest man in the world and the founder of a trillion-dollar company that has revolutionized the way we live, shop, and consume media. Some of the <em>Enquirer</em>âs language and packaging (steamy text messages and surreptitious dinner-date photos) was typically tawdry&#8212;but the fact that Bezos was having an affair and divorcing his wife of 25 years was major news no matter how you sliced it. The <em>Enquirer,</em> it seemed, had landed the scoop fair and square. Serious journalists were paying attention to the story, and talking about what it meant for Amazon, for Bezosâs reputation, and, of course, for the <em>Enquirer.</em></p>\n<p>For much of the previous year, the publication had been mired in a legal and public-relations crisis of its own making, thanks to its apparent role in muzzling women who alleged theyâd had affairs with President <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> a longtime pal of <strong>David Pecker,</strong> who is chairman and C.E.O. of the <em>Enquirer</em>âs parent company, American Media Inc. Now, in the wake of that ignominy, here was a massive newsbreak that put the <em>Enquirer</em> at the center of the news cycle in precisely the way it wanted to be. This was just what the tabloid needed given its recent history of dwindling circulation and staggering political scandal. It was proof that the <em>Enquirer</em> could still shine light on the misbehavior of the powerful, just as it had when it brought down <strong>John Edwards</strong> in 2007 through an <a href=\"https://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/john-edwards-love-child-scandal/\">exhaustive investigation</a> into the cover-up of the onetime presidential hopefulâs love child. It looked like a victory lap following a series of black eyes.</p>\n<p>A month later, to the <em>Enquirer</em>âs consternation, that script has been turned on its head, thanks to Bezosâs <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/bezos-wins-praise-for-his-essay-in-the-wapo-newsroom\">âballsyâ publication</a> of e-mails that appeared to show A.M.I. attempting to blackmail him with the threat of exposing a dick pic and other embarrassing photos. âIn the A.M.I. letters Iâm making public,â Bezos wrote in his <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">extraordinary post</a> on the Web site Medium, âyou will see the precise details of their extortionate proposal: they will publish the personal photos unless [security consultant] <strong>Gavin de Becker</strong> and I make the specific false public statement to the press that we âhave no knowledge or basis for suggesting that A.M.I.âs coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.â If we do not agree to affirmatively publicize that specific lie, they say theyâll publish the photos, and quickly.â</p>\n<p>The <em>Enquirer</em> now finds itself somewhere itâs not used to being: on the defensive. Itâs gone from trying to strong-arm Bezos into calling off the dogs investigating how the <em>Enquirer</em> came to possess his private texts, to becoming the subject of an investigation by the board of its own parent company, which said last week that it âwill take whatever appropriate action is necessary.â (The board has retained an outside firm to conduct the probe, according to someone familiar with the matter.) Worse for Pecker, the feds are now re-examining the immunity deal they struck with him last year, over the <em>Enquirer</em>âs involvement with former Trump lawyer <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> in paying off women who claimed to have slept with the president. There are signs, meanwhile, that do seem to point to a potentially politically motivated source. (Bezos owns <em>The Washington Post,</em> whose coverage Trump and his allies are no fans of.) The Daily Beast <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/mistress-lauren-sanchezs-brother-leaked-bezos-racy-texts-to-enquirer-sources-say-7\">reported yesterday</a> that its own sources say the <em>Enquirer</em> got the texts from <strong>Michael Sanchez,</strong> the brother of Bezosâs mistress, who moves in Trumpworld circles. (Sanchez declined to comment to the Beast.) During an interview with ABCâs <strong>George Stephanopoulos</strong> on Sunday, Peckerâs attorney, <strong>Elkan Abramowitz,</strong> described the leaker only as âa reliable source that had given information to <em>The National Enquirer</em> for seven years prior to this story. It was a source that was well known to both Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez.â Abramowitz also insisted that A.M.I. had acted legally in all of its interactions with the Bezos camp. (A.M.I. declined to comment for this story.)</p>\n<p>Even by <em>National Enquirer</em> standards, the whole episode has stunned battle-hardened tabloid veterans who thought theyâd seen it all. âThe history of tabloid journalism is rife with all sorts of behind-the-scenes deals,â said <strong>George Rush,</strong> the former <em>Daily News</em> gossip columnist. âBut to put that offer so bluntly and brazenly, to a man who has the intelligence and power to impale you on your own sword, was stupid.â</p>\n<p>âIâm as mystified as everybody else,â said <strong>Larry Hackett,</strong> the former longtime editor of <em>People</em> magazine. âIn light of everything theyâre facing, to be operating so close to the edge? Iâm not a lawyer, but to put on paper this kind of threat to the richest guy in the world who, also, by the way, owns <em>The Washington Post,</em> it just seems unusual. I think the story today is: why were they so determined and hell-bent to get Bezos to say itâs not political? Here is what the <em>Enquirer</em> is betraying that they donât normally betray: fear. The fact that they were so adamant to get Bezos to say that this wasnât political suggests a worry on their part, and nothing weâve seen in the past few days is gonna make that go away.â</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>In the media world, the <em>Enquirer</em> has spent the past few decades teetering on and off the brink of legitimacy. Under the stewardship of Harvard-educated editor-in-chief <strong>Steve Coz</strong> in the 1990s, it won acclaim for its dogged <strong>O.J. Simpson</strong> coverage. Similarly, the late-aughts <strong>David Perel</strong> era gave us the <strong>Tiger Woods</strong> cheating scandal and the Edwards affair, which put the <em>Enquirer</em> in the previously unheard of territory of Pulitzer Prize contention. The decades-old scandal sheet was getting favorable coverage from the likes of <em>The New York Times, The Washington Post, GQ</em> and <em>Playboy.</em> But as with all print media, market forces were beginning to work against it. Circulation was on the decline&#8212;it is now reportedly south of 300,000, down from a peak of around 6 million a week in the late 1970s&#8212;and A.M.I. was running into financing troubles that it continues to grapple with today.</p>\n<p>In early 2014, just before current editor-in-chief <strong>Dylan Howard</strong> took over, the <em>Enquirer</em> made waves for an embarrassing episode in which it got conned into running an interview with a prankster pretending to be <strong>David Bar Katz,</strong> a playwright and close friend of Philip Seymour Hoffman, who had just died of a heroin overdose. The fake Katz claimed in the article that he and Hoffman were cocaine-guzzling lovers, which indeed would have been a sizzling <em>Enquirer</em> scoop were it true. There was a correction and a libel settlement, and then-editor <strong>Tony Frost</strong> was ousted shortly after.</p>\n<p>The Howard era began with a much-needed redesign, a merry band of talented new recruits from the tabloid and celebrity-journalism world, a closer relationship with digital sister publication Radar Online, and the promise of returning the <em>Enquirer</em> to its roots of fearless shoe-leather sleuthing and rigid fact-checks, combined with unabashed checkbook journalism. Howard, after all, had bombshells like <strong>Mel Gibsonâs</strong> racist rants and <strong>Charlie Sheenâs</strong> drug test under his belt. âIt couldnât have come at a better time,â executive editor <strong>Barry Levine,</strong> who no longer works at the <em>Enquirer,</em> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/media/story/2014/07/the-enquirer-exposed-002583\">told me back then</a>. âWe needed a real jolt, something to freshen us up.â</p>\n<p>Trumpâs rise as a serious presidential contender in 2015 changed the equation, at least as far as public perception was concerned. The <em>Enquirer,</em> thanks to Trumpâs well-known affiliation with Pecker, came under scrutiny for doing kid-gloves coverage of the candidate, while at the same time unleashing a fusillade of stories suggesting that <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2015/10/in-the-enquirer-primary-clintons-campaign-is-dead-literally-214693\">virtually on the brink of death</a>. Even that behavior, though, would pale in comparison to Peckerâs admission last year that his <em>Enquirer</em> had acquired the rights to a <em>Playboy</em> modelâs story of having an affair with Trump, only to bury the story in order to help Trump ahead of the 2016 election. Federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York revealed they had agreed not to prosecute American Media Inc. in return for Peckerâs cooperation, and the deal stipulated that going forward, A.M.I. âshall commit no crimes whatsoever.â</p>\n<p>The e-mails that Bezos published last week would appear to suggest that A.M.I. may have already broken that promise. They also appeared to quash any notion that the <em>Enquirer</em> might start cleaning up its act. âI think the story of the worldâs richest man getting divorced is a good story. Thereâs no doubt about that,â said <strong>Martin Dunn,</strong> a former <em>Daily News</em> editor-in-chief who also worked at the notorious British tabloids <em>News of the World</em> and <em>The Sun</em> (and also wrote for the <em>Enquirer</em> under Generoso Pope Jr. in the late 1970s). âBut the subsequent interchange between the paper and Bezos is something Iâve never seen before. I have seen many scandals in newspapers in my time, but Iâve never seen a situation where people have been told thereâs a quid pro quo like that for stuff being run. That, to me, set a new low bar for tabloid behavior.â</p>\n<p>I asked Dunn how much damage he thinks the Bezos standoff could inflict on the <em>Enquirer</em> long-term. âLook, at the end of the day, it is a shadow of its former self,â he said. âThis was a sensational story, and it increased their profile for a short moment, but now it seems to have increased their profile for all the wrong reasons.â</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Media","socialTitle":"âA New Low Barâ: Tabloid Vets Say Blackmailing Bezos Was Inexplicably Stupid","socialDescription":"No one expects the Enquirer to

in July 2014, <strong>Dylan Howard,</strong> a charismatic Australian tabloid hound who had recently been named editor in chief of <em>The National Enquirer,</em> was sinking his teeth into a medium-well New York strip steak at Delmonicoâs, down in the Financial District. âI want to break the next <strong>John Edwards</strong> story,â he <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/media/story/2014/07/the-enquirer-exposed-002583\">told me</a> over lunch that day. Howard said the <em>Enquirer</em> was working on a âblack-opsâ investigation that would âshake the foundations of Washington D.C.â if the story materialized.</p>\n<p>It apparently did not. But four and a half years later, Howardâs <em>Enquirer</em> has shaken the foundations of Washington in a different way. The <em>Enquirer</em>âs <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/the-bezos-divorce-the-post-tries-to-sift-between-the-gossip-and-the-real-news\">mid-January bombshell</a> exposing <strong>Jeff Bezosâs</strong> months-long affair with <strong>Lauren Sanchez</strong> has put the infamous supermarket mag on a violent collision course with the worldâs richest man. Bezos, through his longtime security consultant, <strong>Gavin de Becker,</strong> has been investigating how the <em>Enquirer</em> got its hands on a trove of private text messages between Bezos and Sanchez. De Becker <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/bezos-investigators-question-the-brother-of-his-mistress-lauren-sanchez-in-national-enquirer-leak-probe\">told the Daily Beast</a> that âstrong leads point to political motives.â He also confirmed to the Beast that he has looked into <strong>Michael Sanchez,</strong> the brother of Bezosâs mistress, who is an associate of Trumpworld fixtures including <strong>Roger Stone</strong> and <strong>Carter Page.</strong> <strong>David Pecker,</strong> owner of the <em>Enquirer</em>âs parent company, American Media Inc., is a longtime Trump pal who cut an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/us/politics/david-pecker-immunity-trump.html\">immunity deal</a> with federal prosecutors last summer over the <em>Enquirer</em>âs involvement with former Trump lawyer <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> in paying off women who alleged theyâd had affairs with the president. (The deal stipulates that as part of the agreement, the <em>Enquirer</em> âshall commit no crimes whatsoever.â Federal prosecutors are now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/1093928245769236480\">reviewing</a> whether A.M.I. violated that deal.) Bezos owns <em>The Washington Post,</em> which Trump frequently attacks over the newspaperâs aggressive coverage of his administration.</p>\n<p>The Bezos-A.M.I. battle went nuclear on Thursday night when the ordinarily taciturn Amazon boss published an <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">extraordinary post</a> on the Web site Medium. âSeveral days ago, an A.M.I. leader advised us that Mr. Pecker is âapoplecticâ about our investigation,â Bezos wrote. âA few days after hearing about Mr. Peckerâs apoplexy, we were approached, verbally at first, with an offer. They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didnât stop our investigation. . . . In the A.M.I. letters Iâm making public, you will see the precise details of their extortionate proposal: they will publish the personal photos unless Gavin de Becker and I make the specific false public statement to the press that we âhave no knowledge or basis for suggesting that A.M.I.âs coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.â If we do not agree to affirmatively publicize that specific lie, they say theyâll publish the photos, and quickly.â</p>\n<p>The richest man in the world must have felt as if he held the higher cards: the letters from A.M.I.âs legal representation proposing a deal. âIf in my position I canât stand up to this kind of extortion,â he wrote, âhow many people can?â His riveting, rambling essay, built around the e-mails from A.M.I.âs counsel laying out their proposed trade, was a powerful statement about journalism that itself reached a place more intimate and dramatic than journalism can ever go. At its core was an unmistakable claim linking the <em>Post</em>âs coverage of the president with the <em>Enquirer</em>âs story and the deal its attorneys floated. âMy ownership of the <em>Washington Post</em> is a complexifier for me,â Bezos wrote. âItâs unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience <em>Washington Post</em> news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy. . . . Be assured, no real journalists ever propose anything like what is happening here: <em>I will not report embarrassing information about you if you do X for me. And if you donât do X quickly, I will report the embarrassing information.â</em></p>\n<p>Whatever one thinks about Amazonâs predations in other areas, Bezos has earned a reputation as an exemplary newspaper owner and staunch defender of journalism. After buying the <em>Post</em> for $250 million in 2013, he revived its fortunes by investing heavily in technology and newsroom resources. Under his leadership, the Beltway institution has come roaring back as a national media powerhouse, and it has been thriving in the Trump era both journalistically and as a business&#8212;one that now has a strong digital-subscription component. This episode has only bolstered Bezosâs standing within the journalism community, which collectively hopped on Twitter immediately after the Medium post went up to shower him with praise.</p>\n<p>By standing up to the <em>Enquirer</em> at the expense of his own personal privacy&#8212;the e-mails from A.M.I. executives, including Howard, warned that the <em>Enquirer</em> had âa âd--k pickââ&#8212;Bezos also seems to have made himself even more popular among his own employees at the <em>Post.</em> âEveryone Iâve talked to thought it was incredibly ballsy,â one <em>Post</em> journalist told me, âand kind of hilarious that we are a âcomplexifier.ââ As I <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/the-bezos-divorce-the-post-tries-to-sift-between-the-gossip-and-the-real-news\">reported</a> last month, it was initially unclear how the <em>Post</em> would go about covering the ramifications not only of its ownerâs affair, but the manner in which the affair was exposed. Now, the <em>Post</em> has clearly found its angle. On Tuesday, it published a fascinating and revelatory <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/was-tabloid-expose-of-bezos-affair-just-juicy-gossip-or-a-political-hit-job/2019/02/05/03d2f716-2633-11e9-90cd-dedb0c92dc17_story.html\">feature</a> going behind the scenes of the competing theories as to how the <em>Enquirer</em> investigation took shape: âWas tabloid exposÃ© of Bezos affair just juicy gossip or a political hit job?â Thursday night on MSNBC, <em>Post</em> reporter <strong>Manuel Roig-Franzia</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ndrew_lawrence/status/1093715333079318530\">offered up</a> a tidbit that sounded like the most potentially damning statement in the saga thus far: âGavin de Becker believes itâs possible that a government entity might have gotten hold of [Bezosâs] text messages.â</p>\n<p>Pecker, meanwhile, would appear to be licking his wounds. Thereâs already <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-08/bezos-allegations-could-upend-american-media-s-deal-with-feds\">speculation</a> that the blackmail allegations could blow up his immunity deal, which expressly warned against illegal activity over the next three years. On Friday morning, A.M.I. issued a cautiously worded statement on the matter: âAmerican Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos. Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him. Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.â</p>\n<p>The <em>Enquirer</em> has never been one to go down without a fight. Back when I spent some time with Howard in 2014, I sat in on a planning meeting during which Howard and his editors trashed a competing gossip outlet that had knocked down a recent <strong>Angelina Jolie</strong> scoop published by the <em>Enquirer.</em> âThe great irony is that someone took a cheap shot at us, but they still run the video on their Web site, because they still want the story,â he said, adding sarcastically, âTheyâll suffer the consequences!â He followed up with his newsroomâs unofficial motto: âDefeat is not an option.â Bezos and the Southern District of New York may be a different kind of adversary.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

scandal.","promoDek":"Lauren Sanchezâs Trump-loving brother is said to be âground zeroâ of the <em>Enquirer</em> scandal.","body":"<p><em>The National Enquirer</em>âs 12-page spread detailing <strong>Jeff Bezosâs</strong> affair with <strong>Lauren Sanchez,</strong> which included private text messages between the two, inspired an obvious yet burning question: who leaked the sexts, and why? Now, <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/mistress-lauren-sanchezs-brother-leaked-bezos-racy-texts-to-enquirer-sources-say-7\">a new report</a> from the Daily Beast has seemingly provided an answer: according to multiple sources inside <em>Enquirer</em> parent company A.M.I., the culprit is Sanchezâs Trump-loving brother, <strong>Michael Sanchez.</strong></p>\n<p>The apparent confirmation comes just days after Bezosâs <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-ami-medium\">blog post</a> alleging A.M.I. had attempted to extort him, demanding he drop his investigation into how the <em>Enquirer</em> obtained his texts, and publish a statement denying that the tabloidâs motivations were political, or suffer the consequences (the consequences, in this case, being the release of at least one âd--k pickâ). How Michael allegedly obtained the messages between his sister and the Amazon founder is still unclear, and as of late January, he <a href=\"https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/money-and-power/a26256501/michael-sanchez-lauren-brother-jeff-bezos-national-enquirer/\">denied</a> having anything to do with the leak. But according to reporter <strong>Lachlan Markay</strong> his motivations sure <em>sound</em> politically motivated!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Documents reviewed by the Daily Beast show that Michael Sanchez believed the <em>Enquirer</em> pursued its story about Bezos with âPresident Trumpâs knowledge and appreciationâ&#8212;a chase encouraged, in Sanchezâs estimation, by Republican operatives âwho THINK Jeff gets up every morning and has a [<em>Washington Post</em>] meeting to plot its next diabolical attack on President Trump.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He certainly was a reliable and public supporter of the president. âFor anyone too stupid or too bitter to admit Muellerâs pack of @POTUS-hating@TheDemocrats is leading an out-of-control witch hunt, read about @jerome_corsi,â Sanchez wrote in a more-or-less typical tweet. âMuellerism = McCarthyism.â According to <em>The Washington Post,</em> Sanchez said he had heard from A.M.I. staffers that the tabloid operation was in the middle of âa takedown to make Trump happy.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In an interview with ABC on Sunday, <strong>Elkan Abramowitz,</strong> a lawyer for A.M.I., told <strong>George Stephanopoulos,</strong> âThe story was given to <em>The National Enquirer</em> by a reliable source that had given information to <em>The National Enquirer</em> for seven years prior to this story. It was a source that was well known to both Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez.â Sources familiar with Bezosâs personal investigation, headed up by security consultant <strong>Gavin de Becker,</strong> told the Beast that âThere is no one inside this inquiry process who doesnât believe [Sanchez is] ground zero.â (de Becker reportedly interviewed Sanchez as part of his probe.)</p>\n<p>Of particular interest are Michael Sanchezâs alleged ties to <strong>Roger Stone</strong> and <strong>Carter Page,</strong> both key Trumpworld figures. (Stone is, of course, a former advisor to the Trump campaign who was indicted by the special prosecutor in January. Page was foreign policy adviser to the campaign who has also piqued the interest of <strong>Robert Mueller</strong>.) According to the Daily Beast, de Becker questioned Sanchez about his communications with both men, as well as with <strong>Scottie Nell Hughes,</strong> a pro-Trump commentator who now works for the Russian state television network RT. Stone, who was reportedly in contact with Sanchez in the days after the <em>Enquirer</em> story was published, told the Daily Beast that he has never hacked anyone and said that Michael Sanchez is a âvery good guy.â</p>\n<p>If Sanchez is indeed the leaker, many questions still remain to this dick-pic mystery: Why would he betray his sister? Do his ties to people in Trumpâs orbit come into play? And what, if anything, is the âSaudi connectionâ? (In his Medium post, Bezos noted that A.M.I. has âbeen investigated for various actions theyâve taken on behalf of the Saudi Government,â and noted that the suggestion the <em>Enquirer</em> might be tangled up with the Saudis seemed âto hit a particularly sensitive nerve.â)</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting

And after Bezosâs <em>Washington Post</em> published a front-page story on Trumpâs efforts to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-has-concealed-details-of-his-face-to-face-encounters-with-putin-from-senior-officials-in-administration/2019/01/12/65f6686c-1434-11e9-b6ad-9cfd62dbb0a8_story.html\">conceal</a> his meetings with <strong>Vladimir Putin,</strong> the president let fly: âSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better &amp; more responsible hands!â</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1084627451983073280\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1084627451983073280\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1084627451983073280</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The Bezoses are&#8212;were&#8212;the richest couple in the world, so their split, however tawdry some of the details, is a news story of giant import&#8212;as much import, say, as the presidentâs cover-up of an alleged dalliance with a porn actress. Bezos is the founder of a trillion-dollar company that has revolutionized the way we shop and live. In addition to Amazon, of course, he also owns one of Americaâs most powerful news organizations, which has been at the forefront of shaping our understanding of the current political crisis. Shouldnât one of Americaâs great newspapers be able to cover the hand that feeds it?</p>\n<p>Inside <em>The Washington Post</em> newsroom, the story is big news, if not yet entirely news of the printable sort. Various journalists that Iâve spoken with at the organization have suggested that writers and editors are ruminating about how the <em>Post</em> is going to proceed with covering&#8212;or not covering&#8212;the story as it continues to shake out. Reporting on oneâs owner or parent company is always a thorny affair. Some outlets, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/12/10/michael-bloomberg-still-doesnt-seem-understand-how-journalism-works/?utm_term=.ddb08324010a\">like Bloomberg</a>, just donât do it. (Although even Bloomberg is grappling with what to do if <strong>Mike Bloomberg</strong> decides to run for president.) Others, like <em>The New York Times,</em> have reputations for assiduous introspection. (Several months ago, the <em>Times</em> assigned five reporters to a front-page <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/business/media/james-wolfe-ali-watkins-leaks-reporter.html\">story</a> about a controversy involving one of its own journalists.) The <em>Post</em> is in a particularly tricky spot when it comes to these matters: it has the distinction of being owned by someone who also happens to be the richest person in the world, and therefore one of the worldâs most newsworthy people.</p>\n<p>The <em>Post</em> journalists I spoke with, perhaps high-mindedly, acknowledged that tabloid-style extramarital affairs arenât typically in their wheelhouse. âIf Amazon had a Facebook type of situation, which had tentacles in Congress, public documents, some sort of connection with the election, that would be far closer to our center of gravity,â one of them told me. âWe probably would not be putting a whole team of reporters on this in any case. But it does raise some questions.â</p>\n<p>At the same time, they donât want to appear to be ignoring the story. Another <em>Post</em> journalist told me that some reporters and editors are indeed having conversations about how to handle it and what angle would be appropriate. Is there a tech angle? A business story? Something for the Style section? This is, after all, the <em>Post</em>âs first real crucible, in terms of how to approach a big, controversial episode involving the boss. (The paper very admirably covered another recent story about itself, the murder of Global Opinions columnist Jamal Khashoggi, with fortitude and grace.) âThere has been some effort to figure out whatâs the threshold for us to write about this,â the <em>Post</em> journalist said. âItâs the first test case, and in the most uncomfortable and salacious territory possible. Itâs, like, canât you just give us a good old-fashioned tax evasion?â</p>\n<p>As of Monday afternoon, the <em>Post</em>âs coverage had been scant&#8212;an A.P. feed and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/01/09/jeff-bezos-announces-divorce-mackenzie-bezos-after-years-together/?utm_term=.5c796af91624\">an item</a> in the <em>Post</em>âs âReliable Sourceâ gossip column reporting on the January 9 news of the divorce itself. To be fair, it wasnât as if the <em>Post</em>âs main competitors were going wall to wall. The <em>Times,</em> for what itâs worth, ran a âWho Is MacKenzie Bezos?â <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/style/jeff-bezos-mackenzie-divorce.html\">feature</a> on the front page of its Monday business section, but beyond that, it hadnât really done much more than the home team.</p>\n<p>As for reactions to the scandal itself, my casual poll of journalists in different parts of the organization would seem to suggest that there arenât any fire alarms going off down at One Franklin Square. âThis is not an obsession,â one told me. âIt doesn&#39;t seem like there is much concern,â said another. I asked a third to rate the feverishness of the watercooler chatter on a scale of 1 to 10. âProbably a 2 or 3,â this person replied. âIâve had more outside friends ask me about it than Iâve had internal conversations.â</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, newsrooms are hotbeds of gossip, especially when the gossip involves powerful media figures, including a newsroomâs own executives. But Bezos enjoys substantial good will among <em>Post</em> journalists. It was the mogulâs personal fortune that rescued the organization in 2013, his copious investments putting it back on the path to journalistic glory under executive editor <strong>Marty Baron.</strong> And Bezos is generally viewed as a benevolent, hands-off patron who believes in journalismâs crucial function for society. (Perhaps mindful of his <em>Post</em> ownership, Bezosâs attorney <a href=\"https://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-text-messages-affair-scandal/\">told</a> the <em>Enquirer</em> that Bezos âsupports journalistic efforts and does not intend to discourage reporting about him.â) Additionally, while Bezos may end up splitting his estimated $137 billion net worth with his soon-to-be ex-wife, it does not appear that the divorce will have any obvious implications for the <em>Post,</em> financial or otherwise.</p>\n<p>Whatâs more certain is that if the <em>Post</em> does provide any further coverage, it will be closely assessed at the highest levels of the newsroom. âThis is something where it really would be Martyâs call,â one of my sources said. âWhatever the <em>Post</em> does, it will absolutely be with his blessing and careful attention.â</p>","rubric":"Media","socialTitle":"âThe First Test Caseâ: The Bezos Divorce Hits the The Washington Post","socialDescription":"The Post journalists I spoke with, perhaps high-mindedly, acknowledged that tabloid-style extramarital affairs arenât typically in their wheelhouse.

For Amazon, the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive, collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long-term. While polls show that 70% of New Yorkers support our plans and investment, a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project we and many others envisioned in Long Island City.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are disappointed to have reached this conclusion&#8212;we love New York, its incomparable dynamism, people, and culture&#8212;and particularly the community of Long Island City, where we have gotten to know so many optimistic, forward-leaning community leaders, small-business owners, and residents. There are currently over 5,000 Amazon employees in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Staten Island, and we plan to continue growing these teams.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The original deal was met with harsh blowback immediately after it was announced, on account of the fact that, despite the pledge to create new jobs, many people didnât think the richest company in the world, run by the richest man in the world, needed billions in incentives to move to a city where fellow tech giants like Google have <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/google-to-invest-usd1-billion-in-nyc-no-tax-incentives-needed.html\">come for free</a>. (That Amazon has said it will continue growing its teams in the other boroughs, sans subsidies, suggests it didnât.) On Twitter, Representative <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1062204614496403457\">wrote</a>: âThe idea that [Amazon] will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here.â Last week, State Senator <strong>Michael Gianaris,</strong> a major critic of the deal, was appointed to a state board that had the power to veto the whole thing, at which point Amazon <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/facing-opposition-amazon-reconsiders-ny-headquarters-site-two-officials-say/2019/02/08/451ffc52-2a19-11e9-b011-d8500644dc98_story.html\">reportedly</a> began to reconsider the move.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Gianaris basically told Amazon: <em>donât let the door hit you on the way out.</em> âLike a petulant child, Amazon insists on getting its way or takes its ball and leaves,â Gianaris told <em>The New York Times.</em> âEven by their own words, Amazon admits they will grow their presence in New York without their promised subsidies. So what was all this really about?â In addition to the subsidies, other perks of the deal that didnât go over super well with the public included a plan to move a distribution center for school lunches and give Bezos access to a helicopter pad.</p>\n<p>Among those for whom the announcement will 100 percent ruin Valentineâs Day? New York Governor <strong>Andrew Cuomo,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-governor-jokes-amazon-cuomo-name-change-hq2-2018-11\">said</a> last year he would change his name to Amazon Cuomo âif thatâs what it takes,â and in recent days <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/new-york-governor-cuomo-says-the-state-needs-amazon.html\">went after politicians</a> opposing the plan, calling their resistance âirresponsibleâ and âgovernmental malpractice.â Also: everyone who rushed to buy a place in Queens on the original news. âThis is like a gift from the gods for the Long Island City condo market,â <strong>Patrick W. Smith,</strong> a real-estate agent in the area, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-move-to-long-island-city-sparks-condo-frenzy-1542116117\">told</a> <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> at the time. âWhat happened today is a real tragedy,â <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-14/long-island-city-brokers-despair-over-amazon-s-abrupt-reversal\">said</a> <strong>Jason Haber</strong>, a broker with Warburg Realty Partnership Ltd, on the anniversary of an actual, <a href=\"https://splinternews.com/one-year-later-florida-students-join-together-to-remem-1832629945\">non-real estate tragedy</a>.

So, just a quick update: what he meant to say was that victims of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/14/18222167/trump-border-security-deal\">natural disasters will pay for it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Senate Majority Leader <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> said Thursday that Trump agreed to sign a package of seven spending bills that will fund nine federal departments including Transportation, Agriculture, and Homeland Security, narrowly averting another government shutdown. The president will also declare a national emergency at the same time, McConnell said. . . . By declaring a national emergency, Trump will be able to tap into funds otherwise dedicated to disaster relief or military construction projects, and redirect them to border wall construction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To recap, Trump demanded money for his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/upshot/trump-border-wall-polls.html\">deeply unpopular</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/border-wall-impractical-expensive-ineffective-plan\">completely pointless</a> border wall for more than two years, was denied at every turn, shut down the government, still didnât get what he wanted, and has now decided, <em>screw it, Iâll just take the money.</em> Itâs the sort of thinking that you would expect from guy whose father <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-fred-trump-taxes\">funded</a> one epic disaster after another, though <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/us/politics/trump-national-emergency-border.html\">not everyone is going for it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> of California said Democrats were âreviewing our optionsâ in responding to Mr. Trumpâs anticipated declaration and did not rule out a legal challenge. âThe president is doing an end run around Congress,â she said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She also raised the possibility that Mr. Trump was setting a precedent for Democratic presidents to come, precisely what Republicans fear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âYou want to talk about a national emergency, letâs talk about today,â Ms. Pelosi said, reminding Mr. Trump that it was the first anniversary of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. âThatâs a national emergency. Why donât you declare that emergency, Mr. President? I wish you would.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-08/trump-can-t-declare-national-emergency-to-build-border-wall\">noted</a> last month, âany attempt by Trump to get around Congress by using invented emergency powers would violate the Constitutionâ and would âalmost certainly would be blocked by the courts,â not to mention âconstitute a high crime and misdemeanor qualifying him for impeachment.â On the other hand, staying on the right side of the law has never been of particular importance to this president. And he wants his wall, god damn it! Heâs a builder! He builds things! Just give him the money, and no one gets hurt!</p>\n<p><strong>Youâll never believe it, but Trumpâs E.P.A. might have subverted science</strong></p>\n<p>After its takes on methane in the atmosphere (<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/trumps-insane-new-energy-policy-would-put-global-warming-on-steroids\">good</a>), fossil fuels (<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-team-advocates-burning-fossil-fuels-even-u-s-scientists-n946826\">good</a>), and asbestos (<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/donald-trump-asbestos\">very very good</a>), this report <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/epas-top-leaders-stymied-research-unit-report-finds-11550149201\">may or may not come as a shock</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An Environmental Protection Agency research unit tasked with evaluating chemicalsâ health risks has had its work hindered by the agencyâs top leadership, according to a government watchdog. The unit, known as the Integrated Risk Information System, or IRIS, is responsible for identifying dangers from chemicals in products such as paint and pesticides, and releasing assessments of their potential threats to human health.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A draft Government Accountability Office report found that âthe IRIS program has been unable to release any work since June 2018 while it was waiting for feedback from the Administratorâs office,â according to a copy reviewed by <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> The G.A.O. is a nonpartisan federal auditing agency that provides information to Congress. âIRIS program progress toward producing assessments was delayed by EPA leadership deliberations about priorities,â the draft said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The findings reflect a fundamental shift in thinking at agencies like the E.P.A., where Trump administration officials are challenging longtime practices, particularly around the use of science, said <strong>Bernard Goldstein,</strong> a professor emeritus at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health who oversaw EPA scientific programs under President Reagan. âTheyâve had these standard approaches, and now the standard approaches are gone,â said Mr. Goldstein, adding that he found this development troubling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a statement, E.P.A. spokesman <strong>James Hewitt</strong> claimed Trump-appointed officials at the agency <em>love</em> science, just not the commie kind used under Obama that prioritized protecting human health and the environment. âThe Trump EPA believes it is using the best available science to determine its proposed rules and regulations, just as the former administration believed it was doing the same thing,â Hewitt told the <em>Journal.</em> âHowever, this administration clearly has huge disagreements with the way the Obama administration carried out the agencyâs mission.â</p>\n<p><strong>But what about the ethics pledge?!</strong></p>\n<p>Hereâs another update you might want to sit down for: it turns out Trump wasnât actually serious about draining the swamp, unless when he said âdrain the swampâ he actually meant âre-populate it with officials from my own administration,â which he might have! Sometimes these things get lost in translation. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-lobbying-swamp-is-flourishing-in-trumps-washington\">Per ProPublica</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In his first 10 days in office, Trump signed an executive order that required all his political hires to sign a pledge. On its face, itâs straightforward and ironclad: When Trump officials leave government employment, they agree not to lobby the agencies they worked in for five years. They also canât lobby anyone in the White House or political appointees across federal agencies for the duration of the Trump administration. And they canât perform âlobbying activities,â or things that would help other lobbyists, including setting up meetings or providing background research. Violating the pledge exposes former officials to fines and extended or even permanent bans on lobbying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But loopholes, some of them sizable, abound. At least 33 former Trump officials have found ways around the pledge. The most prominent is former Interior Secretary <strong>Ryan Zinke,</strong> who resigned in December after a series of ethics investigations. He announced Wednesday that he is joining a lobbying firm, Turnberry Solutions, which was started in 2017 by several former Trump campaign aides. Asked whether Zinke will register as a lobbyist, Turnberry partner Jason Osborne said, âHe will if he has a client that he wants to lobby for.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ex-lobbyists, of course, also play a major role in the Trump administration, with one of the most prominent being acting E.P.A. administrator <strong>Andrew Wheeler,</strong> who had a bright career as a coal lobbyist before joining Team Trump. According to ProPublica, âat least 230 former and current registered lobbyists have worked in the Trump administration.â</p>\n<p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>New Jersey Governor Says New

Announcement?","promoHed":"Did the Tabloids Force Jeff Bezosâs Hand on His Divorce Announcement?","dek":"What to make of the first major gossip tale of 2019.","promoDek":"What to make of the first major gossip tale of 2019.","body":"<p>Who&#8212;many wondered after news landed Wednesday that <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> and his wife, <strong>MacKenzie,</strong> were divorcing&#8212;will he date now? Who will be the new companion to Americaâs wealthiest man, a shaper of jobs, titan of industry, and middle-aged space explorer? Our curiosity was apparently sated mere hours later when Page Six reported heâs allegedly been dating <strong>Lauren Sanchez,</strong> a longtime correspondent on Foxâs <em>Good Day L.A.</em> and helicopter-flight consultant for television and film.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, <em><a href=\"https://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-text-messages-affair-scandal/\">The National Enquirer</a></em> followed up, quoting what it claimed were text messages sent by Bezos to Sanchez sometime in April. The alleged messages are fine, though they suggest MacKenzie was really the writer in that marriage. Private messages made public are embarrassing, no matter how boring they are.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/jeff-bezos-divorce-lauren-sanchez-cheating-affair-photos-exclusive/\">teaser article</a> that preceded the main âbombshell,â the tabloid also bragged about stalking the pair from one luxury locale to the next and also Boston during a âfour-month investigation.â It claimed it followed Bezos and Sanchez âacross five states and 40,000 miles, tailed them in private jets, swanky limos, helicopter rides, romantic hikes, five-star hotel hideaways, intimate dinner dates, and âquality timeâ in hidden love nests.â</p>\n<p>So! Having now read the alleged receipts, letâs assemble the narrative as the tabloids have presented it. Sanchez and Bezos apparently first met the way most Hollywood characters usually encounter tech barons. In 2016 Bezos <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/jeff-bezos-newly-divorcing-now-seeing-lauren-sanchez-whitesell-1175047\">threw a party</a> for <em>Manchester by the Sea</em> with <strong>Matt Damon,</strong>  and Sanchez was present. He eventually hired Sanchez to take aerial shots in a helicopter for his aerospace company, Blue Origin, according to a <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/01/09/jeff-bezos-has-been-seeing-former-tv-anchor-lauren-sanchez/\">Page Six</a> source. Multiple sources also claimed to the outlet that Sanchez is separated from her husband <strong>Patrick Whitesell,</strong> the co-C.E.O. of Hollywood talent agency W.M.E., and <a href=\"https://people.com/movies/who-is-lauren-sanchez-dating-jeff-bezos/\">an insider</a> claimed to <em>People</em> that the marriage has been âon-and-offâ for some time. A lawyer for Bezos told the <em>Enquirer</em> that he and MacKenzie had been âlong separated.â It all seems subdued when compared to the usual tabloid exploits of the nation-state rich, and the next-level maturity persists, as Sanchez and Bezos were <a href=\"https://people.com/movies/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-patrick-whitesell-attended-amazon-golden-globes-party/\">even at the same Golden Globes</a> party on Sunday, along with Whitesell.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, effort was seemingly made to tamp down the <em>scandale</em> of it all on Wednesday when Bezos posted a statement calmly announcing the divorce. It reads in part: âAs our family and close friends know, after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends.â For the majority of Americans who, unlike the <em>Enquirer,</em> are not close Bezos-watchers, it came out of nowhere.  Part of the shock may be because many folks <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/jeff-bezos-was-married-is-now-divorced-1831606656\">hadnât internalized the fact that Bezos was married</a>, and now they may have to contend with a new girlfriend? Itâs a lot to take in. Many New Yorkers havenât forgiven the guy for commandeering Long Island City yet. Maybe the conspiracy-minded see this as a distraction, a little dirt-dishing to deflect attention from the rents that have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/22/realestate/what-amazon-means-for-long-island-city.html\">already gone up</a>&#8212;no wonder <a href=\"https://slate.com/business/2018/11/amazons-new-york-hq2-helipad-jeff-bezos.html\">he wanted that helipad</a>.</p>\n<p>Remove all the gossip packaging and the billions hanging in the balance, and a surprisingly pedestrian story writes itself. Namely, they allegedly worked together and were neighbors&#8212;both couples had houses in Seattle, per a Page Six source&#8212;and then they allegedly started dating. (Bezos and Sanchez did not respond to requests for comment by Page Six.) And despite all the stalking and intrigue and the power players involved, the story as itâs been set forth by a tabloid or two with all its holes and unconfirmed details, so far, is a familiar tale of a man seeking a new relationship after a divorce.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Nothing says grace like <a

handsome and preppily primped, Evan Spiegel looks every bit the part of the privileged Pacific Palisades-raised, Crossroads then Stanford-educated son of a pair of high-powered attorneys. Spiegel grew up in an affluent world resplendent with multimillion-dollar homes, Lexuses, private-club memberships, personal chefs, and spring breaks in Maui.\n<p>At Stanford, Spiegel joined Kappa Sigma, where he organized ragers and e-blasted his bros such indelicate commandments as âput your large kappa sigma dick down her throat.â (He later apologized after Valleywag leaked a few of those e-mails, admitting to Business Insider that he was âmortified and embarrassedâ by them). But instead of beelining it to Wall Street, as many self-respecting privileged frat boys might, Spiegel dropped out of Stanford&#8212;weeks shy of graduation&#8212;to launch an app with two fellow Kappa Sigma brothers, Bobby Murphy and Reggie Brown.</p>\n<p>The prototype they came up with was called Picaboo. The premise was simple: people could send one another photos that would self-destruct 10 seconds after being viewed. The advantage for the Anthony Weiners of the world is obvious. Critics, however, quickly pointed out workarounds to the disappearing act, such as screenshots and third-party apps, forcing Snapchat to settle charges with the F.T.C. that it had mislead users.</p>\n<p>Despite the early privacy hiccups, Snapchat has continued to thrive, rolling out messaging and then video chat features (with a range of hokey visual effects available to users with time to burn) and, of course, extremely coveted partnerships with media brands, known as Discover channels. Spiegel even turned down an eye-popping $3 billion offer from Mark Zuckerberg in 2013 to buy Snapchat.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Spiegel seems to possess Zuckerbergâs extraordinary aptitude for not only technology but also business development. Snapchatâs video views have grown at a dizzying pace, recently climbing as high as 10 billion a day, according to Bloomberg. (Facebook recently reported eight billion daily video views). The company has finally started to attract some serious ad revenue&#8212;$300 million is projected for this year&#8212;and was recently valued at $16 billion. After he rejected Zuckerbergâs offer, <em>Forbes</em> predicted Spiegel would âeither become the next great billionaire prodigy or the ultimate cautionary tale of youthful hubris.â Looks like Spiegel is already well on his way to the former.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/01/574f4833ee949d2f61432486_hive-contributor-profile-evan-spiegel.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:40 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-evan-spiegel.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-evan-spiegel.jpg","credit":"By Michael Kovac/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574f4832b58adb2f614da237","createdAt":"June 1, 2016 4:40 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:40 pm","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/evan-spiegel","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/01/574f4833ee949d2f61432486_hive-contributor-profile-evan-spiegel.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:40 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-evan-spiegel.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-evan-spiegel.jpg","credit":"By Michael Kovac/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574f4832b58adb2f614da237","createdAt":"June 1, 2016 4:40 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:40 pm","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"574f483fbdf148e4205f29e6","revision":0,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/evan-spiegel"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"âAnything Is Possible When It Comes to Evan Spiegelâ: Is a Snap Sale Inevitable?","promoHed":"âAnything Is Possible When It Comes to Evan Spiegelâ: Is a Snap Sale Inevitable?","dek":"Spiegel is a complex character&#8212;even by Silicon Valley standards.

But if he wants to keep Snap independent, heâs running out of time.","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>A couple of weeks ago, I asked a former Snap employee what would happen to the social network. The companyâs stock price, after all, had fallen from $21.22 a share nearly a year earlier to an all-time low of $4.82. Most of the pre-I.P.O. leadership team was gone, and around a dozen senior executives had departed since. User growth had flatlined, and in some instances, declined. And <strong>Evan Spiegel,</strong> the companyâs mercurial C.E.O., remains wary and disdainful of the art of leading a public company. On earnings calls, for instance, he often patronizes investors, if he even talks to them at all. Can Snap survive like this, I wondered? âItâs really hard to kill a company,â the former employee said to me. Then, after a contemplative beat, this person continued, âBut, anything is possible when it comes to Evan Spiegel.â</p>\n<p>The comment wasnât really meant as a slight, but rather a reflection that Spiegel is unpredictable. He is known to change his mind from one minute to the next. And in an industry essentially governed by data-driven decisions, Spiegel often trusts his heuristics. He championed an unpopular redesign based largely on intuition; Spectacles, his unpopular foray into hardware, didnât appear fully considered. As the former employee explained, Spiegel can be as fickle about his viewpoints on people and design ideas as the teenagers who (still) use the Snap platform. And while he spends a tremendous amount of energy recruiting new employees, he doesnât devote nearly as much time to making those employees happy and enticing them to stick around at the company. (Spiegel and Snap declined to comment for this article.)</p>\n<p>Spiegel might seem aloof, but perception matters to him. One current executive at Snap recently told me that Spiegel rarely engages with the media for two reasons. First, he is incredibly private, especially when it comes to the personal relationships he has with his wife, <strong>Miranda Kerr,</strong> and their newborn son, <strong>Hart Spiegel.</strong> Second, Spiegel rarely talks to the press because he realizes he canât control what they say about him. Rather than posting his version of events on rival social-media platforms, he has adopted the strategy of speaking at public forums, to mixed results. Last year, while speaking at a Goldman Sachs Group conference, he described his management style as being âjust below the boil. . . . Like when you heat water, and itâs really fucking hot, but itâs just below the boil.â</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, he hasnât fully found a way to amplify one of the things that Snap really has gotten right. In an era where our digital identity has begun to truly affect our mental and physical health, Spiegel values morality beyond sheer growth at any cost. When it comes to the role Snap plays on the Internet, Snap doesnât get half the credit it deserves.</p>\n<p>Imagine for a moment that someone told you <strong>Mike Tyson</strong> hated boxing. Or that Julia Child was disgusted by gourmet food. Or that <strong>Stephen King</strong> and <strong>J.K. Rowling</strong> absolutely despised books and the publishing industry. Doesnât add up, right? Yet Spiegel feels that way about social media. For years, people close to Spiegel have told me that he views the medium as sinister, and believes that sites like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter are bad for society. According to two former Snap executives, this viewpoint informed Spiegelâs decision to not publish usersâ follower counts on the platform. In short, Spiegel believes that such metrics inappropriately inflate egos, demoralize, and offer pernicious social incentives for his psychologically fragile base&#8212;teenagers. Itâs why there is no way to see how many likes, shares, hearts, or hugs, whatever you want to call them, a video or photo received. When the âStreaksâ feature was introduced, the company had no idea how addictive it would end up becoming. Rather than add more similar features to ramp up user growth, Spiegel decided to strip the addictive feature out of the app.</p>\n<p>For a long time, the C.E.O. of Snap kept these feelings to himself. But late last year, Spiegel told <strong>Andrew Ross Sorkin</strong> at <em>The New York Times</em>âs DealBook conference, âWhat people are experiencing on Instagram is, they donât feel good about themselves. It feels terrible, they have to compete for popularity.â Part of Spiegelâs legend in Silicon Valley is premised around the fact that he famously rebuffed <strong>Mark Zuckerbergâs</strong> takeover attempt. In retrospect, itâs possible that he was on to Facebook far earlier than the rest of us. One former Snap executive said that Spiegel thinks Facebook is a detriment to society. Spiegel once said to an executive at his company that what Facebook and Instagram does, âis great for the company and bad for users.â And to his credit, while Facebook, and Twitter executives have been called up before Congress, and are accused of destroying democracy, Snap has not been on the receiving end of regulatory threats or anything to do with <strong>Donald J. Trump.</strong></p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>But while Spiegel might despise Facebook and Instagram for, as he likes to say, âapingâ his design ideas, he has no problem running his company with similar autocratic style. When Snap went public in 2018, Spiegel and his co-founder, <strong>Bobby Murphy,</strong> retained control of the vast majority of voting rights by splitting the companyâs shares into three tiers. Normal stockholders receive Class A shares, which offer no voting rights and therefore cannot help set the companyâs agenda. Class B stockholders, a group largely comprised of company executives and early Snap investors, get one vote per share. Class C stockholders, on the other hand, receive 10 votes per share. This family office-like organization structure has become popular at founder-driven companies in Silicon Valley. Zuckerberg, of course, set up Facebook in a similar manner.</p>\n<p>This structure reinforces a tendency that Spiegel shares with a number of his wunderkind peers. In short, being a world-class founder is a mindfuck. Like others before him, Spiegel spent years refusing to submit to naysayers who told him that his idea wouldnât amount to anything&#8212;he blew past detractors, critics, wisemen, etcetera, to create a publicly listed company. But the obstinacy born in that experience may have left him unavailable to the critical feedback that any chief executive needs. Maybe he was right to resist calls to sell Snapchat to Facebook for $3 billion. But that doesnât mean he shouldnât be listening this time around.</p>\n<p>Snap has had some good news of late. The company announced the hiring of a new C.B.O., C.S.O., and C.C.O., including <strong>Jeremi Gorman,</strong> a former Amazon executive. 186 million people still use Snapchat every day, and they do so for 30 minutes. And last quarter, revenue grew 43 percent from the same period a year earlier. But still, for Snap, the future is daunting. The companyâs market capitalization is down 80 percent from its I.P.O. On Wednesday, the company announced that its chief financial officer, who had been at the company for only 8 months, was leaving. The U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are looking into allegations by shareholders that Snap misled investors ahead of its initial public offering last year, downplaying its susceptibility to Instagram. User growth is likely going to continue in the opposite direction as Instagram becomes the preferred social network of people who grew up on Snapchat. The Snap Spectacles, which Spiegel still sees as one future leg of the company, have barely sold, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/snap-writes-off-nearly-40-million-spectacles-charges-after-product-flops-2017-11\">leading to a $40 million loss for Snap</a> in 2017.</p>\n<p>Spiegel has publicly said that itâs his âstretchâ goal for Snap to be profitable next year. But investors are going to want to see more than profit if theyâre going to keep buying into the company. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/evan-spiegels-imperious-style-made-snapchat-a-successuntil-users-fled-11545588892\">According</a> to <em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> Federal Bureau of Investigation agents last year âshowed up unannounced on the doorsteps of former employees of Snap to question them about how Snap collected and reported user statistics.â Meanwhile, ex-Snapchat employee <strong>Anthony Pompliano</strong> is suing the company, claiming that it âfalsely misrepresentedâ its growth metrics while recruiting him and that Spiegel mislead investors âin an effort to inflate Snapchatâs valuation.&quot;</p>\n<p>Recently, I asked a former Snap investor how he viewed the companyâs $5 stock. He liked it, he said, not because he believed in the company but rather because he thought it would tempt a suitor. âI think Snap was one of the worst investments you could make, until now,â he said. âBut now it seems that the eventual end result is someone buying it. If that happens, thereâs probably a great upside to the stock right now. You buy at $4 or $5 a share and you could end up getting out at $6 a share. Iâm not saying that it is definitely going to get bought, but a company at this valuation definitely has the possibility of a buyout.â When I asked this person if he believes Snap can turn itself around in new hands and become popular again, the investor said, âIt feels like Snap is on the wrong end of fashion right now. Its core users, if they stay with it, are getting older.â</p>\n<p>Spiegel is a brilliant founder with an intrinsic understanding of what people want from their technology. Instagram is so popular, in part, for stealing his ideas and using Facebookâs muscle to implement them. Spiegel also understands that, in the next five years, the camera will be used to communicate in the same way the keyboard is today. But whatâs also clear is that the way he is running Snap as a public company (âreally fucking hot, but itâs just below the boilâ) isnât working for anyone&#8212;from investors, to employees, to Spiegel himself.</p>\n<p>How does it all play out? Itâs anyoneâs best guess, but at the DealBook conference, Spiegel was asked if Snap will still be an independent company in five years and he didnât miss a beat in replying, âYes, sir.â He went on to explain that Snap is doing something different to what other social networks do, and that, to him, was more important than anything else. âWe have a real belief in what weâre trying to accomplish, and we believe that itâs fundamentally different from what weâre seeing in the world,â he said. âWe really just want to make sure that we can continue to make that vision real.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Lessons from the âTrump and the Mediaâ <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/everything-i-learned-in-the-university-of-toronto-course-on-donald-trump?inline\">class at University of Toronto</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; An unsparing <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jill-abramson-dishes-about-new-media-and-her-tumultuous-times-years?inline\">look at <em>The New York Times</em></a></p>\n<p>&#8212; A wild mystery <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/the-mystery-of-salvator-mundi?inline\">surrounding the worldâs most expensive painting sold at auction</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; âI come from generations of unfulfilled womenâ <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/glenn-close-golden-globes-the-wife-oscars-interview?inline\">&#8212;Glenn Close</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Jared and Ivankaâs <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-movie-date?inline\">curious movie date</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Social Media","socialTitle":"âAnything Is Possible When It Comes to Evanâ: Is a Snap Sale Inevitable?","socialDescription":"Spiegel is a complex characterâeven by Silicon Valley standards.

Bank Pictures revealed <strong>Claire Foy</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/netflix-the-crown-queen-elizabeth-prince-philip-pay\">earned less for her role</a> on <em>The Crown</em> than co-star <strong>Matt Smith,</strong> the company said, âGoing forward, no one gets paid more than <strong>the Queen.</strong>â Netflix evidently took that advice to heart.</p>\n<p>Speaking at the <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/02/ted-sarandos-the-crown-pay-gap-reveal-made-netflix-revise-approach-to-talent-salaries-1202552759/\">Makers Conference in California</a> this week, Netflix content chief <strong>Ted Sarandos</strong> revealed that last yearâs controversy prompted a review of cast salaries across all the streamerâs productions, both in-house and third-party. âWe were able to find a couple of other ones we were able to adjust,â Sarandos confirmed, without specifying any of the actors or productions with salaries out of alignment.</p>\n<p>It was March of 2018 when Left Bank and <em>Crown</em> executive producer <strong>Suzanne Mackie</strong> confirmed that Smith <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/04/the-crown-matt-smith-claire-foy-wage-gap-prince-philip-queen-elizabeth-ii\">received a higher salary quote</a> for his two-year commitment than co-star Foy, despite her lead billing, added screen time, and the nature of her role as Englandâs Queen. Left Bank reportedly <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5669657/The-Crowns-Claire-Foy-gets-200-000-pay-plug-gender-gap-Matt-Smith.html\">corrected the imbalance</a>&#8212;even as Foy and Smithâs roles would be <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/07/the-crown-olivia-colman-queen-elizabeth-ii-first-look\">taken over by <strong>Olivia Colman</strong> and <strong>Tobias Menzies</strong></a> in Season 3&#8212;amid a wave of parity corrections for <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/04/thandie-newton-westworld-equal-pay-evan-rachel-wood\">other high-profile series</a>, such as HBOâs <em>Westworld.</em></p>\n<p>For his part, Sarandos denied having a hand in Foy and Smithâs pay gap, but was nonetheless inspired to take stock. âI canât comment on her salary, obviously. I wasnât in charge of it,â Sarandos said during the conference. âBut in general there was a disparity. What it did for us was it had us go back and look at all of our productions&#8212;and all of our productions that were being run by third parties&#8212;and make sure that none of those disparities existed.â Sarandos also mentioned adjusting the salary of an unnamed female executive, given her male counterparts had quoted higher histories for the same position.</p>\n<p>The Netflix content head nonetheless deferred to hiring âsenior executives who you trust, who look like the worldâ to keep the companyâs representations of diversity on track, rather than committing to any one initiative. âItâs in practice, it isnât a plaque we hang on the wall,â Sarandos said of lessons learned from the <em>Crown</em> scandal. âItâs something that we do every day. I think that the Claire-Matt issue, as complicated as it is, pointed to a bigger problem throughout the industry.â</p>","rubric":"Streaming Salaries","socialTitle":"The Crown Gender-Pay Gap Made

Landgraf, who gained a reputation as a television-industry sage after warning the industry about the coming glut of scripted content (a phenomenon also known as <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/netflix-john-landgraf-peak-tv-diversity\">âpeak TVâ</a>), immediately went on the offensive against Netflix in particular, accusing the streamer of playing an unfair game in which it self-reports ratings while refusing to play by the Nielsen metrics that other networks are bound to.</p>\n<p>Netflix recently proclaimed that <em>You,</em> a series that originally aired on Lifetime before moving to the streaming platform, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/netflix-you-bird-box-viewers-numbers\">was on track to be âwatched by over 40 million member householdsâ</a> in its first four weeks on its new platform&#8212;but Landgraf took issue with that number, saying that the streamer had counted households watching just part of an episode, rather than only considering total viewership per episode. If you applied standard metrics to their data, he claimed, it would look more like eight million viewers per episode&#8212;a respectable number, but not the enormous phenomenon Netflix has reported the show to be.</p>\n<p>âBy reporting their singles as if they were home runs,â Landgraf said, the streamer has misrepresented both the number and the true scale of its hits&#8212;suggesting that it alone has figured out the secret to the TV universe.</p>\n<p>âThe truth will ultimately come out, as it always does,â he quipped.</p>\n<p>In December, FX released a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-peak-tv-fx-2018-report-20181213-story.html\">report</a> suggesting that for the first time, streamers are churning out more original content than broadcast and cable networks: 160 scripted original series ran on streaming services last year (not counting reality shows or kids programs), compared to 146 on broadcast networks and 144 on basic cable. During this panel, Landgraf also noted that FX is âlaser-focusedâ on quality rather than quantity. He pointed out that FX (which expects to become part of Disney following Disneyâs acquisition of major Fox assets) saw 13 of its 14 original scripted series appear on 2018 year-end best lists compiled by critics&#8212;a much higher batting average than competitors like HBO, which saw 20 out of its 70 series represented, or Netflix, which had 62 out of 530 originals on those lists, per FX.</p>\n<p>Landgraf proclaimed again that having a high-quality brand is the best way to cut through the noise of the peak-TV era, especially as streamers proliferate and churn out programming. He also noted, however, that âthe enemy of excellence is time. . . . If you want to get things right, you have to stop sometimes. You have to slow down.â This focus on quality, according to Landgraf, is why FXâs highly anticipated adaptation of <em>Y</em>&#8212;which has finally been ordered to series, with <strong>Diane Lane</strong>  starring&#8212;took longer to come to fruition than some fans had hoped it would. âItâs not an easy adaptation; itâs taken a long time to get it right,â Landgraf said. And though Landgraf critiqued Netflix and the tech industryâs âwinner-takes-allâ attitude, he also noted that he was âreally gratefulâ that FX will soon be part of a powerful streaming platform itself: once Disney acquires Twentieth Century Fox, Disney will hold a 60 percent stake in Hulu.</p>\n<p>This spring, the network will launch <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/fosse-verdon-teaser-trailer-fx-sam-rockwell-michelle-williams\">Fosse/Verdon</a>,</em> a limited series about the creative collaboration and romantic relationship between legendary choreographer and director Bob Fosse (played by <strong>Sam Rockwell</strong>) and Broadway star Gwen Verdon (<strong>Michelle Williams</strong>). The series also boasts mega-talent behind the scenes, including executive producer <strong>Lin-Manuel Miranda,</strong> <em>Hamilton</em> director <strong>Thomas Kail,</strong> <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> playwright <strong>Steven Levenson,</strong> and <em>The Americans</em> show-runner <strong>Joel Fields,</strong> an alum of one of FXâs greatest hits. The network is also premiering <em>What We Do in the Shadows,</em> a half-hour vampire comedy series based on the movie of the same name by co-creators <strong>Jemaine Clement</strong> and <strong>Taika Waititi.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ryan Murphy,</strong> a longtime FX creator who recently decamped to Netflix, may be <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/ryan-murphy-netflix-the-politician-jessica-lange\">luring</a> some of his old FX team over to his new shows&#8212;but Landgraf also promised that his network would host more seasons of both <em>American Horror Story</em> and <em>American Crime Story,</em> though he did admit that a planned season of the latter about Hurricane Katrina, which has had a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/annette-bening-american-crime-story-katrina\">long and torturous production process</a>, is now officially dead.</p>\n<p>Of <em>Crime Story,</em> Landgraf said, âWe have three or four ideas in active development, with writers at work on them. I couldnât tell you which one is likely to be ready first.â (We know, though, that another planned season about <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> and <strong>Monica Lewinsky</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/04/american-crime-story-lewinsky-ryan-murphy\">also been scuttled</a>. And although Murphy has not pitched any ideas for further seasons of <em>Feud</em>&#8212;at least, not since <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/fx-feud-prince-charles-princess-diana\">ditching his <strong>Prince Charles</strong> and Diana-themed season</a>&#8212;Landgraf said, âI wouldnât be surprised if I get a call about another cycle.â</p>","rubric":"TCA","socialTitle":"FX C.E.O.

A long-shot bid for relevancy may offer hope&#8212;or presage the final act of a company past its prime.","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>In a 2016 profile of Snapchat co-founder <strong>Evan Spiegel,</strong> Benchmarkâs <strong>Mitch Lasky,</strong> a member of the companyâs board at the time, described the fledgeling C.E.O. in a way that would turn out to be oddly prescient. âOne of the companyâs great attributes is their willingness to put out a lot of product,â he told <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2016/5/9/11594144/evan-spiegel-snapchat\">Recode</a>. âEvanâs got a lot of interesting ideas, and heâs absolutely fearless about putting them out there. If they donât work, so be it.â That was before Lasky stepped down from the board, and before Snapchat parent company Snapâs stock price took a nosedive following its much-hyped I.P.O. Two years later, a series of reports has emerged that suggest Spiegelâs âfearlessâ attitude&#8212;once likened to that of <strong>Mark Zuckerberg,</strong> Steve Jobs, and even Picasso&#8212;may be whatâs sent his company into a veritable tailspin.</p>\n<p>The most recent bad press arrives via <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/snaps-spiegel-flies-high-above-wall-street-worries\">The Information</a>, which on Monday depicted Spiegel as arrogant and detached. According to the outlet, Spiegel spent board meetings on his phone, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/snaps-spiegel-flies-high-above-wall-street-worries\">messaging people on Snapchat</a>. He was often âdismissiveâ of Lasky, people familiar with their conversations said. According to one source, while Lasky had advised Spiegel to consider Wall Streetâs expectations, Spiegel preferred to focus on the companyâs âlong-term strategy.â Per the source, his attitude toward Wall Street was essentially, âfuck the markets.â</p>\n<p>Spiegelâs hubris reportedly colored not only his relationship with the Snap board, but also with his employees. In August, Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-08-22/nobody-trusts-facebook-twitter-is-a-hot-mess-what-is-snap-s-evan-spiegel-doing\">reported</a> that Snap executives were well aware of Instagramâs potential to threaten Snapchatâs growth&#8212;an investor risk that wasnât disclosed during Snapâs I.P.O., prompting <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/snapchat-is-doing-so-badly-the-feds-are-getting-involved\">investigations</a> by the Justice Department and the S.E.C.&#8212;but that Spiegel ignored their warnings. (Snap pushed back on this narrative, saying Spiegel had warned of competition from Instagram.) âNo exec challenges Evan,â a former Snap employee <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-08-22/nobody-trusts-facebook-twitter-is-a-hot-mess-what-is-snap-s-evan-spiegel-doing\">told Bloomberg</a>. âNo exec who lasts over a month, anyway.â</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>The myth of the founder is still powerful in Silicon Valley, especially at Snap, where Spiegel maintains singular creative control. Spiegel, after all, has a compelling vision for the company, at least in the abstract. He was the first to identify a gap in the social-media market for private, lo-fi messaging, and created a product to support an entirely new, visual medium. But Snapchatâs greatest innovation&#8212;Stories&#8212;were not  irreproducible. And so when Instagram copied Spiegelâs platform, the 28-year-old billionaire tried to double down on his original insight by taking Snapchat into the physical world with smartglasses.</p>\n<p>âSpectaclesâ were a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/evan-spiegel-is-doubling-down-on-snapchats-biggest-failure\">failure</a>, but Spiegel, perhaps otherwise out of tricks, is pushing on. On Tuesday, Cheddar <a href=\"https://cheddar.com/videos/snap-new-spectacles-two-cameras-2018\">reported</a> that the company is in the process of creating a new version of its Spectacles, which will feature two cameras and retail at $350. The product reportedly intends to fulfill Spiegelâs vision of overlaying virtual objects onto the real world via augmented-reality lenses, and creating 3-D-like photo effects.</p>\n<p>Whether there is an actual hunger for a third generation of Spectacles remains to be seen. The first version of the product, a pair of glasses that could record video, was an undeniable flop. The company misinterpreted early buzz around Spectacles (which Snap purposely restricted to surprise pop-up markets) as demand, and subsequently lost <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/7/16620718/snapchat-spectacles-40-million-lost-failure-unsold-inventory\">$40 million</a> on unsold inventory. Following the flub, <strong>Steve Horowitz,</strong> who ran Snapâs hardware efforts at the time, was replaced by <strong>Mark Randall.</strong> Under Randall, the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/26/snapchat-spectacles-2/\">launched</a> a second version of Spectacles that retailed for $150, after failing to partner with an eyeglass company like Luxottica or Warby Parker. (Randall <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/snap-hardware-vp-out-1202882421/\">left</a> his post in July.)</p>\n<p>Even as it throws resources behind hardware development, the companyâs more existential problems show no sign of abating. As of last month, its number of daily active users <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/will-jeff-bezos-bail-out-snapchat-earnings-call\">had fallen</a> to 186 million, and executives predicted another drop in the fourth quarter; part of the drop-off is thanks to a widely loathed redesign. The company has also suffered something of a brain drain, losing its chief strategy officer, <strong>Imran Khan,</strong> who one insider <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/another-snap-exec-heads-for-the-exits-as-stock-sinks-to-a-new-low\">called</a> âintegral to everything,â and its vice president of content, <strong>Nick Bell,</strong> in just the past two months. At least half a dozen other executives have also departed, and according to a recent survey, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/snap-employees-look-for-a-way-out-before-the-walls-cave-in\">40 percent</a> of Snap&#39;s 3,000-some staffers are planning to leave the company.</p>\n<p>Some at Snap, including Spiegel, reportedly have their hopes pinned on another product to revive their prospects: an Android redesign. Android users make up a majority of the global smartphone market, and as Spiegel said in his remarks during Snapâs last earnings call, represent âa global growth opportunity for us.â (The new app, he added, is âlightweight, modular, and performant.â) In theory, then, a third version of Spectacles should be relatively low on the priority list. And yet, a source told Cheddar that Spiegel âis planning to develop future iterations of Spectacles for years to come,â having âcreated a plan to lose money on its hardware efforts until reaching break-even in 2020.â The emphasis is deliberate: âFive years from now, I think people are going to be using the camera in ways that they canât even imagine todayã¼in a way that makes as essential a tool as your phone is,â Spiegel said at a recent <em>New York Times</em> DealBook conference. The question is whether Snapchat, itself, will still be around then to bear witness to the revolution it started.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; âWho gets to live in Victimville?â Why Monica Lewinsky decided to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/the-clinton-affair-documentary-monica-lewinsky?mbid=inline\">relive her past</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; How millennial women flexed their political power <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/millennial-women-political-power-midterms-survey?mbid=inline\">during the midterms</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why Democrats already have a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/are-the-democrats-going-to-overthink-themselves-out-of-2020?mbid=inline\">2020 problem</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Whatâs next for <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/magnitsky-sanctions-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi?mbid=inline\">Saudi diplomacy?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Snapchat is doing so badly, the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/snapchat-is-doing-so-badly-the-feds-are-getting-involved?mbid=inline\">feds are getting involved</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Snap","socialTitle":"Does Evan Spiegel Know Where Snapchat Is Going?","socialDescription":"Spiegel, once praised as a visionary leader, appears directionless as investors abandon Snap.

In short order, Zuckerberg began to do just that, mercilessly copying Snapâs features with remarkable success: in June, Instagram <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/28/instagram-stories-daily-active-users-double-snapchats.html\">announced</a> its Stories feature had attracted 400 million daily users, while Snapâs number of daily active users hovered around 191 million in the first quarter of 2018. Reports <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-08-22/nobody-trusts-facebook-twitter-is-a-hot-mess-what-is-snap-s-evan-spiegel-doing\">have suggested</a> that those within Snapchat were well aware of Instagramâs potential to eat their lunch. But whether Snap disclosed the extent of these concerns to investors is now a matter of interest to the U.S. government.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-snap-sec-exclusive/exclusive-snap-reveals-u-s-subpoenas-on-ipo-disclosures-idUSKCN1NJ04O\">reported</a> that both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice have subpoenaed Snap over allegations that it misled investors by not revealing Instagramâs potential to hurt Snapchatâs growth. âIt is our understanding that these regulators are investigating issues related to the previously disclosed allegations asserted in the class action about our I.P.O. disclosures,â the company <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-14/snap-says-doj-and-sec-are-investigating-ipo-disclosures\">said</a> in a statement. âWhile we do not have complete visibility into these investigations, our understanding is that the D.O.J. is likely focused on I.P.O. disclosures relating to competition from Instagram.â Itâs unclear what triggered the S.E.C. and D.O.J. requests, but last week the government made a sealed filing in a shareholder lawsuit in federal court in Los Angeles, in which investors allege that before going public, Snap downplayed the risk of competition from Facebook.</p>\n<p>The suit also alleges that Snap failed to disclose a sealed whistleblower lawsuit from before its I.P.O., in which a former employee claimed Snap had misrepresented its daily-active-user numbers. The company has denied both allegations, saying in a statement, âWe continue to believe the class actionâs claims are meritless and our I.P.O. disclosures were accurate and complete.â In April, a federal court ordered the whistleblower case to arbitration, and in June, a judge denied Snapâs motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The company says it will continue cooperating with both the Department of Justice and the S.E.C. Snap shares tumbled on the news: on Tuesday, they closed at $6.71, and on Wednesday they hovered around $6.60.</p>\n<p>The twin D.O.J. and S.E.C. probes are the latest data points in what looks to be a downward spiral for Snap, which has seen its user growth slacken dramatically in the past year and a half, despite narrowing losses and recording higher-than-expected sales growth. The company is also facing something of an executive exodus&#8212;earlier this week, its V.P. of content, <strong>Nick Bell,</strong> <a href=\"https://cheddar.com/videos/snap-vp-content-nick-bell-to-leave\">parted ways</a> with the company as part of a âplanned reorganizationâ of its content team. Employees, too, are looking for an out: according to a recent survey, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/snap-employees-look-for-a-way-out-before-the-walls-cave-in\">40 percent</a> of Snapâs 3,000-odd staffers indicated theyâre planning to jump ship. Whether or not the government probes have merit remains to be seen&#8212;in August, several people âfamiliar with Snapâs operationsâ told <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-08-22/nobody-trusts-facebook-twitter-is-a-hot-mess-what-is-snap-s-evan-spiegel-doing\">Bloomberg</a> that Spiegel had ârefused to believe that [Instagram tories were] contributing to a slowdown in growth,â but the company has disputed this narrative, pointing to both its I.P.O. prospectus and the fact that Spiegel has discussed competition from Instagram in the past. Either way, another strike against Snap in the eyes of investors could not come at a worse time for the foundering company.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; After

The studio had acquired the rights to Marvel Comicsâ most popular and profitable superhero in 1999, turning that $7 million deal into a groundbreaking, <strong>Sam Raimi</strong>-directed, <strong>Tobey Maguire</strong>-starring trilogy that set new standards for blockbuster earnings&#8212;and ushered in a new era of box-office-dominating superheroes. But by November 2014, both Sony and its chief <strong>Amy Pascal</strong>&#8212;the woman who helped broker that original deal&#8212;were stymied, thanks to the underwhelming critical and fan reaction to <em>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</em> (starring <strong>Andrew Garfield</strong> and <strong>Emma Stone</strong>).</p>\n<p>Then came another blow: a company-wide <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/sony-hacking-seth-rogen-evan-goldberg\">hack</a> that exposed secrets, personal communications, and film concepts still in their infancy to a public eager to mock. Future Spider-plans quickly unraveled, and Pascal was soon out of a job&#8212;though she did manage to keep Spider-Man in her stable as she transitioned into producing.</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to her, Spider-Manâs salvation was making its debut just a few weeks before the hack. <strong>Dan Slottâs</strong> <em><a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/45808/the_amazing_spider-man_2014_9\">Spider-Verse</a></em> comic-book story line hit the stands that year, blowing open the possibilities for an endless roster of super-powered web-slingers&#8212;and eventually helping to inspire the studioâs latest superhero adventure: <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.</em> Between that filmâs mounting Oscar buzz, the commercial and critical triumph of <em>Spider-Man: Homecoming,</em> and a massive box-office coup for <strong>Tom Hardyâs</strong> live-action <em>Venom</em>&#8212;Spider-Man, Sony, and Pascal are now back on top. So, where will they swing next?</p>\n<p>âThereâs a world in which everything comes together,âÂ Pascal said over the phone last Friday night. âBut thatâs not something we can talk about yet.â</p>\n<p>Itâs impossible to tell the story of Spider-Manâs new era without mentioning another big change. As the 2014 Sony e-mail hack revealed, Marvel Studios chief <strong>Kevin Feige</strong>&#8212;who once worked with Pascal on <strong>Sam Raimiâs</strong> <em>Spider-Man</em>&#8212;had been gently sniffing around to see if he might broker a deal to bring Peter Parker into Disneyâs wildly successful Marvel Cinematic Universe. Pascal was <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-black-panther-movie-deal-that-didnt-get-made-1518703200\">reportedly</a> reluctant to relinquish her baby; the deal was so unstable that <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> screenwriters <strong>Christopher Markus</strong> and <strong>Stephen McFeely</strong> had to <a href=\"https://creativescreenwriting.com/the-biggest-superhero-brawl-in-blockbuster-history-captain-america-civil-war/\">leave a blank space</a> in their screenplay, at Feigeâs instruction, just in <em>case</em> Spider-Man ended up coming home.</p>\n<p>By February 2015, it was finally official: Marvel and Sony had brokered a complicated joint-custody deal that would use the Avengers to launch <strong>Tom Hollandâs</strong> younger, more earnest take on Parker in three M.C.U. films. Holland would also star in a trilogy of films co-produced by Marvel Studios and Sony, with <strong>Robert Downey Jr.âs</strong> Tony Stark dropping by to give the new franchise a star-powered boost. The deal was a smashing success; Holland swiftly became the emotional core of the decade-in-the-making <em>Avengers: Infinity War,</em> and Sony used the success of Hollandâs debut to make further plans.</p>\n<p>But Marvel and Sonyâs Spider-Man deal is densely complicated, and restricts what Sony can do with the live-action Spider-Verse. Animation, however, is a different story.</p>\n<p>Even before the hack and the Marvel deal changed the game, Sony and Pascal were eager to team up once more with <strong>Phil Lord</strong> and <strong>Chris Miller,</strong> who got their start working with Pascal on films like <em>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</em> and <em>21 Jump Street.</em> The studio offered them the animated Spider-Man project and, in turn, the pair pitched Sony a story centered on the first black Spider-Man (technically half-black, half-Latino), Miles Morales&#8212;a relatively new comic-book creation, inspired, in part, by actor <strong>Donald Glover</strong> and the fan-driven campaign to have him play the role that eventually went to <strong>Andrew Garfield</strong> in the second live-action Spider-series.</p>\n<p>Lord and Miller said they came up with the idea of having an older Peter Parker mentor Miles on their own&#8212;but when they discovered Slottâs <em>Spider-Verse,</em> they were inspired to add several more Spider-People to the mix. âWe lucked out,â Lord said. âSomeone had done the work for us.â</p>\n<p>Though Lord has the main screenwriting credit on <em>Into the Spider-Verse,</em> he insists the process was a fluid and collaborative one involving Miller, other producers, comic-book writers, and the filmâs three directors: <strong>Peter Ramsey, Bob Persichetti,</strong> and <strong>Rodney Rothman.</strong> Much of the film took shape over a long text message chain between the directors and producers. Jokes were scribbled last minute on Post-its, or simply tried on the fly at the microphone. The script writing wasnât finished until just a few weeks before the premiere.</p>\n<p>Pascal, for her part, said the smartest thing she did was keep quiet and out of their way. Though Lord and Millerâs loose, improvisational style caused a much-publicized rift with Lucasfilm&#8212;who very publicly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/solo-a-star-wars-story-production-lord-and-miller\">fired them</a> from the Han Solo origin story <em>Solo</em> in 2017&#8212;it was perfectly suited to the world of animation, where experimentation and alt-takes arenât nearly so costly.</p>\n<p>The resulting screenplay is not only a riot, itâs exceedingly useful for Sonyâs future franchising plans. Drawing from Slottâs story line, in which multiple Spider-powered characters from different dimensions team up to combat evil, <em>Into the Spider-Verse</em> opens up a galaxy of possibilities&#8212;and unshackles Sony from the continuity concerns that can <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/the-flash-delayed-justice-league-dc-films-state-of\">weigh down other massive superhero endeavors</a>. Sonyâs licensing deal with Marvel includes rights to <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/film/news/whats-next-for-the-spider-man-universe-after-venom-exclusive-1202900203\">roughly 900 characters</a>&#8212;and Pascal sounded downright giddy when she spoke about the potential for âall kinds of stories and worlds that can happen simultaneously.â</p>\n<p>Thereâs still some caution around flooding the market with Spider-People; Lord considered crowding as many as 10 more of them into <em>Spider-Verse,</em> but ultimately nixed the idea so that Milesâs origin story wasnât diluted. Then again, each of the Spider-People who do join Miles&#8212;Peter Parker, Spider-Gwen, Spider-Noir, Spider-Ham, and Peni Parker&#8212;are also primed to potentially lead their own standalone Spider-Universe project, broadening the franchise across age, gender, and global brackets in the process. Peni Parker could easily launch an all-anime Spider-movie; Spider-Noir could get his own moody, black-and-white production. The producers are especially thrilled by the spin-off potential of <strong>John Mulaneyâs</strong> Looney Tunes&#8211;esque Spider-Ham: âOf course! You can imagine how much the kids love that character,âÂ Pascal explained. âYeah,â longtime Spider-Man producer <strong>Avi Arad</strong> added. âWe want piggy.â</p>\n<p>First, though, one of Pascalâs favorites, Gwen Stacy, will lead the way. The producer revealed that Sonyâs <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/spider-man-spider-verse-sequel-spinoff-works-sony-1164210\">upcoming</a> <em>Into the Spider-Verse</em> sequel, directed by <strong>Joaquim Dos Santos</strong> (<em>Avatar: The Last Airbender, Voltron</em>) and written by <strong>David Callaham</strong> (<em>Wonder Woman 1984, Zombieland 2</em>), will be focused on Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy&#8212;and will explore a romance between the two, a thread from Lordâs original script that ultimately didnât fit in <em>Into the Spider-Verse.</em></p>\n<p>Spider-Gwenâs transformation from love interest to friend and hero first may have had something to do with another Gwen Stacy advocate, producer <strong>Christina Steinberg</strong>, joining the Spider team. âI will say that Christina kept us honest,â Lord admits. âAs five boys making a movie, it was really good to have another filmmaker there going, âI don&#39;t think you guys want to do it like this.ââ</p>\n<p>The Gwen and Miles adventure will serve as a launching pad for <em>another</em> Gwen-centric tale: Pascal also confirmed that a previously announced Spider-Women spin-off, written by <strong>Bek Smith,</strong> will feature Spider-Gwen and Cindy Moon (a.k.a. Silk) as well as Jessica Drew (a.k.a. Spider-Woman). Elsewhere at Sony, a live-action <em>Silk</em> film is reportedly already in early development.</p>\n<p>These two new film concepts are taken directly from recent runs of the Marvel comics, part of a wider mandate at Columbia Pictures to stay true to the source material. As Pascal said, âI think itâs great that weâre going to be able to tell movies about female superheroes in this realm, and in the live-action realm as well, because I believe that there are going to be characters that really resonate for people. Theyâre funny and quirky and different, and heroic in all kinds of different ways that only animation allows you to do.â</p>\n<p>Though Pascal and the rest are still waiting to see how <em>Into the Spider-Verse</em> fares at the box office, its awards-friendly buzz&#8212;coupled with the outsized success of <em>Venom</em>&#8212;means that Pascalâs previously shelved plans for Spider-Man could actually come to fruition in the live-action domain as well. <em>Sinister Six,</em> an all-Spider-Man-villain team-up movie based on an old script by <strong>Drew Goddard,</strong> is very much alive in Pascalâs mind: âIâm just waiting for Drew to be ready to direct it. I would do anything with Drew Goddard. Iâm just waiting for him to tell me he wants to,â she said. Goddard himself <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/why-bad-times-at-el-royale-cast-took-pay-cuts-1151419\">seemed game</a> as recently as October.</p>\n<p>2014 whispers about a potential prequel centered on Peter Parkerâs mild-mannered Aunt May were once considered â<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/sony-denies-spider-man-spinoff-starring-young-aunt-may-updated/\">silly</a>â by the studio, and <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/17/aunt-may-spinoff-sally-field_n_6885486.html\">laughed</a> at by <strong>Sally Field,</strong> who played the role in the <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> movies. But four years later, after <strong>Marisa Tomeiâs</strong> young, hip take on the character for Marvel Studios&#8212;and <strong>Lily Tomlinâs</strong> wry animated turn in <em>Into the Spider-Verse</em>&#8212;an Aunt May spin-off suddenly doesnât sound so crazy.</p>\n<p>âYeah, no kidding,âÂ Lord said. âOnce you open up your mind to alternate universes,â Miller added, âand it doesnât have to be canon, then youâre a little more forgiving to try thought experiments that could be fun or interesting. Lily Tomlin did an amazing job&#8212;the idea was that she would be the Q to Spider-Manâs Bond in this universe.â That fresh take was a hit with the Marvel comics crew as well. âLily Tomlinâs voice is now my Aunt May in my head,â said Slott&#8212;who is so reinvigorated by <em>Into the Spider-Verse</em> that he says he wants to start writing Spider-Man comics again.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>When Pascal speaks of the October surprise that was <em>Venom</em>âs <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/venom-box-office-china\">record-breaking box office</a>, she does so with pride, but no sense of ownership. She thinks <em>Venom</em> is âamazingâ and called its marketing campaign âbrilliant,â but Eddie Brock isnât her baby the way Spider-Man is. Columbia Pictures president <strong>Sanford Panitch</strong> is the one overseeing what has been called, internally, Sonyâs Universe of Marvel Characters, or S.U.M.C.</p>\n<p>In fact, Pascal was pretty firm that the animated Spider-Verse and the live-action S.U.M.C. are wholly distinct: âJust look at what the Green Goblin is in <em>Into the Spider-Verse,</em> as opposed to the Green Goblin that we did with Sam Raimi,â she said. Should Sony proceed with both its planned S.U.M.C. Silk film and the animated Spider-Woman team-up Pascal mentioned, the two depictions would be âas different as Doc Ock in <em>Spider-Verse</em> and Doc Ock as <strong>Alfred Molina.</strong>â</p>\n<p>But Dan Slott, who created the character of Silk on the page, pointed out that the animated universe can help the live-action realm, and vice-versa. He sees a world in which an all-female team-up cartoon inspires girls to âhave Silk action figures and Silk t-shirts. You could then turn around and do a Silk live-action movie, because youâve then, on some level, done a world-wide publicity campaign for Silk.â Pascal generally agreed; she said that the animated and live-action Spider franchises simply âmake each other better and bigger.â</p>\n<p>Along with Silk and Venom, the S.U.M.C. has a Morbius project in the works&#8212;starring <strong>Jared Leto</strong> as the titular vampire and frequent Spider-Man nemesis&#8212;and is in the process of developing movies on a wide range of additional heroes, anti-heroes, and villains, like Kraven the Hunter, Jackpot, Nightwatch, Black Cat, Sable, and, if the <em>Venom</em> end of credits are to be believed, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/venom-end-of-credits-who-is-woody-harrelson-carnage-red-hair\">Carnage</a>. Itâs a decidedly mixed bag of characters, and <em>Venom,</em> with its wild swings in tone from slapstick comedy to overly serious body horror, doesnât exactly provide a blueprint of what to expect. Will the S.U.M.C. end up matching the upbeat vibe of both Hollandâs Spider-Man and <em>Into the Spider-Verse</em>? Or is something much grimmer in store?</p>\n<p>For her part, Pascal zeroed in on the moment when the <em>Venom</em> filmâs split personality congealed into a crowd-pleasing hit: âWhen he gets in the tub with all those lobsters in the restaurant, I thought that was a pretty perfect, zany tone.â <em>Venom</em>âs wacky home-video marketing campaign and its post-credits sequence also indicate that Sony knows in the future, it should lighten up. The filmâs PG-13 rating prompted some fans to wonder if the notoriously blood-thirsty Venom has been toned down in order to allow a future team-up with Hollandâs Peter Parker&#8212;something the filmmakers have denied. But if that pairing ever does happen, it would be years in the future, after Hollandâs Marvel contract expires. In fact, the S.U.M.C. moved Brock out of his usual haunts in New York City all the way to San Francisco, presumably, to get him off of Peter Parkerâs turf.</p>\n<p>The bigger question here, then, is what will happen to the Sony-Marvel Studios collaboration when their initial deal expires.</p>\n<p>âI think about crying,â Pascal said of a future in which Spider-Man and Marvel retreat to separate corners. âI can only hope for a future where things work out. I&#39;ve known Kevin since he was Avi&#39;s very, very quiet assistant, who for many years sat in that room listening to us and being so much smarter than any of us without any of us realizing. I will say that working with Marvel has been one of the highlights of my professional career.â</p>\n<p>After the initial custody dispute over Spider-Man, Pascal and Feigeâs working relationship has reportedly been convivial; in fact, Feige gave her thorough, friendly notes and feedback on her earlier Spider-Man films long before Marvel was legally on the hook to do so. And their joint deal has certainly been financially lucrative for both companies. But the union hasnât come without its sticky complications: Sonyâs insistence that Hollandâs second stand-alone film, <em>Far from Home,</em> be released in 2019 threw a wrench in Marvelâs preferred degree of secrecy around <em>Avengers: Endgame,</em> for instance.</p>\n<p>But regardless of whether Feige and Pascal continue to collaborate officially, it seems like the woman who has been watching cinematic Spider-Man grow from his infancy has learned a very valuable lesson from her time with the M.C.U.&#8212;and is the first to acknowledge missteps in the past. The key to the Spider-Verse, she said, is âcharacter and emotion. That is the thing that makes all of Marvel so rich, and thatâs what Stan Lee did&#8212;and I think that is the most important thing is never to forget that, never to get confused that itâs about anything else.â</p>\n<p>Lord, meanwhile, said that this new, animated <em>Spider-Verse</em> âhelps hone in on what the unifying themes of the Spider stories are,â by dint of repeated origins and multiple Spider permutations. Perhaps most crucially, though, it honors Leeâs original vision. As Slott pointed out, just a few years after the Sony hack revealed a narrow definition of what studios thought Spider-Man <em>had</em> to be (<a href=\"https://variety.com/2015/film/news/sony-hack-peter-parker-spider-man-white-straight-1201524150/\">white, straight, male</a>), weâre suddenly in an era where the question has become what <em>canât</em> Spider-Man be: âStan always said that one of the things that was so alluring about Spider-Man for readers was the mask. Anyone could have gotten bitten by the spider, anyone could be under the mask. When you see that character running around, you can associate with it.â And soon, no matter how you identify, Pascal may have a Spider-movie tailored directly to you.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"","socialTitle":"Sony Finally Untangles Its Spider Web","socialDescription":"After a banner year, Amy Pascal looks to the future of the Spider-Verse.","seoTitle":"Sony Finally Untangles Its Spider Web","seoDescription":"After a banner year, Amy Pascal looks to the future of the Spider-Verse.","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Movies","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["spider-man"],"revisionAuthor":"Joanna Robinson","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"interactiveOverride":"","id":"5c0fd6e6f1a5a50e00b02103","revision":159,"createdAt":"December 11, 2018 10:25 am","modifiedAt":"December 14, 2018 9:43 am","revisionCreatedAt":"December 14, 2018 9:43 am","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Hollywood","slug":"hollywood","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fae03af0739cf33e0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Movies","slug":"movies","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120c639a3587939aa6b","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"spider-man","slug":"spider-man","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb8546e1c450b65047d45","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:23 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:23 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:23 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Joanna Robinson is a Hollywood writer covering TV and film for VanityFair.com.

But can they survive Trump?","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><div class=\"callout omfg\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>The night of January 10, 2013, was a triumph for <strong>Ben Shapiro,</strong> his first big score&#8212;but <strong>Jeremy Boreing,</strong> the Hollywood producer whoâs the architect of Shapiroâs vertiginous rise, couldnât get past the wardrobe.</p>\n<p>Dressed in a dark junior-banker suit, with his College Republican flop dangling over his forehead, Shapiro, then the editor at large at Breitbart News, had been booked on <em>Piers Morgan Tonight</em> to discuss his new book, <em>Bullies: How the Leftâs Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America,</em> and to debate gun control. But Shapiroâs tactics revealed themselves shortly after the break, when he called out Morgan for âstanding on the graves of the children of Sandy Hookâ in order to criticize gun owners. âHonestly, Piers,â Shapiro said, âyouâve kind of been a bully on this issue.â He continued, âYou tend to demonize people who differ from you politically.â At one point, he handed Morgan a pocket Constitution to educate him on the Second Amendment. Shapiro was both smart (he has a degree from Harvard Law) and obnoxious (he once described Palestinians as living in âopen sewageâ), snotty and fearless, and he displayed a preternatural talent for getting under the skin of gibbering libs. Fourteen minutes, and millions of views later, Shapiro had accomplished his goal: heâd gone viral.</p>\n<p>As he watched the Morgan hit, Boreing realized that Shapiroâs look, while perfectly adequate for a right-wing think-tank talking head, wasnât going to cut it in many of the demographics they wanted to conquer. Shapiro quickly agreed to revise the right-wing-dork look, and the makeover began: Boreing and a wardrobe stylist emptied Shapiroâs closet almost completely, took him to Macyâs to re-stock, gave him an objectively better haircut, replaced his personal trainer, and presto, the Ben Shapiro look emerged&#8212;a decently-fitted button-up shirt in neutral blues and grays, tucked into better-fitting jeans, and a jacket that didnât look <em>too</em> expensive. He wasn&#39;t exactly a <em>GQ</em> cover subject, but he was, quite crucially, no longer an Alex P. Keaton stereotype. âYou can only be good at so many things. Ben is good at a great many things. This is not one of them,â said Boreing. âSo, we structure it for him and simplify it for him. Thatâs why he always looks like Ben.â</p>\n<p>Before Shapiro, Boreing was a fairly obscure Hollywood figure, perhaps best known for helping to produce <em>Etienne!,</em> a buddy movie about a dying dwarf hamster. His primary political affiliation was as the managing director of Friends of Abe, a quasi-secretive salon of conservative entertainment-industry professionals, which he had taken over from <em>Forrest Gump</em> actor <strong>Gary Sinise.</strong> Years earlier, Andrew Breitbart, a celebrity in his own right within Friends of Abe, had introduced him to Shapiro, and they became fast friends, both serving time at Truth Revolt, a now-defunct Web site, started as the rightâs answer to <strong>David Brockâs</strong> Media Matters, which churned out reliable content attacking the mainstream media and their secret funders. Truth Revolt placated its ancient donors at the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a nonprofit condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center, but it was far too earnest, and barely made a ripple.</p>\n<p>Months before the <strong>Piers Morgan</strong> interview, Boreing and Shapiro had devised a site that would eventually become the Daily Wire, which they viewed as a next-gen media company representing the 21st-century right&#8212;an heir to Drudge and Breitbart, supercharged with modern-media hood ornaments, like podcasts and video, which happened to be Boreingâs specialty. To get attention, they needed personality: someone to put forward their attacks, and someone who could withstand <em>being</em> attacked, too. After the Morgan hit, it dawned on both that Shapiro had to become the brand. ââYou being a <em>brand</em> brings a lot of security. . . . You being a <em>front man</em> gives us a ton of security,â Boreing recalled telling him. âI can better accomplish that with video. I can expose a lot more people to you with video, I can expose them to you in a way that theyâll remember, because people are visual. . . . Let me make you famous and weâll have a much louder voice and a much bigger platform to advance our interests.â</p>\n<p>Shapiro, who began his career in radio production working around <strong>Michael Savage</strong> and <strong>Laura Ingraham,</strong> recognized this reality, too. âPeople love Michael, and they love Laura, because they love Michael and they love Laura, not because they love what Michael and Laura are talking about,â he said, calling Boreing a âgeniusâ for realizing this, long before the influencer genre had taken over pop culture. âFor me, the ideas had always been paramount, and so itâs still bewildering to me that people want to engage with people rather than ideas, but thatâs why I try and kind of use my platform to push ideas as much as I possibly can, or debate ideas.â Of course, the emphasis on debate and ideas eventually became a crucial part of the Ben Shapiro brand, itself.</p>\n<p>Five years later, Shapiro and Boreing, now the Daily Wireâs chief content officer and the âgod-kingâ of the site (as the staffers call him), have become dominant players in right-wing digital media, and the Daily Wire has become an industry leader. Initially funded by fracking magnate <strong>Farris Wilks,</strong> the company has not had to seek any outside backers, according to Boreing, and became cash-flow positive within 14 months&#8212;10 months ahead of schedule. Boreing says the company now boasts 140 million page views a month; more than a million downloads per episode of <em>The Ben Shapiro Show</em> (the ninth-most downloaded podcast on iTunes in 2018, worldwide); sixty full-time employees, with plans to bring on more; 1.1 million subscribers on YouTube and over 400,000 on Shapiroâs personal page. And all in the span of three years, frequently beating several of the longer-established news sites on the right in terms of traffic (The Daily Caller, and video and podcast engagement (Breitbart, which has virtually no YouTube or podcasting presence). âThe <em>quality</em> of the content is, obviously, the passion of the artist. The <em>success</em> of the content is marketing and distribution,â Boreing told me when I visited the Daily Wireâs studios in Sherman Oaks. âYou can raise money and make a film that no one ever sees, or you can raise money and market a film that everyone sees.â</p>\n<p>Shapiro and Boreing arenât the first to turn the culture war into an entertainment product, but they have been among the most successful, in part by avoiding the errors of <strong>Milo Yiannopoulos,</strong> who burned through millions of dollars trying to turn offensiveness into a salable commodity, and <strong>Steve Bannon,</strong> who turned Breitbart into a warship but left it rudderless when he was booted. Instead, Shapiro and Boreing have emphasized Hollywood-style marketing and distribution, prioritizing entertainment value over ideological purity. Shapiroâs heterodoxy hasnât satisfied the culture warriors at Breitbart and the devoted MAGA crowd, who see him as ideologically impure, nor has it endeared him to the anti-Trump left, given his blunt, provocative commentary on race, gender, and academic freedom. (He continues to <a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/12134/anti-science-mainstreaming-mental-illness-ben-shapiro\">argue</a> that transgenderism is a âmental illness.â) He criticizes Trump for his insufficient conservatism nearly as often as he berates mainstream media for overhyping Trumpâs failures.</p>\n<p>And yet, the formula works. Shapiroâs fans are legion&#8212;enough to constitute a political faction of their own. Every time he debates a pundit, student, or high-profile liberal, his fans immediately compile his remarks into YouTube clips. (âBen Shapiro DESTROYS race baiting Congresswoman during Congressional Hearing on Campus Free Speech,â for instance, has over 3.2 million views.) âThe business model is not activism, or even news,â Boreing told Shapiro at the beginning of their venture. âThe business model is personality.â</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>The Daily Wire headquarters in Los Angeles, located on the second floor of a vaguely art deco building in Sherman Oaks, is more reminiscent of a high-end television studio than a dingy online start-up. The lobby is lined with monitors advertising Daily Wire shows, millennials chug La Croix in a well-appointed kitchen, and a full-time makeup artist is always on call. Each of the meticulously designed and personalized sets are stuffed with enough high-end cameras, soundproofing, and lighting equipment to rival the best cable-news studios&#8212;a significant investment for online shows. Currently, the site has four personalities that are promoted regularly: <strong>Andrew Klavan,</strong> an old crank they brought over from Truth Revolt; <strong>Michael Knowles,</strong> a dapper, lib-triggering troll; <strong>Matt Walsh,</strong> a dour, self-described âextremistâ Christian raging against the crassness of pop-culture; and Shapiro himself. Once a month, Boreing hosts a live show in his office&#8212;an elegant man cave featuring studio lighting, a massive cigar humidor, and several overstuffed leather armchairs&#8212;where he, the crew, and a special guest smoke cigars and shoot the shit. Though the studios are Hollywood, the content is decidedly not: in one recent <em>Daily Wire Backstage</em> show, for instance, the hosts discussed Judeo-Christian theology, religious history, and the pathology of the sort of perpetually aggrieved liberal who thinks <em>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</em> is politically incorrect. (The War on Christmas is apparently alive and well in the San Fernando Valley.)</p>\n<p>The location is fitting. Los Angeles is a mostly liberal city, but itâs also become a crucial engine of modern conservatism. Andrew Breitbart got his start there, as did Steve Bannon and <strong>Stephen Miller.</strong> Perhaps itâs something in the water, or a response to the progressive monoculture, or the proximity to Hollywood, but the West Coast conservatives have always had a more tactile understanding of the optics of the culture war&#8212;an instinct for how to weaponize the clash of civilizations, against celebrities, against migrants, against the academics of U.C. Berkeley and the socialists in San Francisco. Instead of burying his ideas in white papers or books or think tanks, Andrew Breitbart made his first Internet project a site called Big Hollywood, devoted to bashing the Beverly Hills elite. Bannon, who eventually took control of Breitbart.com after its founderâs death, cast himself as a filmmaker and yellow-journalism media baron. Neither were intellectuals in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> mold. Miller, who now serves as senior White House policy adviser, developed his reactionary political consciousness at deep-blue Santa Monica High School, where he became <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/02/07/david-horowitz-stephen-miller-a-second-thoughts-warrior/\">closely affiliated</a> with the David Horowitz Freedom Center, an organization initially founded to combat creeping Hollywood liberalism.</p>\n<p>It was in this hostile environment, at the apex of the heady Obama years, that Shapiro and Boreing, both budding culture warriors, were introduced by Breitbart. The two made an unlikely pair: Boreing is evangelical, methodical, contemplative; Shapiro is Orthodox Jewish, bullish, constantly on the attack. And yet, they clicked immediately. <strong>Allen Estrin,</strong> who worked with Boreing at the conservative video-streaming site PragerU, compared them to Roger Ailes and <strong>Bill OâReilly</strong> at the dawn of Fox News: âIf you go to these events . . . any large event with young people, [Ben] is just mobbed. The more common term: heâs a rock star. [And] thatâs Jeremy. Thatâs Jeremy elevating Benâs profile, making sure that Ben makes the right decisions. Thatâs Jeremy guiding him along the best possible path. I donât know where Ben is without Jeremy, but itâs not . . . heâs definitely in a whole different place because of Jeremy.â</p>\n<p>Boreing, a soft-spoken man with mousy hair and modest glasses, is nothing whatsoever like Ben Shapiro. He came to Hollywood from small-town Texas in the early 2000s, worked for a bit as a talent manager, and somehow ended up becoming housemates with <em>Chuck</em> star <strong>Zachary Levi.</strong> âLife was basically getting free food and playing video games in Zachâs dressing room for several years,â he recalled. It was a good life, for sure, but the Texan soon noticed that whenever he parked his car at the <em>Chuck</em> set, his Bush-Cheney bumper sticker was getting some side-eye. âOne day Iâm walking through the stairwell and a very well-known actress, who was one of the stars of that show, stopped me and said, âHey, is that your Bush-Cheney bumper sticker on that pickup in the parking lot?â I said, âYeah. Yes, maâam.â She said, âKid, youâve got balls of steel.â Honest truth, even until that moment it was completely lost on me.â</p>\n<p>At his first Friends of Abe meeting, Boreingâs eyes were opened to the existence of an underground political community for people like himself. It was also there that Boreing met Breitbart&#8212;and where he was exposed to new and intriguing business possibilities. â[Breitbart] got the idea that he should start Big Hollywood and give a voice to whoever in this organization [and] outside of it might want to speak their minds politically,â he said, estimating that when the site was launched in 2008, about 80 percent of its content came from people he met through Friends of Abe. From there came Big Journalism, and from there, Breitbart.com itself, a full-on culture-war engine dedicated to fighting the decline of Western civilization by whatever means necessary. âArguably Breitbart.com wouldnât exist without F.O.A.,â Boreing asserted.</p>\n<p>Back then, within the Hollywood conservative community, there was an ongoing debate over how to win that war&#8212;with art or activism? âMy view is you cannot make a conservative film. You make a good film that obeys craft. And if it reflects good values, then thatâs it,â explained <strong>Lionel Chetwynd,</strong> an Academy Award-nominated screenwriter, director, and founding member of Friends of Abe. (See: <em>Roseanne, Murphy Brown,</em> and Boreingâs film <em>The Arroyo,</em> which focuses on a rancher defending his property against violent illegal migrants in a border town.) On the other side of the argument were those, like Bannon, who primarily saw themselves as propagandists. (See: Bannonâs âdocumentaries,â such as <em>Fire from the Heartland: The Awakening of the Conservative Woman.</em>)</p>\n<p>Breitbart went to the ramparts, having learned from his former colleague <strong>Arianna Huffington</strong> that one could create an influential media empire on the Internet for spare change. Shapiro soon joined him and eventually became editor at large at Breitbart News Network. For a while, Boreing chose the path of the artist, working on films with Levi and focusing on writing, directing, and producing <em>The Arroyo.</em> (âItâs a beautifully constructed movie, and he is a very talented artist,â said Estrin, who taught screenwriting at the American Film Institute.)</p>\n<p>But whenever Shapiro was stuck on something, he would call Boreing, and vice versa, and they eventually started collaborating on video projects. Boreingâs first video in the activist world, which Shapiro hooked him up with, was an animated explainer for Encounter Books debunking global warming. He soon began consulting for PragerU, which packages right-wing social concepts into slick videos. According to Estrin, Boreing came up with the siteâs signature visual style after a photographer came after them with a fair-use claim; their solution was to use illustrations instead. The simple blue and orange stick figures now mark videos with <a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/24752/prageru-videos-surpass-1-billion-views-james-barrett\">more than one billion views</a>, making PragerU one of the most effective conversion tools for young conservatives. At the center of it all was Boreing, who by then had become a leader of the West Coast conservative movement. âWe would always run every major decision past him just to get his insight,â said Estrin.</p>\n<p>Making Ben Shapiro famous would become the duoâs most important project, and their most lucrative. After the post-Piers makeover, they pitched the genesis of the idea for the Daily Wire to <strong>David Horowitz</strong> and the Freedom Centerâs board. They got shot down. But fate provided another pathway. In April 2015, the Freedom Center de-funded Truth Revolt, effectively terminating Boreingâs job, and Shapiro followed him out the door, refusing to work at a hobbled organization. Instead, they kept honing their pitch. Three months later, they secured several million dollars in seed funding from Wilks, the billionaire fracking super-donor who supported <strong>Ted Cruz</strong> in the Republican primaries. The concept for the Daily Wire was not to push a specific agenda&#8212;the traditional nonprofit model, with a board of directors overseeing a political project&#8212;but to build a profit-generating business, combining conservative opinion with news aggregation. They launched the following September with a handful of other Truth Revolt employees, shooting their first few episodes in Boreingâs pool house, before moving to an ad hoc studio on the same floor as PragerU, with sets Boreing and his brother built by hand.</p>\n<p>Shapiro was also working at Breitbart, but by March 2016, he had become fed up with the siteâs slavish devotion to <strong>Donald Trump</strong>&#8212;in particular an ugly episode in which Breitbart mistreated one of its own reporters, <strong>Michelle Fields,</strong> after she was manhandled by Trump campaign manager <strong>Corey Lewandowski</strong>&#8212;and quit his part-time gig to join the Daily Wire full-time, a decision his former colleagues derided as opportunistic. Breitbart <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/03/breitbart-mocking-ben-shapiro-220712\">published and then deleted</a> an article torching Shapiro as an âambitious conservative gadfly, who is known to live on the edge, courting and then leaving a series of companies over the past several years.â Among some portion of MAGA world&#8212;potentially a core audience for a young, conservative media startup&#8212;Shapiro was suspect at best, a traitor at worst.</p>\n<p>The Daily Wireâs Trump-skeptical perspective, under those circumstances, was indeed risky. It was âa very volatile moment in our politics,â Boreing explained, but Shapiro felt strongly about his stance. âI mean, we took the least popular position in the election. We thought the whole thing might be over after Election Night.â Within 14 months, however, Trump had won the presidency and the Daily Wire was cash-flow positive, having won over an unlikely coalition of shell-shocked Republicans and blindsided centrists entranced by the prospect of Shapiro as Trump-era Virgil: a Breitbart exile-turned-Trump critic, who wasnât a foaming-at-the-mouth MAGA nationalist but still delighted in trolling Hillary and Bernie for their alleged transgressions.</p>\n<p>Shapiro had achieved megastardom, even as he oscillated in his opinion of Trump. To his former culture-warrior brethren, Shapiro was trying to have it both ways: pretending to be a populist one day, then trying to stake out a position as a Respectable Conservative the next, and then pissing off everyone by, say, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/1070371276772921344\">tweeting inappropriate comments</a> during George H.W. Bushâs funeral. âHe was hardcore âNever Trumpâ and pretends to be pro-Trump now that itâs clear that going full Never Trump makes you a <strong>[Bill] Kristol</strong> or <strong>[Evan] McMullin,</strong>â an aggrieved conservative writer told me. But of course, neither Kristol nor McMullin are reliably delivering fresh content via multiple platforms to an audience of millions, or frequently cross-promoting with fellow podcast stars <strong>Joe Rogan</strong> and <strong>Dave Rubin</strong> (whose studios are nearby). âItâs never been our philosophy that you succeed in this business by locking up your content. You&#39;ve got to push your content out as widely as possible,â said Boreing.</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5bfdb8388c1abc79da00000a.js?muted=1\"></div></div></section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>For the amount of care and resources poured into video production, the bulk of the siteâs revenue&#8212;and Shapiroâs fame&#8212;derives from his self-titled podcast, which began as an afterthought. The audio was ripped directly from the video show itself, and packaged as an ancillary product when they realized they could start selling ads on it if it hit 30,000 downloads a day. It now gets 1 million downloads per show, and over 1.2 million engagements across platforms, per Shapiro. âIf you look at our original financial specs for what we expected the podcast to do, itâs not even remotely close to what it ended up doing,â Shapiro recalled. The investment in video was worthwhile, though, particularly as they ended up using Facebook Live videos to stream their shows. (Shapiro has 4.5 million followers on Facebook, which he leverages to direct a massive firehose of traffic back to the Daily Wire. Earlier this month, for example, <em>two</em> of the top 10 most-read Facebook stories <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1070437866067673089\">came from Ben Shapiro</a>.)</p>\n<p>The Daily Wireâs success on Facebook is notable, given the frequent criticism on the right that Big Tech firms are stifling their voices. A recent <a href=\"http://go.newswhip.com/rs/647-QQK-704/images/Hyper-Partisan%20Final.pdf\">NewsWhip analysis</a> found that Daily Wire content was in the top 10 of Facebook engagements in political content, frequently cracked the 1,000 most-shared news stories, and was the most actively visited site on the right. Daily Wire authors dominate the top 10 political-authors list, on both the left and right, a statistic which still held when <strong>Nate Silver</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1064656305535807489\">discovered this fact</a> in November. âKinda feels like Facebook has stopped even tryingâ to filter hate speech, he wrote, giving Shapiro an opening to attack him on Twitter, while publishing an <a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/38561/nate-silver-indignant-shapiros-stories-dominate-daily-wire\">op-ed</a> entitled âNate Silver Indignant That Shapiroâs Stories Dominate Facebook. Shapiro Fires Back.â (Author: Daily Wire.)</p>\n<p>But the Daily Wireâs chief growth strategy has always been, and continues to be, Shapiro himself. It helps that he is amenable to becoming a mass-marketed product&#8212;constantly on the road giving talks at universities, making guest appearances on popular podcasts, gabbing his way onto Fox News, scoring speeches at events like CPAC and Politicon, and still, somehow, writing columns for <em>Newsweek, National Review, USA Today,</em> and his own site. There is also his own podcast to attend to, a Sunday interview special, the cigar show, a conventional radio show, and whatever other media platform will have him. After his appearances, the Daily Wire site and podcast tend to see a huge spike in traffic, and more important, audience retention: Shapiroâs first appearance on <em>The Joe Rogan Experience,</em> for instance, provided a massive traffic increase. As a result, the site spends more money promoting Shapiro than the Daily Wire itself&#8212;a decision that ultimately insulates the site from the political whims of Big Techâs dreaded <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/how-evil-is-silicon-valley-podcast\">social-media algorithms</a>.</p>\n<p>Whatever the model is, the rest of conservative media is playing catch-up. Fox Nation, Fox Newsâs own attempt at creating a subscription-only video-content farm for rising personalities, launched earlier this month. Laura Ingraham, from whom Shapiro took career cues, is now moving her radio show online. And in early December, CRTV and the Blaze&#8212;which the Daily Wire had considered buying at one point&#8212;announced a merger, dumping all of their beleaguered writers and resources together for the sake of survival. (Better than being <em>The Weekly Standard,</em> Kristolâs august conservative publication, which is rumored to shutter by the beginning of 2019, having succumbed to changing political tides and plunging print advertising revenues.)</p>\n<p>If Hollywood taught Boreing one thing, however, itâs that fame doesnât last forever. And that goes for politics, too. â<strong>Sarah Palin</strong> was a big voice during the Obama era,â he said as an example. âShe is a much less significant voice during the Trump era. Whatever she represented was connected to that Tea Party moment, and the Tea Party moment didnât survive Trump.â For the Daily Wire and Shapiro, the trick is to keep both brands politically relevant&#8212;a major pressure that Boreing, who said that Shapiro could be the â<strong>Rush Limbaugh</strong> of his generation,â feels acutely.</p>\n<p>âWhat is a one-hit wonder in this space?â Boreing asked, rhetorically. âI think itâs someone who can only survive one presidency. If you find yourself two years into the next presidency, and Ben is still a dominant voice, heâs probably got runway for the rest of his career. . . . So I want to make sure that Ben&#8212;that his fortunes donât rise and fall on this weird moment of the Donald Trump presidency.â</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Conservative Media","socialTitle":"âLet Me Make You Famousâ: How Hollywood Invented Ben Shapiro","socialDescription":"With the shaping of producer Jeremy Boreing, Brand Shapiro has made owning the libs a lucrative business, and the Daily Wire a rising power in conservative media.

Maybe the H.F.P.A. will go for the false-toothed mugging of Malek, or Dafoeâs arty angst. The most tenuous prediction here is probably Hawke, who has won criticsâ prizes but whose quiet, strange film may not snare the H.F.P.A.âs attention. Myriad other actors could take that fifth slot, including <strong>Hugh Jackman</strong> for the largely forgotten <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/review-sex-secrets-and-hugh-jackman-roil-the-nation-in-the-front-runner\">The Front Runner</a></em> or son of Hollywood <strong>Lucas Hedges,</strong> whose <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/review-boy-erased-is-finely-acted-but-familiar\">Boy Erased</a></em> has taken a major status hit since the fall festivals and could use a boost.</p>\n<h2>Best Actress, Motion Picture, Drama</h2>\n<p>Lady Gaga, <em>A Star Is Born</em><br>\nGlenn Close, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/glenn-close-does-oscar-worthy-work-in-the-wife\">The Wife</a></em><br>\nMelissa McCarthy, <em>Can You Ever Forgive Me?</em><br>\nYalitza Aparicio, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/roma-is-alfonso-cuarons-epic-personal-masterpiece\">Roma</a></em><br>\nViola Davis, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/widows-movie-review-viola-davis-steve-mcqueen-gillian-flynn\">Widows</a></em></p>\n<p>The H.F.P.A. has given Lady Gaga <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/01/golden-globes-2016-recap-the-revenant\">an acting award before</a>, for her work on <em>American Horror Story,</em> and it feels like they will again for her revelatory debut film performance. Fox Searchlight has asked that McCarthy compete here rather than against the juggernaut that is <strong>Emily Bluntâs</strong> Mary Poppins, and we wish she had a better shot at the trophy. But barring anything wild&#8212;<strong>Julia Roberts</strong> swooping in and raining <em>Ben Is Back</em> fire on everyone, say&#8212;Gaga is the most likely nominee and victor. We canât say we disagree, even if she is in the wrong category.</p>\n<h2>Best Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy</h2>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/crazy-rich-asians-movie-review\">Crazy Rich Asians</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/wickedly-entertaining-the-favourite-boasts-three-great-performances\">The Favourite</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/green-book-tiff-award-best-picture-race\">Green Book</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/cover-story-the-supercalifragilistic-lin-manuel-miranda\">Mary Poppins Returns</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/vice-trailer-christian-bale-sam-rockwell-cheney-bush\">Vice</a></em></p>\n<p>If early critic whispers are any indication, it seems unlikely that an overwhelming number of people in the H.F.P.A. will <em>love</em> <strong>Adam McKayâs</strong> <strong>Dick Cheney</strong> romp, <em>Vice,</em> which seems destined to garner mixed opinions. But itâs a sure bet for a nomination anyway, given the filmâs subject, cast, and director. Meanwhile, in a world where <em>A Star Is Born</em> and <em>Can You Ever Forgive Me?</em> are considered dramas&#8212;rather than, respectively, a musical and a comedy (albeit an acerbic one)&#8212;thereâs unexpectedly room for the mega-hit <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> to nab a spot on the roster. The other films chosen above all seem like sure bets. No oneâs going to stand in the way of a Disney musical like <em>Mary Poppins Returns;</em> <em>The Favourite</em> is a giddy delight that, in addition to having prestige, is genuinely funny; and <em>Green Book,</em> an audience favorite at the Toronto Film Festival, remains beloved in the industry despite itself.</p>\n<h2>Best Actor, Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy</h2>\n<p>Christian Bale, <em>Vice</em><br>\nSteve Carell, <em>Welcome to Marwen</em><br>\nLin-Manuel Miranda, <em>Mary Poppins Returns</em><br>\nViggo Mortensen, <em>Green Book</em><br>\nRobert Redford, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/robert-redford-the-old-man-and-the-gun-review\">The Old Man &amp; the Gun</a></em></p>\n<p>Three of these guys feel like sure things. Christian Bale is a great actor whose work with Adam McKay has, to date, been superb; <em>Vice</em> should be no different. And too much of the world loves Viggo Mortensen for anyone to be <em>too</em> hung up on <em>Green Book</em>âs retrograde worldview, or the fact that his performance&#8212;in which Mortensen tries his hand at playing an Italian-American driver and muscle man who folds entire pizza pies to eat them whole&#8212;is a little too spaghetti-and-meatballs to match the actorâs best work. The world loves Lin-Manuel Miranda too much for his turn in <em>Mary Poppins</em> to go unnoticed as well, and we would like to think that the same applies to Robert Redfordâs late-career-best work in <em>The Old Man &amp; the Gun.</em> As for that last slot, pundits seem to have an eye on Steve Carel_ (whoâs always better in comedies than drama)&#8212;but weâre holding out for <strong>Lakeith Stanfield</strong> in <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/07/sorry-to-bother-you-review\">Sorry to Bother You,</a></em> or even <strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong> in <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/review-deadpool-2\">Deadpool 2</a></em> instead.</p>\n<h2>Best Actress, Motion Picture, Comedy</h2>\n<p>Emily Blunt, <em>Mary Poppins Returns</em><br>\nOlivia Colman, <em>The Favourite</em><br>\nElsie Fisher, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/01/skate-kitchen-eighth-grade-movie-reviews-sundance-bo-burnham\">Eighth Grade</a></em><br>\nCharlize Theron, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/tully-charlize-theron-diablo-cody-review\">Tully</a></em><br>\nConstance Wu, <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em></p>\n<p>This category seems easy. Emily Blunt, Olivia Colman, and Elsie Fisher are all so lauded. Meanwhile, Charlize Theron is memorable and admirably low-key in <em>Tully,</em> and Constance Wu carries <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> with grace, giving the story the loving warmth it needs to offset its abundance of monied pizzazz.</p>\n<h2>Best Supporting Actor, Motion Picture</h2>\n<p>Mahershala Ali, <em>Green Book</em><br>\nTimothÃ©e Chalamet, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/timothee-chalamet-beautiful-boy-review\">Beautiful Boy</a></em><br>\nAdam Driver, <em>BlacKkKlansman</em><br>\nSam Elliott, <em>A Star Is Born</em><br>\nRichard E. Grant, <em>Can You Ever Forgive Me?</em></p>\n<p>This is the list that many pundits expect to see nominated at the Academy Awards as well&#8212;save, perhaps, for Driver, who gives a great performance in a film whose awards momentum seems to have stalled since summer. But the Globes love off-the-beaten-path nods, as well as broad, crowd-pleasing movies&#8212;which could also mean that reigning Golden Globe supporting-actor winner <strong>Sam Rockwell</strong> will show up here for the eerily on-point <strong>George W. Bush</strong> impression he does in <em>Vice.</em> If <em>The Favourite</em> wins over the Globes with its period flare and outrÃ© content, <strong>Nicholas Hoult</strong>  could sneak in as well. By and large, though, the field seems set&#8212;and like it will reappear when the Oscar noms are revealed.</p>\n<h2>Best Supporting Actress, Motion Picture</h2>\n<p>Amy Adams, <em>Vice</em><br>\nRegina King, <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em><br>\nEmma Stone, <em>The Favourite</em><br>\nRachel Weisz, <em>The Favourite</em><br>\nMichelle Yeoh, <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em></p>\n<p>Perennial Oscar bridesmaid Adams has had better luck at the Globes: seven nominations over the past 10 years, two of which actually resulted in wins. That could make her the front-runner in this category, despite stiff competition from the two <em>Favourites</em> not running in the leading category and from King, who has been racking up awards for her shattering <em>Beale Street</em> performance. Yeoh, we know, is the outlier among these picks&#8212;but in a world where <em>First Man</em> has faded quietly into the background, even Golden Globes golden girl <strong>Claire Foy</strong> seems less likely to go the distance. That leaves a slot open for Yeoh, who exudes a steely warmth in a hit rom-com with international appeal.</p>\n<h2>Best Director, Motion Picture</h2>\n<p>Bradley Cooper, <em>A Star Is Born</em><br>\nAlfonso CuarÃ³n, <em>Roma</em><br>\nPeter Farrelly, <em>Green Book</em><br>\nSpike Lee, <em>BlacKkKlansman</em><br>\nAdam McKay, <em>Vice</em></p>\n<p>Weâre straying a bit from the awards-pundit hegemony here, because the H.F.P.A. might just be basic enough to laud McKay for his messy, cursory indictment of Dick Cheney. They also might ignore the controversy surrounding <em>Green Book</em> in favor of the narrative of a big comedy director, Farrelly, going semi-serious. If the group is less taken with that story, <strong>Damien Chazelle</strong> or <strong>Barry Jenkins</strong> could show up in this category, though <em>First Man</em>âs continually dimming prospects are making things harder for Chazelle. The spoiler weâd love to see? <strong>Ryan Coogler</strong> for <em>Black Panther</em> or Marielle Heller for <em>Can You Ever Forgive Me?</em></p>\n<h2>Best Screenplay, Motion Picture</h2>\n<p><em>The Favourite</em><br>\n<em>First Reformed</em><br>\n<em>Green Book</em><br>\n<em>A Star Is Born</em><br>\n<em>Vice</em></p>\n<p>This feels open-ended, with a few exceptions. <em>Green Book,</em> <em>First Reformed,</em> and <em>The Favourite</em> seem reliable sure-bets for being beloved, respected, and entertaining, respectively. Beyond that, <em>Vice</em> also seems likely for a citation; everyone loves an ambitious political satire. Which might also be what gives <em>BlacKkklansman</em> the edge&#8212;but we suspect the last slot will go to <em>A Star Is Born,</em> which, though itâs the fourth remake of this movie and not <em>so</em> different from the others, is still handsomely conceived and written. Weâd love to see <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em>&#8212;an astonishing James Baldwin adaptation&#8212;get the nod instead, but that filmâs momentum is a little hard to parse.</p>\n<h2>Best TV Series, Drama</h2>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/04/handmaids-tale-season-2-review\">The Handmaidâs Tale</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/04/killing-eve-sandra-oh-interview\">Killing Eve</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/ozark-season-two-isnt-great-but-it-is-good\">Ozark</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/pose-fx-ryan-murphy-review\">Pose</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/succession-hbo-series-review-rupert-murdoch-fox-newscorp\">Succession</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/how-the-cast-of-yellowstone-amused-kevin-costner-in-the-wild-west\">Yellowstone</a></em></p>\n<p><em>Ozark</em> and <em>The Handmaidâs Tale,</em> both in their sophomore seasons, can expect repeat nominations in the drama-series category this year, especially with contenders <em>Stranger Things</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> out of the running for this awards cycle. (<em>This Is Us,</em> which stunned in its first season, seems to have lost most of its buzz.) That being said, with the Hollywood Foreign Press Associationâs historical emphasis on the new and the buzzy, the category could also be a field to honor exciting debuts&#8212;like BBC Americaâs <em>Killing Eve,</em> which the Emmys already recognized by nominating <strong>Sandra Oh,</strong> or HBOâs summer-splash hit <em>Succession,</em> which takes on the dark underbelly of mega-billionaires with nasty flair. Itâs all dependent on what kind of for-your-consideration campaign is going to seduce the voters. Will it be <em>Pose</em>âs sweet retelling of queer life in the 80s, or the doom and gloom of <em>Handmaid Tale</em>âs dystopia? Keep an eye on Paramountâs <em>Yellowstone</em> as well, an unexpected ratings hit starring <strong>Kevin Costner</strong> that is just buzzy enough to catch the eye of a stray voter.</p>\n<h2>Best Actress, TV Series, Drama</h2>\n<p>Elisabeth Moss, <em>The Handmaidâs Tale</em><br>\nJulia Roberts, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/homecoming-amazon-series-creators-interview\">Homecoming</a></em><br>\nKeri Russell, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/the-americans-series-finale-review-season-6-keri-russell-matthew-rhys\">The Americans</a></em><br>\nSandra Oh, <em>Killing Eve</em><br>\nEvan Rachel Wood, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/04/westworld-season-2-review\">Westworld</a></em><br>\nRobin Wright, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/house-of-cards-final-season-review\">House of Cards</a></em></p>\n<p>This is going to be a real mess. Elisabeth Moss, <strong>Caitriona Balfe,</strong> and <strong>Maggie Gyllenhaal</strong> were all nominated last year, and thereâs no particular reason for them to <em>not</em> be nominated again. But theyâre coming up against several stiff contenders&#8212;first and foremost Julia Roberts, whose first foray into television with <em>Homecoming</em> impressed enough viewers that a gold statuette might be imminent. Evan Rachel Wood could very well be nominated for her consistently impressive work in another much-discussed season of <em>Westworld</em> as well. And this fallâs Emmys threw a few more wrenches into the mix: Sandra Ohâs nomination for <em>Killing Eve</em> put her, and the show, on the industryâs radar; and though <strong>Keri Russell</strong> did not win in her category, co-star <strong>Matthew Rhys</strong> did win for the last season of <em>The Americans</em> (and gave a touching tribute to his co-worker and romantic partner onstage). And <em>The Americans</em> isnât the only show with a buzzy final season. <em>House of Cards,</em> too, attempted to erase <strong>Kevin Spacey</strong> by elevating <strong>Robin Wright</strong>&#8212;and though that effort didnât quite work from a plotting perspective, Wright could muscle her way into a nomination. Roberts is probably the shoo-in to win, given how sensitive to stardom the H.F.P.A. is. But Gyllenhaal, Oh, Russell, Newton, and now Moss have nabbed their share of accolades and magazine covers, too. Plus, never doubt the Globesâs ability to come up with a truly bonkers choice&#8212;such as last year, when they nominated <em>13 Reasons Why</em>âs <strong>Katherine Langford.</strong> What about the overlooked <strong>Mandy Moore</strong> for <em>This Is Us,</em> or <strong>Christine Baranski</strong> for <em>The Good Fight</em>? Itâs the Globes: anything could happen.</p>\n<h2>Best Actor, TV Series, Drama</h2>\n<p>Kevin Costner, <em>Yellowstone</em><br>\nJohn Krasinski, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/jack-ryan-amazon-tv-show-review-tom-clancy-john-krasinski\">Jack Ryan</a></em><br>\nBob Odenkirk, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/better-call-saul-season-4-finale-bob-odenkirk\">Better Call Saul</a></em><br>\nMatthew Rhys, <em>The Americans</em><br>\nLiev Schreiber, <em>Ray Donovan</em></p>\n<p>If thereâs one thing we have learned to bet on in this life, it is the Golden Globesâs ongoing love affair with Showtimeâs <em>Ray Donovan.</em> Yes, the show is still running; yes, <strong>Jon Voight</strong> once won an award for it; and yes, last year, <strong>Liev Schrieber</strong> was nominated once again for the titular role of Ray Donovan. We can only assume he will be nominated again. The rest of the category is a bit softer. The Globes were impressed with <em>The Good Doctor</em>âs <strong>Freddie Highmore</strong> last year; they might be similarly entranced by <strong>John Krasinskiâs</strong> fairly solid work in a new interpretation of <em>Tom Clancyâs Jack Ryan.</em> And <em>Yellowstone,</em> on Paramount, has an ace in the hole: Kevin Costner, whose presence made that show an unexpected ratings hit. <strong>Bob Odenkirk</strong> is a favorite for his continued work on <em>Better Call Saul,</em> and Matthew Rhys just won the Emmy for this category, which ought to increase his chances for the Globe, too. The industry has taken a real shine to <strong>Jason Bateman</strong> in <em>Ozark,</em> and given his star power, <em>Westworld</em>âs <strong>Ed Harris</strong> might have the best chance of any of his co-stars to break into the nominees. But all bets are off: <strong>Sterling K. Brown</strong> is still stunning audiences on <em>This Is Us,</em> and <strong>Jeffrey Wright</strong> is, without a doubt, the lynchpin holding <em>Westworld</em> together, which means either of them could snag a nod as well.</p>\n<h2>Best TV Series, Comedy</h2>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/atlanta-season-2-finale\">Atlanta</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/barry-hbo-bill-hader-review\">Barry</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/alan-yang-discusses-his-new-amazon-series-forever-and-possible-plans-for-master-of-none-season-three\">Forever</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/jim-carrey-kidding-showtime-trump-paintings-mr-rogers\">Kidding</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/marvelous-mrs-maisel-season-2-interview-amy-sherman-palladino-dan-palladino\">The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</a></em></p>\n<p>Though the H.F.P.A. adores planting its flag on the exciting and new, itâs hard to imagine a show in this rather lackluster TV year that could outshine last yearâs darling <em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.</em> The showâs second season, which is already garnering warm reviews, will also have the advantage of airing right at the end of the year, making it freshest in the minds of voters. The new kids on the block that might give Midge Maisel a run for her money are Showtimeâs <em>Kidding,</em> Emmy favorite <em>Barry,</em> and the more obscure but critically beloved <em>Forever.</em> (The H.F.P.A. loves obscure.) Itâs difficult to envision a world where <em>Atlanta</em>âs second season gets left out of the conversation, but look out for Netflixâs <em>The Kominsky Method</em> to possibly take the FX darlingâs slot. If thereâs one thing that the H.F.P.A. loves more than new and obscure, itâs Hollywood royalty like <strong>Michael Douglas</strong> and <strong>Alan Arkin.</strong></p>\n<h2>Best Actress, TV Series, Comedy</h2>\n<p>Alison Brie, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/glow-season-2-marc-maron-alison-brie\">GLOW</a></em><br>\nRachel Brosnahan, <em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em><br>\nJennifer Garner, <em>Camping</em><br>\nIssa Rae, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/insecure-season-3-review\">Insecure</a></em><br>\nMaya Rudolph, <em>Forever</em></p>\n<p>Once again, last yearâs winner, <strong>Rachel Brosnahan,</strong> feels like a real lock here&#8212;but this truly is a category where the H.F.P.A. likes to shock and surprise by nominating and honoring someone unexpected and new. (See: last yearâs nomination for <em>SMILF</em> star <strong>Frankie Shaw,</strong> to name but one example.) So while their shows may not have been huge hits, and they may not be new to TV in general, <strong>Jennifer Garner</strong> and <strong>Maya Rudolph</strong> feel like exactly the kind of leading ladies the H.F.P.A. likes to single out. Add two-time nominee <strong>Issa Rae</strong> and <strong>Alison Brie</strong>_&#8212;who gave a much more restrained and compelling performance in <em>GLOW</em> Season 2&#8212;and you have a strong lineup of talented, funny women.</p>\n<h2>Best Actor, TV Series, Comedy</h2>\n<p>Jim Carrey, <em>Kidding</em><br>\nTed Danson, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/the-good-place-season-3-premiere-review\">The Good Place</a></em><br>\nMichael Douglas, <em>The Kominsky Method</em><br>\nDonald Glover, <em>Atlanta</em><br>\nBill Hader, <em>Barry</em></p>\n<p>Much like comedy actress, this category feels like it could easily fall in lock step with the Emmys and give the well-liked, multi-hyphenate <strong>Bill Hader</strong> his due for creating, writing, directing, and starring in <em>Barry.</em> But hereâs where the H.F.P.A. might truly chase after stars and reward <strong>Jim Carrey</strong>_ for his return to TV. Michael Douglas and <strong>Ted Danson</strong> as elder statesmen and institutional favorites also seem a likely bet for this category&#8212;but the H.F.P.A would be most remiss if <strong>Donald Glover</strong> didnât join Hader as another multi-talented, multi-hyphenate leading man.</p>\n<h2>Best Limited Series or TV Movie</h2>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/01/assassination-of-gianni-versace-american-crime-story-season-2-review\">The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/escape-at-dannemora-patricia-arquette-ben-stiller\">Escape at Dannemora</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/how-john-legend-found-jesus-christ-superstar\">Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/maniac-netflix-emma-stone-jonah-hill-review\">Maniac</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/patrick-melrose-benedict-cumberbatch-showtime-miniseries-review\">Patrick Melrose</a></em><br>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/07/sharp-objects-review-amy-adams-gillian-flynn-hbo-limited-series\">Sharp Objects</a></em></p>\n<p>The Golden Globes are where prestigious limited series and made-for-TV movies shine&#8212;and in the Peak-TV era, there are dozens of lush productions to choose from. Showtimeâs <em>Patrick Melrose,</em> starring <strong>Benedict Cumberbatch,</strong> is a good bet&#8212;as is HBOâs star-studded <em>Sharp Objects,</em> led by star <strong>Amy Adams.</strong> Emmy-sweeping <em>The Assassination of Gianni Versace</em> should also be nominated, and might be the shoo-in to win. But this is a tight category. Up against these three: <em>Jesus Christ Superstar,</em> which delivered the live-action musical numbers the Hollywood Foreign Press likes to fall for; Netflixâs beautifully made <em>Maniac,</em> with its A-list stars; and Showtimeâs <em>Escape at Dannemora,</em> which has the added advantage of a well-known star behind the camera, too. We wouldnât put a rogue nomination out of the question in this category, either, given just how crowded the field is: <em>Trust,</em> on FX, with <strong>Brendan Fraser</strong> and <strong>Donald Sutherland,</strong> or <em>Waco,</em> on Paramount, starring <strong>Taylor Kitsch.</strong> And though itâs unlikely, the H.F.P.A. <em>ought</em> to nominate HBOâs stunning film <em>The Tale,</em> which has criminally fallen off the radar in the last few months.</p>\n<h2>Best Actress, Limited Series or TV Movie</h2>\n<p>Amy Adams, <em>Sharp Objects</em><br>\nLaura Dern, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/01/the-tale-jennifer-fox-laura-dern-sundance-review\">The Tale</a></em><br>\nEdie Falco, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/law-and-order-menendez-murders-edie-falco\">Law and Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders</a></em><br>\nRegina King, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/02/seven-seconds-clare-hope-ashitey-interview\">Seven Seconds</a></em><br>\nEmma Stone, <em>Maniac</em></p>\n<p>Emmy winner Regina King should be nominated here, again, for Netflixâs <em>Seven Seconds,</em> but sheâll have stiff competition: awards magnet_Emma Stone, who starred in Netflixâs limited sci-fi series <em>Maniac;</em> Amy Adams, who turned in a career-best performance in <em>Sharp Objects;</em> and titanic talent <strong>Laura Dern,</strong> whose performance in <em>The Tale</em> is a complex portrayal of strength amidst vulnerability. The Hollywood Foreign Press Associationâs affection for big wigs and adventurous star turns might lead them toward another role that the Emmys, too, nominated: <strong>Edie Falco</strong> in <em>Law and Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders,</em> a miniseries nearly instantly forgotten except for Falcoâs magnificent, sprawling perm.</p>\n<h2>Best Actor, Limited Series or TV Movie</h2>\n<p>Darren Criss, <em>The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story</em><br>\nBenedict Cumberbatch, <em>Patrick Melrose</em><br>\nBenicio Del Toro, <em>Escape at Dannemora</em><br>\nHugh Grant, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/hugh-grant-a-very-english-scandal-interview\">A Very English Scandal</a></em><br>\nRichard Madden, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/richard-madden-gets-an-excellent-james-bond-audition-in-bodyguard\">The Bodyguard</a></em></p>\n<p>FXâs <em>Fargo</em> usually provides a contender or two for this category, but with <strong>Noah Hawleyâs</strong> star-studded crime anthology out of the running, look for Emmy winner <strong>Darren Criss</strong> to bring home the statue for FX. There isnât much threatening him by way of competition, but three Brits might do their damndest. <strong>Hugh Grantâs</strong> charmingly louche and venal turn in <em>A Very English Scandal</em> is sure to catch the eyes of votes, as will <strong>Richard Maddenâs</strong> James Bond audition in <em>The Bodyguard.</em> (The BBC/Netflix show was well-regarded here, but an absolute <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/bodyguard-sets-drama-viewing-records-in-the-u-k-ahead-of-netflix-launch-1202989278/\">phenomenon</a> in the U.K.) Finally, Golden Globe favorite Benedict Cumberbatch is likely to get some love for his turn in <em>Patrick Melrose,</em> and itâs hard to imagine the celebrity-obsessed H.F.P.A. passing on the movie star allure of <strong>Benicio Del Toro</strong> in the <strong>Ben Stiller</strong>-directed <em>Escape at Dannemora.</em></p>\n<h2>Best Supporting Actor, TV Series, Limited Series, or TV Movie</h2>\n<p>Alan Arkin, <em>The Kominsky Method</em><br>\nRicky Martin, <em>The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story</em><br>\nTony Shalhoub, <em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em><br>\nBen Whishaw, <em>A Very English Scandal</em><br>\nHenry Winkler, <em>Barry</em></p>\n<p>As the Peak-TV era wears on, itâs increasingly ridiculous for the Globes to squeeze every single non-leading TV actor into the same cramped category&#8212;particularly if the awards continue to insist on selecting just five nominees. Nevertheless, this quintet seems likely to make the cut: reigning Emmy winner Winkler; vulnerable and vengeful Whishaw; Shalhoub, who already has a passel of <em>Monk</em> nods under his belt; and two admittedly left-field choices, from a little-watched Netflix series and an <em>American Crime Story</em> season with less impact than the mighty <strong>O.J. Simpson</strong> story. Still: <em>The Kominsky Method</em> seems like the kind of inside-showbiz story the Globes loves, and honoring <strong>Ricky Martin</strong> over <strong>Edgar Ramirez</strong> is just the sort of kooky thing the Globes would do.</p>\n<h2>Best Supporting Actress , TV Series, Limited Series, or TV Movie</h2>\n<p>Alex Borstein, <em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em><br>\nPatricia Clarkson, <em>Sharp Objects</em><br>\nPenÃ©lope Cruz, <em>The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story</em>\nThandie Newton, <em>Westworld</em><br>\nYvonne Strahovski, <em>The Handmaidâs Tale</em></p>\n<p>The TV supporting-actress field seems a little less overwhelming than supporting actor, and more predictable as well&#8212;perhaps because itâs so clearly <strong>Patricia Clarksonâs</strong> to lose. Nevertheless, Clarkson will most likely be up against these four strong performers, though previous nominee <strong>Ann Dowd</strong> could very well swap places with her fellow Gilead denizen Strahovski. Or the Globes could do something truly bonkers and bring in, say, <strong>Hilary Swank</strong> for <em>Trust</em> instead. With this show, you never really know.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Lady Gaga says Bradley Cooper <a

In a recent <a href=\"https://cheddar.com/videos/snap-employees-eye-exist-as-stock-sinks\">internal survey</a>, as many as 40 percent of Snapâs 3,000-odd staffers said they planned to leave the company&#8212;up from 11 percent in the first quarter, a historic slump in employee morale. Seventy-five percent of Snapâs workforce said theyâre still satisfied with their jobs, per the survey. But the results nonetheless indicate that <strong>Evan Spiegel</strong> could have a burgeoning crisis on his hands. âItâs easy to blame a redesign, a one-time mistake in the past,â <strong>Yih Lee,</strong> a former Snap employee, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MindOfYih/status/1055103714824994818\">tweeted</a> after Cheddar broke the news on Wednesday. âBut at some point, management has to take responsibility for the culture they built, the poor leadership they propped up, and the low morale they ignored.â</p>\n<p>That morale took a beating in March, when Snap fired about 120 engineers, after previously laying off staffers in its hardware and content departments. Its attrition problem has extended to the ranks of company executives, too. In September, <strong>Imran Khan,</strong> Snapâs chief strategy officer, became the latest in a long line of executives to jump ship. Insiders characterized his departure as a huge blow: âYou canât underestimate the importance of Imran to Snapchat,â one person with knowledge of the company <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/another-snap-exec-heads-for-the-exits-as-stock-sinks-to-a-new-low\">told me</a> at the time. Nor was he alone. In May, Chief Financial Officer <strong>Drew Vollero</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/snap-chief-financial-officer-drew-vollero-to-step-down-1525725549\">stepped down</a> to pursue other opportunities, and in July, the companyâs vice president of hardware, <strong>Mark Randall,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17607834/head-snapchat-spectactles-augmented-reality-mark-randall\">left</a> to start his own company. Other departures have included head of sales <strong>Jeff Lucas,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/snaps-head-of-sales-leaving-after-less-than-two-years-1518462104\">reportedly</a> stepped down to âpursue a new challengeâ; <strong>Chris Handman,</strong> the companyâs <a href=\"https://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/07/25/snaps-general-counsel-leaves-company/?slreturn=20180810083156\">first general counsel</a>; <strong>Tim Sehn,</strong> Snapâs <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-sehn-snapchat-senior-vp-of-engineering-leaves-company-2017-11\">senior V.P. of engineering</a>; and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-vp-of-product-tom-conrad-leaves-tech-2018-1\">V.P. of product</a> <strong>Tom Conrad.</strong></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://cheddar.com/videos/snap-employees-eye-exist-as-stock-sinks\">Cheddar</a>, Snap executives have done their best to downplay employeesâ concerns about morale. <strong>Jerry Hunter,</strong> Snapâs engineering chief, has told them that Snapâs turnover rate is normal for the industry. (The average yearly turnover rate in Internet tech is <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/trends-and-research/2018/the-3-industries-with-the-highest-turnover-rates\">14.9 percent</a>.) Itâs unclear whether this is the case&#8212;Snap has yet to make its yearly turnover rate public&#8212;but if employees are wavering, itâs hard to blame them. The companyâs problems are manifold. Snap reported a decline in daily active users in the second quarter, and earlier this month, an analyst <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/snap-tumbles-as-analyst-predicts-company-will-have-to-go-begging-for-cash-in-2019\">predicted</a> that it could be in such dire straits next year that it will need to beg for cash: âWhile it is obvious that Snap wasnât prepared for life as a public company, it now has a more pressing problem,â <strong>Michael Nathanson</strong> wrote in a note to clients, obtained by <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/09/snap-hits-new-all-time-low-after-analyst-sees-cash-raise.html\">CNBC</a>. âIt is quickly running out of money.â (Snap did not respond to CNBCâs request for comment.)</p>\n<p>At present, shareholders are waiting on tenterhooks for Snap to release its Thursday earnings report. If its active-user numbers decline again, advertisers are reportedly poised to flee. âSome advertisers are less enthusiastic about Snapchat than they used to be,â <strong>Debra Aho Williamson,</strong> an analyst at eMarketer, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-25/snap-s-user-growth-struggles-raise-questions-from-advertisers\">told</a> Bloomberg. âThey do feel that they get a bigger audience and potentially better tools from Instagram, and thatâs super attractive to them.â If advertisers do jump ship, the blame lies squarely with Spiegel&#8212;though Snapchat disputed that he was blind to the threat, multiple sources told <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-08-22/nobody-trusts-facebook-twitter-is-a-hot-mess-what-is-snap-s-evan-spiegel-doing\">Bloomberg</a> back in August that the Snap C.E.O. ârefusedâ to believe Instagramâs copycat features were siphoning growth away from Snapchat. Ultimately, Spiegelâs purported hubris could be responsible not only for his companyâs downward spiral, but for his failure to keep people on board. âNo exec challenges Evan,â a former Snap employee told Bloomberg. âNo exec who lasts over a month, anyway.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Uber wants to be the next Amazon; but it <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/uber-the-next-amazon-but-others-see-the-next-yahoo?inline\">could end up the next Yahoo</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Meet the fake Saudi prince with a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/10/he-actually-believes-he-is-khalid-the-odyssey-of-a-counterfeit-saudi-prince?inline\">30-year plan</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; We talked to the most <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/inside-yamam-top-secret-israeli-anti-terrorism-operation?inline\">elite counterterrorism unit in the world</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why Michael Bloombergâs massive donations might <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/michael-bloomberg-funds-democrats-in-2018?inline\">not actually help him be president</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/where-is-barack-obama-2018-midterms?inline\">Where is Obama?</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more?

Can Evan Spiegel turn it all around, or will he be forced to sell out?","body":"<p>As he read what was presumably a prepared statement to investors on an earnings call Thursday, Snap C.E.O. <strong>Evan Spiegelâs</strong> tone recalled a man at the gallows. âWe have a significant opportunity to grow and broaden our global community over the long term,â he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCFastMoney/status/1055575583860686848\">said</a> in a grim monotone. âThere are billions of people worldwide who do not yet use Snapchat.â The reason for his consternation was abundantly clear: Snap, which has seen more than half of its value erased since its March 2017 I.P.O., announced in its third-quarter earnings report that its number of daily active users had fallen <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-25/snapchat-lost-users-in-quarter-and-says-decline-will-continue\">to 186 million</a>, and predicted another drop in users in the fourth quarter. The news sent the companyâs stock tumbling as much as 12 percent to an all-time low of $6.28. The reasons for Snapchatâs decline are manifold&#8212;a botched redesign, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/snap-employees-look-for-a-way-out-before-the-walls-cave-in\">low internal morale</a>, a string of executive departures, Facebookâs successful replication of Snapchatâs best features in Instagram&#8212;but one thing seems clear: what could have been an aberration now appears to be an existential issue that could threaten the future of the company.</p>\n<p>Still, some employees have their hopes pinned on an Android redesign, <a href=\"https://cheddar.com/videos/snap-employees-eye-exist-as-stock-sinks\">code-named Mushroom</a>, to turn things around, a prospect that Spiegel, too, has teased. Android users make up a majority of the global smartphone market, and as Spiegel said in his <a href=\"https://investor.snap.com/~/media/Files/S/Snap-IR/reports-and-presentations/q3-2018-prepared-remarks.pdf\">prepared remarks</a>, Android users are âa global growth opportunity for us,â and that the new app is âlightweight, modular, and performant.â The original Android app was slow and buggy, as Snapchat initially prioritized its iOS app over Android. âSnapâs users are vocal, loyal, and fickle,â one investor told me. âHitching your hopes to the company on the strength of another app redesign is risky, but Snap knows the stakes.â</p>\n<p>Analysts, however, are markedly less hopeful. Although Spiegel has told employees in a memo that he hopes to make Snap profitable next year, some experts donât believe he has done nearly enough to address the elephant in the room: Facebook, and the imminent threat it poses. Back in August, multiple sources told <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-08-22/nobody-trusts-facebook-twitter-is-a-hot-mess-what-is-snap-s-evan-spiegel-doing\">Bloomberg</a> that the Snap C.E.O. initially ârefusedâ to believe that Instagramâs copycat features were siphoning growth away from Snapchat (Snap denied this characterization)&#8212;an alleged oversight that, if true, may have cost his company. âInstagram Storiesâ daily active users now dramatically larger than Snapchat and time spent among your core teen/young-adult demo now far more evenly split than a year ago between Instagram and Snapchat,â <strong>Rich Greenfield,</strong> an analyst at BTIG, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-25/snapchat-lost-users-in-quarter-and-says-decline-will-continue\">told Bloomberg</a>.</p>\n<p>Thatâs not to say that all hope is lost&#8212;Twitter was able to pull off a comeback in 2018, two years after it looked like a prime acquisition target with a tumbling stock price. But analyst <strong>Michael Nathanson</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/snap-tumbles-as-analyst-predicts-company-will-have-to-go-begging-for-cash-in-2019\">more skeptical</a> of Snap. âWhile it is obvious that Snap wasnât prepared for life as a public company, it now has a more pressing problem. It is quickly running out of money,â he wrote in a note to clients. âCall us skeptical as&#8212;despite the memo&#8212;we donât have faith in Snapâs leadership to navigate these rapids.â Nathanson predicted the company will have to raise capital  as soon as mid-2019, and revised his 2019 revenue estimates earlier this month, cutting them by 7 percent and forecasting both slower user growth and revenue per user growth.</p>\n<p>N.Y.U.âs <strong>Scott Galloway</strong> more or less agreed. âI believe this company is going out of business,â he <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/9/28/17912266/pivot-kara-swisher-scott-galloway-podcast-first-episode-amazon-snapchat-instagram-tech-bias\">told</a> Recodeâs <strong>Kara Swisher</strong> last month. âSnap will not be an independent company by the end of 2019.â He sees Google and Amazon are the most likely potential buyers, and of the two, he said Amazon makes more sense. âI think Bezos says, âAll right, you have a core constituency that buys stuff and buys stuff irrationally,ââ he explained. âHigh-margin coffee, flying knit tennis shoes, theyâre crazy. We love teenagers because theyâre stupid because they spend all their money.â Another investor I spoke with agreed, adding that if Snap does sell, it will almost surely go at a steeply discounted rate to one of a small number of possible buyers. âTelecom giant? Maybe. Facebook? Definitely not. Google? Theyâve failed at social already. Apple? Maybe, but it seems like a long shot, and itâs hard to see Snap fitting into Appleâs existing thesis.â Noting that <strong>Tim Stone,</strong> Snapâs new C.F.O., was a longtime executive at Amazon, as well as the fact that Snap and Amazon launched a joint e-commerce initiative this month, they concluded, âSnapâs best hope in an acquisition scenario is Amazon.â</p>","rubric":"Snap","socialTitle":"Will Jeff Bezos Bail Out Snapchat?","socialDescription":"Snapchatâs daily user numbers are down, its stock price is tumbling, and Facebook looks like more of a threat than ever.

Recently, the company has dealt with an endless parade of bad news, from a widely panned redesign of its app, to a precipitous drop in daily active users, to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/another-snap-exec-heads-for-the-exits-as-stock-sinks-to-a-new-low\">departures of key executives</a>, including chief strategy officer, <strong>Imran Khan,</strong> who a source told my colleague <strong>Maya Kosoff</strong> was âintegral to everything.â And now it can add <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/09/snap-hits-new-all-time-low-after-analyst-sees-cash-raise.html\">this</a> to the list:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âWhile it is obvious that Snap wasn&#39;t prepared for life as a public company, it now has a more pressing problem. It is quickly running out of money,â analyst <strong>Michael Nathanson</strong> of MoffettNathanson wrote Tuesday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nathanson cut his 2019 revenue estimates by 7 percent and his 2020 estimates by 15 percent, forecasting both slower user growth as well as slower revenue per user growth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Nathanson, the cash-strapped company will likely need to raise capital as early as mid-2019, the same year C.E.O. Spiegel told employees in a recent memo that he hopes Snap will turn profitable. In that same memo, Spiegel panned the app redesign. âIn our excitement to innovate and bring many new products into the world, we have lost the core of what made Snapchat the fastest way to communicate,â he wrote, calling the update that <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong> dubbed â<a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/02/22/technology/snapchat-update-kylie-jenner/index.html\">so sad</a>â ârushed.â (Snap did not immediately respond to CNBCâs request for comment.)</p>\n<p>While Nathanson acknowledged that Twitter was able to <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/how-twitter-made-the-tech-worlds-most-unlikely-comeback\">pull off a comeback</a> in 2018 after being essentially left for dead, the analyst doesnât see a similar story playing out for Snap. âCall us skeptical as&#8212;despite the memo&#8212;we donât have faith in Snapâs leadership to navigate these rapids,â he wrote.</p>","rubric":"Snap","socialTitle":"Snap Tumbles as Analyst Predicts Company Will Have to Go Begging for Cash in 2019","socialDescription":"âWe donât have faith in Snapâs leadership to

the black T-shirts, tattoos, and decidedly un-Canadian attitude, you might  assume that Shane Smith was channeling Henry Rollins circa Black Flag. Instead, the media mogul has other ambitions.  âI want to be like Tom Freston,â he told <em>The New York Times</em> in 2012, referring to the co-founder of MTV.\n<p>After graduating from Ottawaâs Carleton University with a dual degree in English-lit and poli-sci, Smith decamped to Montreal with buddies Suroosh Alvi and Gavin McInnes and bought the government-funded community rag <em>Voice of Montreal.</em> âMontrealâ and the âoâ in âvoiceâ were ditched and the trio again decamped, this time, to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, circa 2001. Here Vice would plant its flag and make a name for itself as the coolest new media company east of the East River (a bit ahead of the tsunami of yuppie bohemian wannabes that would eventually wash over the neighborhood, turning it into a parody of itself).</p>\n<p>Smith is serious about journalism, even if it is âgonzo journalism for the YouTube generation,â as <em>The New York Times</em> dubbed it. Viceâs roving army of twentysomething correspondents has been derided as âstunt journalists,â but Smith prefers to refer to what his acolytes are practicing as âimmersion journalism.â And immerse themselves they do.</p>\n<p>Smith and his correspondents have dropped in to places where youâll rarely find mainstream broadcasters regularly hanging out&#8212;Darfur, Iran, North Korea, Liberia. In Liberia, in fact, Smith interviewed a brutal ex-warlord/cannibal who went by the name General Butt Naked (real name: Joshua Blahyi) for his love of heading into battle in his birthday suit. âHeâs charming and nice,â Smith told the Huffington Post, but âit spins your brain out.â Another brain-spinner occurred when a Vice crew accompanied Dennis Rodman on his visit to North Korea, in 2013.</p>\n<p>With Viceâs annual revenue closing in on $1 billion, and the launch of itâs own cable channel, there have been murmurs of an I.P.O. or a sale. âRight now we have a decision to make,â Smith recently told CNBC, âbecause we&#39;re topping out the valuation where a media company should buy us.â Talk like that oughta make Tom Freston proud.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/01/574f46ddee949d2f6143245e_hive-contributor-profile-shane-smith.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:34 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-shane-smith.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-shane-smith.jpg","credit":"By Sean Zanni/PatrickMcMullan.com.","_links":{},"id":"574f46ddb58adb2f614da235","createdAt":"June 1, 2016 4:34 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:34 pm","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/shane-smith","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/01/574f46ddee949d2f6143245e_hive-contributor-profile-shane-smith.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:34 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-shane-smith.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-shane-smith.jpg","credit":"By Sean Zanni/PatrickMcMullan.com.","_links":{},"id":"574f46ddb58adb2f614da235","createdAt":"June 1, 2016 4:34 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 1, 2016 4:34 pm","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"574f46eabdf148e4205f29e4","revision":0,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/shane-smith"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"New <em>Aladdin</em> Trailer Offers First Look at Will Smithâs Genie in Action","promoHed":"New <em>Aladdin</em> Trailer Offers First Look at Will Smithâs Genie in Action","dek":"A Grammy night surprise delivers something old, something new, something borrowed, and something very blue.","promoDek":"A Grammy night surprise delivers something old, something new, something borrowed, and something very blue.","body":"<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7hHECMVOq7g\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7hHECMVOq7g\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>Weâre only a few months away from the debut of one of <em>three</em> live-action Disney films this year.

At the very least, award-winning composers <strong>Benj Pasek</strong> and <strong>Justin Paul</strong> have <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/aladdin-live-action-princess-jasmine-song\">put together</a> a new song for Scottâs Jasmine to sing, and dusted off some of the regressive lyrics in <strong>Alan Menken,</strong> <strong>Tim Rice,</strong> and Howard Ashmanâs âArabian Nights.â Meanwhile, Smith&#8212;who was worried there wouldnât be much more material to mine from the Genie character after Williamsâs iconic performance&#8212;has promised his version will come with some âhip-hop flavorâÂ while also serving as an homage to the original film.</p>\n<p>Though Disney could have leaned on this new material in this first full ad, the studio instead went with some nostalgia-soaked goodness. (The same strategy that made last yearâs <em>Lion King</em> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/disney-is-already-winning-big-with-its-new-lion-king-trailer\">teaser</a> such a smash hit online.) But fans will have a better sense of what new ideas director <strong>Guy Ritchie</strong> has to offer when the film premieres on May 24, 2019.</p>","rubric":"Friend Like Me","socialTitle":"New Aladdin Trailer Offers First Look at Will Smithâs Genie in Action","socialDescription":"A Grammy night surprise delivers something old, something new, something borrowed, and something very blue.","seoTitle":"New Aladdin Trailer Offers First Look at Will Smithâs Genie in Action","seoDescription":"A Grammy night surprise delivers something old, something new, something borrowed, and something very blue.","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Movies","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","interactiveOverride":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["aladdin","grammys"],"revisionAuthor":"Katie Commisso","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5c410f1bfe877f02adebaf00","revision":33,"createdAt":"January 17, 2019 6:26 pm","modifiedAt":"February 10, 2019 9:25 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"February 10, 2019 9:25 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Hollywood","slug":"hollywood","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fae03af0739cf33e0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Movies","slug":"movies","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120c639a3587939aa6b","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"aladdin","slug":"aladdin","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb89a7a97170b7549312a","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:24 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:24 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:24 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"grammys","slug":"grammys","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb80812afc00c253e55fa","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Joanna Robinson is a Hollywood writer covering TV and film for VanityFair.com.

With her first film role, the actress has already made history&#8212;becoming the first Indigenous Mexican woman to earn a best-actress Oscar nomination. Aparicio joined <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> star <strong>Henry Golding,</strong> <em>The Hate U Give</em>âs <strong>Amandla Stenberg,</strong> and <em>Vanity Fair</em>âs executive West Coast editor, <strong>Krista Smith,</strong> to celebrate a class of new and emerging talent.</p>\n<p>Smith has been prognosticating future Hollywood stars for two decades now, via her <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/01/vanities-slideshow\">monthly Vanities feature</a> in the magazine. âI feel like I am the <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> of young Hollywood, because Iâve been doing this for a long time,â she laughed Tuesday. âEvery year thereâs something new thatâs happening, but new Hollywood today really feels like thereâs a difference&#8212;in what stories are being told and who is telling them. Part of that is because of Netflix and Hulu and streaming, but thereâs been a real shift, and itâs incredible to watch.â</p>\n<p>Her co-host Golding just capped an incredible first year in Hollywood, between starring turns in <em>A Simple Favor</em> and <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em>&#8212;the latter of which earned over $200 million at the box office and proved to be a game changer for Asian representation on-screen. After chatting to <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> author <strong>Kevin Kwan</strong> and co-star <strong>Gemma Chan,</strong> Golding reflected on his âhecticâ year&#8212;made all the more surreal by his invitation to be <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/hollywood-cover-2019?verso=true\">photographed</a> by Oscar-winning cinematographer <strong>Emmanuel âChivoâ Lubezki</strong> for the <em>Vanity Fair</em> Hollywood cover. He is so popular&#8212;and looks so good in a tux&#8212;that the Internet has been calling for Golding to be named the next James Bond, but the actor waved off the 007 speculations as ârumors. Itâs an honor to be even discussed in the same conversation. But <strong>Daniel Craig</strong> is, for me, an amazing Bond. And so long may he reign.â</p>\n<p>Nearby, fellow co-host Amandla Stenberg chatted with friends and colleagues at the event, including Rodarte designer <strong>Laura Mulleavy,</strong> <em>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</em>âs <strong>Rachel Bloom,</strong>  <strong>Whitney Cummings,</strong> <strong>Alia Shawkat,</strong> <em>Grown-ish</em>âs <strong>Francia Raisa,</strong> <strong>Rory Culkin,</strong> <strong>Nina Dobrev,</strong> and <strong>Finn Wittrock.</strong> Meanwhile, actress <strong>Harley Quinn Smith</strong> articulated her excitement about seeing her friends getting to start new narratives in film and television.</p>\n<p>âNow is the time to share stories that have been swept under the rug, because maybe theyâre about people of color, people in the L.G.B.T. community, or about women, and to celebrate them,â said Smith. âItâs a great time to be a part of the entertainment industry, because people are finally, actually getting to tell the truth. Itâs not just one story about a cis white couple told over and over again. Itâs a new opportunity. With <em>Eighth Grade,</em> I have anxiety and depression, and to see that represented on-screen, for young women especially, was really cool. Amandaâs movie <em>The Hate U Give</em> was so beautiful and it was so time for that film to be made. That one really hit me hard.â Hopeful, she added, âa new generation of Hollywood is the opportunity to spotlight diversity and stories that havenât been told before.â</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5c48d2452795511ceb00000b.js?muted=1\"></div></div>","rubric":"ON THE SCENE","socialTitle":"Henry Golding, Yalitza Aparicio, and Amandla Stenberg Celebrate New Hollywood","socialDescription":"The actors joined V.F. executive West Coast editor Krista Smith to kick off Oscar week in Los Angeles.","seoTitle":"Henry Golding, Yalitza Aparicio, and Amandla Stenberg Celebrate New Hollywood","seoDescription":"The actors joined V.F. executive West Coast editor Krista Smith to kick off Oscar week in Los Angeles.","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Award Season","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","interactiveOverride":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["oscars"],"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5c6c95913fc1123162a5ca11","revision":31,"createdAt":"February 19, 2019 6:47 pm","modifiedAt":"February 20, 2019 1:46 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"February 20, 2019 1:46 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Hollywood","slug":"hollywood","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fae03af0739cf33e0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Award Season","slug":"award-season","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120b4f5c10202b9717a","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"oscars","slug":"oscars","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7e64f46c70bca18e2df","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Julie Miller is a Senior Hollywood writer for <em>Vanity Fair</em>âs website.

I wasnât in charge of it,â Sarandos said during the conference. âBut in general there was a disparity. What it did for us was it had us go back and look at all of our productions&#8212;and all of our productions that were being run by third parties&#8212;and make sure that none of those disparities existed.â Sarandos also mentioned adjusting the salary of an unnamed female executive, given her male counterparts had quoted higher histories for the same position.</p>\n<p>The Netflix content head nonetheless deferred to hiring âsenior executives who you trust, who look like the worldâ to keep the companyâs representations of diversity on track, rather than committing to any one initiative. âItâs in practice, it isnât a plaque we hang on the wall,â Sarandos said of lessons learned from the <em>Crown</em> scandal. âItâs something that we do every day. I think that the Claire-Matt issue, as complicated as it is, pointed to a bigger problem throughout the industry.â</p>","rubric":"Streaming Salaries","socialTitle":"The Crown Gender-Pay Gap Made

befitting the woman whose husband was the first American president to share his playlists, <strong>Michelle Obama</strong> made an appearance at the 61st Grammy Awards on Sunday night.</p>\n<p>After a performance by <strong>Camila Cabello, Ricky Martin,</strong> and Colombian singer <strong>J Balvin,</strong> host <strong>Alicia Keys</strong> introduced the evening and invited her âsistersâ to join her. A door on the stage opened up, and out came <strong>Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith, Jennifer Lopez,</strong> and the former First Lady herself, wearing a green sequin pantsuit. The group spoke about the impact that music has had on their lives. When Obama opened her mouth, she only got a few words out before the words were interrupted by joyful cheers from the audience.</p>\n<p>âFrom the Motown records I wore out on the South Side to the âWho Run the Worldâ songs that fueled me through this last decade, music has always helped me tell my story,â she said once the applause had quieted. âMusic helps us share ourselves, our dignity and sorrows, our hopes and joys. . . . Music shows us that all of it matters.â</p>\n<p>After the women left the stage, <strong>Shawn Mendes</strong> came out to perform his song âIn My Blood,â nominated for song of the year, where he was joined by <strong>Miley Cyrus,</strong> and the two were showered with sparks. Gaga came back onstage minutes later to accept the first award of the night, best pop performance by a duo/group, for âShallowâ from the <em>A Star Is Born</em> soundtrack.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The dirty truth about <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/the-dirty-secret-of-el-chapo-downfall?inline\">El Chapoâs downfall</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; That time <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/brian-rea-modern-love-death-wins-a-goldfish?inline\">death took a break</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The 25 <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/25-best-movie-scenes?inline\">most influential movie scenes</a> of the past 25 years</p>\n<p>&#8212; Acupuncture and hypno-birthing?

The issue went on to inspire countless imitations. Now, Krista Smith talks with the iconic stars about the clothes, the controversy, and creating history with legendary photographer Annie Leibovitz.","body":"<h2>The Moment</h2>\n<p><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow:</strong> Iâve had this very long, amazing, and very public career, and that cover was the first articulation of what was to come. I kept thinking I didnât deserve to be there. I was young and those women were the biggest stars of the day&#8212;I mean, I donât even think I was going out with Brad Pitt yet! It was this indelible moment for me because in some way it defined my daydream coming true.</p>\n<p><strong>Nicole Kidman:</strong> I just remember being amazed that I was included. Iâd done âDays of Thunderâ and âMaliceâ and I was feeling like, âHow did I get this? This is incredible.â</p>\n<p><strong>Patricia Arquette:</strong> I remember them talking about how it havenât been done before. All these actresses, tons of makeup people everywhere. Wardrobe people, and all these different clothes.</p>\n<p><strong>Angela Bassett:</strong> Being in this crowd of people and being called to be a part of it was really wonderful, and I wonât say intimidating â¦ but I was the only woman of color in that room. Youâre that one in the room. Just that one. But many came after.</p>\n<p><strong>Uma Thurman:</strong> Being on <em>Vanity Fair</em> was always a sort of benchmark of achievement. It was definitely always an honor that somehow or another youâve done or been involved with some good work and it was being recognized.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/hollywood-cover-2019\"><em>View the full 2019 Hollywood Cover: Moving Pictures here.</em></a></h3>\n<p><strong>Sandra Bullock:</strong> Iâm not comfortable in my own skin in front of a still camera. Moving camera, as long as Iâm not having to look at you, you just catch what Iâm doing. Still camera, forget it. I will do everything I possibly can to avoid being in a photo shoot. Annie Leibovitz was so relaxed and great, but I literally was trying to just shove myself in a corner and you can kind of see that in the photo. I was like how far off screen can I go and still be a part of this amazing group of women.</p>\n<p><strong>AB:</strong> Sandra was just adorable, we were asked to be the model and she was so not the model and was like âhow should I stand?â It was very endearing and charming. I didnât know how to stand either and oh my God when I see the pictures, one of my hands looks like the claw!</p>\n<p><strong>Jennifer Jason Leigh:</strong> We didnât know this would become an annual thing, and whatâs so fun about seeing each year since is that whoever is on the cover is going to make an imprint in some way on our society. A performance, a role, or a debut&#8212;and itâs kind of incredible when you look back.</p>\n<p><strong>Julianne Moore:</strong> I had just moved to L.A. and had totally changed my life. I barely had my bearings, and I donât think I was even a very good driver at that point, and then there I was on the cover, which ended up as a billboard on Sunset Boulevard!</p>\n<h2>The Controversy</h2>\n<p><strong>JJL:</strong> Yeah, [the billboard] was up on Sunset. It wasnât just a bunch of girls in lingerie you know, it had a sense of humor, it had like a little bit of a kick and bite to it. And satire to it which I really appreciated and loved.</p>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> I remember a big stink about, âYou finally got of all these actresses but you have them all wearing lingerieâ.  There was a big blow-back from that. But you know, itâs funny, I feel like some of the most pivotal movies and moments in film, women are wearing old slips like that.</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker:</strong>  The cover caused so much conversation and a lot of controversy about what we were wearing, that we had somehow been exploited or objectified ourselves. In fact, it was the opposite of that. Iâve never felt that Iâve worn things in any shoot with Annie that I didnât want to be wearing, that I didnât feel comfortable wearing, or that I was diminished in the process. It was powerful.</p>\n<p><strong>JM:</strong> It was one of my very early cover shoots. I didnât even know what a cover shoot was, you know? I can remember going there, we each had a little cubicle, and everybody in editorial was weighing in on what I should wear, I kept trying things on, and it was unclear about whether or not my outfit was really a dress or just a slip? I think it was just a slip.</p>\n<p><strong>SB:</strong> I knew I did not want to be in my underwear. I was like âDear God, give me the longest thing thatâs left.â My little outfit was really tight, it was like one long Spanx. I was a rebel from the ankles down.</p>\n<p><strong>Linda Fiorentino:</strong> It was like the most expensive pajama party in history. . . . Most of the wardrobe had been taken, which is how I ended up topless. Every time weâd pick a top, Annie was like, âNo, but someone else is wearing something similar. No, but sheâs wearing that, too.â I finally said, âForget it. Iâll just go topless,â and she, in her own inimitable Annie deadpan way, said, âWell, how can I say no to that?â</p>\n<h2>The Photographer</h2>\n<p><strong>PA:</strong> Annie has such a cool energy.  Very inclusive and makes you feel good. Even though we all felt weird or nervous, her warmth greets you and makes you feel itâs going to be okay. Thank God, it was her.</p>\n<p><strong>NK:</strong> I remember being in awe of Annie because sheâs just such a force. And Iâve shot subsequently with her and sheâs documented so much of my life. So, to be just to be the focus of her vision... I just remember being completely intimidated because sheâs amazing.</p>\n<p><strong>UT:</strong> The two Hollywood covers I did, both with Annie, in one she talked me into wearing the shortest skirt Iâve almost ever been photographed in and in the other she walked into the dressing room exactly the same way and was determined for me to be wearing pants. I was thrilled, so I had both ends of the spectrum with the same photographer. Annieâs always very intense, and sheâs always worth it.</p>\n<p><strong>AB:</strong> I remember Annie would come around and just sit in front of you and talk to you and and introduce herself. With her hair just all in in the way in of her glasses. You know, looks pretty much the same today as she did that day. Consistency.</p>\n<p><strong>SJP:</strong>  The only thing you have to know is Annie will shoot until sheâs dragged away. I have been in the middle of the East River with her in a terrible storm and lightning, and cables being dragged through water, being held up by crew members so no oneâs electrocuted, she will shoot, and you have to have the stamina that she has. You canât give up on her, and that day of the first Hollywood cover was a perfect example.</p>\n<h2>Then &amp; Now</h2>\n<p><strong>UT:</strong> That was the first time a lot of the actresses are with each other when theyâre not competing with each other.</p>\n<p><strong>GP:</strong> Itâs changed so much. If you were to do that now and you walked into a room of all these women, I feel like it would be so supportive, but it was a different time. At first, it was really intimidating, but it was actually fantastic.</p>\n<p><strong>AB:</strong> We were all pretty new to our career. It was very endearing and charming because most of the othersâ work is young, beautiful, strong and the real deal. And I just felt like I didnât know any of them. It was that first day in first grade when youâre trying to get to know one another.</p>\n<p><strong>SB:</strong> The fact that we were the first is pretty badass. It was nice to have connections with women when we were so isolated from each other. The only time we saw each other was when we were at the same audition.

But there was a darker side to the story: hundreds of local contractors in the Bahamas, where the event was held, were completely ripped off after the festival dissolved into a catastrophe. Fyre co-founder <strong>Billy McFarland</strong> abandoned them without payment for months of labor when the whole thing went haywire.</p>\n<p>So while it was obviously easy fodder for Twitter jokes, the Fyre Festival saga also has plenty to do with class divides, the justice system, and, yes, the ways in which in which social-media obsession has led some people to prioritize image over reality&#8212;even when doing so comes at a steep psychological price.</p>\n<p>Netflixâs documentary on the subject, <em>Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened,</em> examines all of these dynamics. But more than anything, director <strong>Chris Smith</strong> sees his film as a character portrait of McFarland himself. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, when Smith reached out to the entrepreneur-turned-convicted fraudster for an interview, he received the most fitting response imaginable: Smith says McFarland initially agreed to film with Smith and his team, but after postponing on two different occasions, he changed his mind, saying he wanted to be paid for his appearance.</p>\n<p>âHe said that he had an offer for $250,000 to film with someone else,â Smith told <em>V.F.</em> in a recent interview. âAfter spending time with this story and interviewing so many people that had been hurt by his actions, it just felt ethically wrong for us, so we told him we wouldnât be able to do that . . . And then he asked us if we would do it for $125,000. And we said no. And then he came back and asked if we would do it for $100,000 in cash.â</p>\n<p>âHe would tell us, âI donât like these guys, so if you can do $125,000 Iâll shoot with you.â But it started to get ridiculous,â Smith added, âto the point where it was just . . . I started to get worried [about] anything that he would be telling us&#8212;that it would be hard to really trust.â</p>\n<p>McFarland does, indeed, appear in another Fyre Festival documentary, <em>Fyre Fraud,</em> which had a surprise premiere on Hulu Monday. A source confirmed to <em>V.F.</em> that producers for the Hulu doc did compensate McFarland to license footage.</p>\n<p>But either way, Smith has no idea how much money McFarland actually received from the rival doc&#8212;âbecause he was such a good hustler . . . He always had an angle. And I think, in the end, it was just impossible for him to give up his story for free, because he just had to make a deal.â</p>\n<p>That is a running theme in <em>Fyre,</em> which documents the collapse of McFarlandâs most infamous venture&#8212;as well as the havoc it wreaked in many lives. The film offers a meticulous procedural account of the eventâs downfall, and features interviews not only with several people who worked with Fyre co-founders McFarland and <strong>Ja Rule</strong> to develop their music-booking app, but also with multiple Bahamian locals whom McFarland and the Fyre team left without compensation. It also offers a carefully reported, if completely vexed, portrait of McFarland himself.</p>\n<p>âI did look at it as a character study,â Smith said. âI thought it was this portrait of an individual who was able to sell himself as well as he sold his companies. And that led to this situation where he was able to build himself into this whiz-kid entrepreneur and raise money to build these companies, and ultimately build this festival.â</p>\n<p>As the documentary proves, looks can be deceiving&#8212;and McFarlandâs persona was better at event planning than the real guy turned out to be. McFarland canât seem to help himself from scheming; even <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-11/festival-fraudster-who-targeted-status-seekers-gets-six-years\">while out on bail</a> following his first fraud conviction, he was already launching another scam to sell pricey, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/william-mcfarland-pleads-guilty-manhattan-federal-court-engaging-fraudulent-ticket-scam\">âexclusiveâ</a> tickets he did not have.</p>\n<p>When the news of McFarlandâs latest brazen scam broke, Smith and his team had already shot a good portion of their film, he said. Even knowing what they did about McFarland, it came as a surprise. âIâm wired so fundamentally different than him, it was very hard for me to understand how somebody who could be out on bail could start a company that was selling fraudulent tickets,â Smith said.</p>\n<p>That said, Smith doesnât think that McFarland ever intended to re-enact <em>Lord of the Flies</em> in the Bahamas. The director thinks the fraudster really did want to give Fyre Festival attendees the time of their lives; he just completely failed in his efforts.</p>\n<p>âI remember in the first interview, I think I asked if this was a scam,â Smith said. âThat was such a naÃ¯ve question . . . It became clear that Billy really wanted this to be a success, and wanted to be at the center of this world. It just was that they werenât equipped to pull this off.â</p>\n<p>Almost everyone Smith and his team interviewed were hesitant to appear on-camera, he said. Some were embarrassed about the role they had played in the fest; some were ashamed. But Smith wanted to put a more human face on what happened. âItâs always easy to look at something in hindsight, but when youâre in the middle of it all, and youâre not sleeping and everyoneâs stressed, and everyoneâs trying to pull off something [that] seems like itâs impossible . . . You have to convince yourself that itâs going to work,â he said.</p>\n<p>Viewers may be struck, however, to learn that Smith and his team partnered with Jerry Media and Matte Projects on this documentary&#8212;two companies that also worked on marketing for Fyre Festival itself. <em>Fyre Fraud</em> co-director <strong>Jenner Furst</strong> pointed this out in a recent interview with <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/movies/2019/1/15/18183308/fyre-festival-documentary-netflix-hulu-billy-mcfarland-pay\">the Ringer</a>, saying that the Netflix documentary committed a faux pas that is more serious than paying McFarland for an interview.</p>\n<p>âI feel like thereâs a bigger ethically compromised position, and thatâs going and partnering with folks who marketed the Fyre Festival and were well aware that this was not going to happen as planned&#8212;that folks were not going to get villas, that folks were not even going to get bathrooms,â Furst said. âWe have e-mails that prove that people knew months in advance what was going on, and we have a whistle-blower from inside that social-media company [Jerry] who says that he knew months before that this wasnât going to be what it was sold as.â</p>\n<p>According to Smith, this partnership played a crucial role in helping his movie secure the insider interviews it needed&#8212;especially with people who were worried about how they would look on-camera. In a statement to <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2019/01/14/hulu-fyre-festival-doc-netflix-surprise-release-source-info/\"><em>Entertainment Weekly</em></a> the <em>Fyre</em> filmmakers also defended their association with Jerry Media, saying, âWe were happy to work with Jerry Media and a number of others on the film. At no time did they, or any others we worked with, request favorable coverage in our film, which would be against our ethics. We stand behind our film, believe it is an unbiased and illuminating look at what happened, and look forward to sharing it with audiences around the world.â</p>\n<p>Smith would prefer viewers pay attention to how devastating the Fyre Fest ordeal was for the hundreds of Bahamian contractors who worked around the clock in a vain effort to make the event happen. In his film, restaurant owner <strong>MaryAnn Rolle</strong> tearfully recounts having to drain $50,000 from her personal savings to pay her staff for all the work they did on the event&#8212;and the pain she felt at having been so carelessly treated. âIt was traumatic for her and for her business, and sheâs still recovering from that,â Smith said. In another moment that didnât make it into the film, Smith recalled, Rolle said, âCan you imagine if some Bahamians came to the United States and did this festival and just left the way that Fyre did, with all these people being strung along and not paid?â</p>\n<p>âShe was like, âThere would be consequences,ââ Smith said, âand she said she didnât feel like her government had protected her.â</p>\n<p>That, Smith said, is what especially makes McFarlandâs return to his old New York penthouse lifestyle&#8212;after getting out on bail&#8212;so upsetting. âI didnât know how you could live with yourself in that way and not feel some sort of sense of responsibility,â he said. At least McFarland is no longer living large: this past October, he was sentenced to six years in prison.</p>\n<p>Representatives for Jerry Studios, Matte Projects, and Netflix did not immediately respond to <em>V.F.</em>âs request for comment regarding Jerry Mediaâs role in <em>Fyre</em>âs production. McFarlandâs attorney did not respond to <em>V.F.</em>âs request for comment.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A red carpet <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/chrissy-metz-alison-brie-hot-mic-babe-bitch-yanny-laurel-golden-globes-2019?inline\">Rorschach test</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Donât worry, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/nicole-kidman-rami-malek-golden-globes-snub-emails?inline\">Nicole Kidman and Rami Malek are friends</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Are we nearing the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/are-we-nearing-the-end-of-human-civilization-podcast?inline\">end of human civilization?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why some Democrats are <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/why-democrats-are-turning-on-obamas-legacy?inline\">reconsidering Obamaâs legacy</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; <em>Bird Box,</em> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/bird-box-netflix-memes-sandra-bullock?inline\">explained</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hollywood newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"up in flames","socialTitle":"Why Netflixâs Fyre Documentary Didnât Interview Billy McFarland","socialDescription":"âHe said that he had an offer for $250,000 to film with someone else,â director Chris Smith told V.F. âIt just felt ethically wrong for us . . .

dad.â","promoDek":"Director Guy Ritchie says the inspiration was âa muscular 1970s dad.â","body":"<p>When <strong>Will Smith</strong> was announced as the Genie in Disneyâs upcoming live-action remake of <em>Aladdin,</em> a few questions began percolating. Would he be C.G.I. so he could play the character with as much animated charm as Robin Williams? Would he be . . . blue? Or would he just be a normal, live-action, Will Smith-looking man dressed up in Agrabahn gear? Well, <a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/2018/12/19/aladdin-first-look-ew-cover-story/\"><em>Entertainment Weekly</em></a> has a first look at the <em>Aladdin</em> cast fully in character, Smith included, and it turns out the answer is the latter. Feast your eyes upon <em>this:</em></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/DisneyStudios/status/1075383325580128257\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DisneyStudios/status/1075383325580128257\">https://twitter.com/DisneyStudios/status/1075383325580128257</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Yes, thatâs Smith as the Genie, going with the bold choice of a thick goatee with a little hair clip and a big bald head, save for a topknot festooned with another golden clip. Well, it <em>appears</em> to be a topknot until you see the shot of Smithâs profile, which reveals the topknot to be a surprisingly long ponytail. Whatâs impressive is he manages to have no hair and entirely too much hair all at once!</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/EW/status/1075390633127395329\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EW/status/1075390633127395329\">https://twitter.com/EW/status/1075390633127395329</a></p></blockquote></div><p>According to Smith, the image in the <em>E.W.</em> spread isnât the final version of the character. âIâm gonna be BLUE,â he wrote in an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BrkhMBcBifX/\">Instagram caption</a>. Per <em>E.W.,</em> the film isnât finished, so the final rendering of the Genie is not yet available, but director <strong>Guy Ritchie</strong> teased that the new version of the Genie will look like âa muscular 1970s dadâ (and not, say, a modern version of <strong>Sinbad</strong> in <em>Shazam,</em> if <em>Shazam</em> were real).</p>\n<p>âHe was big enough to feel like a force&#8212;not so muscular that he looked like he was counting his calories, but formidable enough to look like you knew when he was in the room,â Ritchie said of his inspiration. Which, again, was 1970s dads. Dads from all other eras, back off, this isnât about you.</p>\n<p>Smith also spoke about the role, saying it was âterrifyingâ to take on the character after Williamsâs iconic performance in the original <em>Aladdin.</em></p>\n<p>âThe question is always: where was there meat left on the bone? Robin didnât leave a lot of meat on the bone with the character,â he added. However, the actor decided to give a performance that was an homage to Williams but musically divergent.</p>\n<p>âI think itâll stand out as unique even in the Disney world,â Smith said. âThere hasnât been a lot of that hip-hop flavor in Disney history.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8211; Is this the end of <a

unverified.","body":"<p>Christmas came about a week early for BuzzFeed on Wednesday, when a federal judge in Miami handed the Web site a major victory in a lawsuit that was filed in response to BuzzFeedâs controversial decision, in January 2017, to publish <strong>Christopher Steeleâs</strong> Trump-Russia dossier&#8212;the origin of the infamous pee tape allegation, and a road map of Trumpâs alleged ties to Russia, some of which have since been proved true. BuzzFeed initially failed to redact the name of a Cyprus-dwelling Russian technology executive, <strong>Aleksej Gubarev,</strong> whose company was accused in a brief passage of âusing botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data, and âconduct altering operationsâ against the Democratic party leadership.â</p>\n<p>Gubarev swiftly sued, claiming that his cameo in the explosive compendium of collusion allegations had cost him $130 million in business damages. BuzzFeed maintained that its decision to publish the dossier in full was protected by the First Amendment, and that it had done so in the public interest, since the secretive and unverified dossier was being discussed privately at the highest levels of government. But even within the journalistic community there was much criticism and hand-wringing over whether BuzzFeed had gone too far. The document had been circulating in official Washington for several months, but few of its claims had been verified, and some, at the time, seemed outlandish.</p>\n<p>The ruling was a vigorous and resounding statement of the rights of journalists, and a clear vindication for BuzzFeed. Judge <strong>Ursula Ungaro</strong> sided with BuzzFeed based on the so-called âfair reportâ privilege, which inoculates journalists against defamation suits when reporting on government affairs. â[The] privilege exists to protect the media while they gather the information needed for the public to exercise effective oversight of the government,â she <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5637767/12-19-18-Gubarev-Opinion.pdf\">wrote</a> in her ruling. <strong>Val Gurvits,</strong> the lead attorney for Gubarev, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/buzzfeed-dossier-lawsuit-dismissed-judge\">issued a statement</a> in response, promising an appeal: âFirst and foremost, nothing in todayâs ruling by the Court suggests in any way that the allegations concerning Mr. Gubarev [and his companies] were true. Instead, the Court ruled on a narrow legal issue, finding that BuzzFeed had a privilege to publish the information even if it was false. When we started this case, we knew that it would be a marathon and not a sprint. We remain convinced that, after appeal, this matter will be presented to a jury and that we will succeed in vindicating the Plaintiffsâ good names.â</p>\n<p>On Thursday afternoon, I got on the phone with BuzzFeed editor in chief <strong>Ben Smith</strong> to talk about the decision, as well as what it means for his publication&#8212;and for the dossier itself.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Vanity Fair:</em> The ruling must be a relief.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Ben Smith:</em> Itâs a huge relief. This was real threat to what we do, although one we were confident weâd win. But you can never be a hundred percent confident. And also, this kind of litigation is always distracting and draining. It was a relief in a way to see the legal side of this catch up with whatâs become a consensus: that the dossier is an important document.</p>\n<p><strong>Were you expecting this to go to trial?</strong></p>\n<p>We were optimistic about this motion. This motion really reflected a core thing about a reporterâs ability to cover the American government. Also, I think this was a big test for BuzzFeed as an institution, and for <strong>Jonah [Peretti, the C.E.O. of BuzzFeed].</strong> Iâm incredibly impressed with the extent to which he and the business leadership of the company, and the board, just took this on and stood by the newsroom beyond what I think anybody had any right to expect.</p>\n<p><strong>There was never any equivocation?</strong></p>\n<p>Not for a second.</p>\n<p><strong>If the case had gone to trial, the public may have gotten some insight into Christopher Steeleâs deposition, which would have been interesting and newsworthy.</strong></p>\n<p><em>The [New York] Times</em> has filed a motion to unseal documents in the case. In general Iâm in favor of making private documents public.</p>\n<p><strong>Were you briefed on what Steele said in his deposition?</strong></p>\n<p>No. Iâm not familiar with the documents under seal.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it a little terrifying being involved in litigation like this, where potentially tens of millions of dollars and the reputation of your news organization are on the line?</strong></p>\n<p>Itâs impossible not to have moments of real doubt and moments of real stress. It wasnât something I was worrying about day-to-day, but it sure felt good to win. More than I had realized, it was lingering in the back of my mind. Thatâs sometimes part of the point of litigation like this. I think in general, thereâs a disturbing pattern of foreign and domestic litigation being used to intimidate journalists. Thatâs why I think itâs incredibly important that Judge Ungaro decided this on the law. She made a very, very clear ruling on the law, and gave reporters real confidence that the broad protections of the First Amendment hold.</p>\n<p><strong>At any point since since publishing the dossier, has there been even a moment where you second-guessed the decision, or at least wondered if you could have done things differently?</strong></p>\n<p>Thereâs still another case pending and I canât get into lots of detail about our process as a result.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you think the criticism of the decision to publish was wrong and misguided across the board, or was there any slice of it where you thought, O.K., that person has a fair, or at least not unreasonable, point here?</strong></p>\n<p>I think a lot of people were acting in good faith, but I think they were wildly misguided and wrong, and in retrospect, it was not a close call, and Iâm not sure anyone thinks itâs a close call. Journalism can be this very small-c conservative profession, where people think, well, there must be a rule against that. I think people imagined thereâs a rule where you donât publish unverified allegations, which actually is what every indictment is. I think people were looking for reasons to argue this was wrong, and also maybe thought there was an element of good faith in <strong>Donald Trumpâs</strong> attacks on fake news. Maybe there was a perception that, if only the media would take it easy on the president, then heâd stop calling the media names, which obviously is not the case.</p>\n<p><strong>When I <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/06/christopher-steel-london-buzzfeed\">interviewed Gubarevâs lawyer</a> earlier this year, he told me, âWeâre not damaged by the fact that thereâs an allegation that Donald Trump colluded with Russia. We are damaged by the false allegations that my clients are F.S.B. agents who hacked the D.N.C. computers. Weâre annoyed that we got mixed up in a political fight.â Do you have any sympathy for that position?</strong></p>\n<p>I do think the constitutional protections on the free press mean that there is a lot of responsibility on us. Every time we write about someone accused of committing a crime, you should be sure to caveat that you havenât personally verified what is in the allegations. We feel we exercised that. It comes with these constitutionally protected rights, but thatâs almost irrelevant to the question of whether these rights are constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p><strong>And yet BuzzFeed did own up to not redacting Gubarevâs name in its initial publication of the dossier, and <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/2/3/14505574/buzzfeed-russian-trump-dossier-defamation-suit-apology\">apologized</a> for it. You went back and republished with his name blotted out. Was there anything else you should have done differently or would have done differently in hindsight?</strong></p>\n<p>As I said, I canât talk about the process stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think are the most fascinating and noteworthy things from the dossier that have been corroborated since you published it?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Paul Manafort</strong> has been indicted for things that are related to what was discussed in the dossier. Thatâs a pretty major thing. Also, itâs now clear that the social-media campaign&#8212;the Facebook campaign trying to sway Bernie supporters&#8212;was true, and a number of other specific details that seemed to match what investigators have found. A lot of things remain unverified, or seem hard to verify one way or the other. I think whatâs most extraordinary about it is, that when Steele started putting this thing together, some reporters had started to report out, hey, it looks like the Russians are interfering with this election on Trumpâs behalf. But that was not conventional wisdom like it is now. The broad outline of what Steele was writing is unquestionably true, and he was writing that in the summer of 2016, which is extraordinary.</p>\n<p><strong>Switching gears, what are your thoughts on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/business/media/buzzfeed-jonah-peretti-mergers.html\">Jonahâs proposal</a> of a mega-rollup of BuzzFeed, Vice, Vox Media, Refinery29, and Group Nine?</strong></p>\n<p>Anybody who covers this beat knows that some of these conversations about combining new media companies have been in the air. I think we are the strongest of those companies, and that all of those conversations wind up involving us, so I was pleased that Jonah floated it because we might as well be driving it.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think it could actually happen?</strong></p>\n<p>I donât know. I think it might. I donât think itâs crazy. But I think the specifics matter. Thereâs no abstract version of it</p>\n<p><strong>Is big, venture-funded digital media in trouble? Or are you guys all gonna figure it out in the next couple of years?</strong></p>\n<p>Itâs been reported that BuzzFeed has more than $300 million in revenue, and weâre growing. Obviously weâre all facing the same headwinds, but we think we have a lot of momentum and have successfully diversified into different businesses. My job is running the news operation, and I think weâve been punching above our weight and will continue to do that.</p>\n<p><strong>In that case, whatâs in store for BuzzFeed News in 2019?</strong></p>\n<p>We plan to be really ambitious about the biggest stories. We just brought in a new investigations editor. The 2020 Democratic primary is gonna be the greatest show on earth, and a lens through which many other stories get refracted. Our Twitter show is coming back in January and we plan to continue to build on it. We just put in a great new host on the Facebook Watch show weâre doing, and that show will be something that gets talked about and is a place where news happens. Weâre working on other broadcast projects T.B.D. Weâve got a lot going on.</p>\n<p><strong>Will it be a year of growth or a year of contraction?</strong></p>\n<p>I think itâs no secret Jonah has said weâre being really careful with costs. We think we have a lot of room for new projects and weâre looking forward to more of that, but weâre also gonna continue to manage our costs carefully. But look, the lawsuit is a real weight off our shoulders, and weâre feeling really great and upbeat and ambitious about next year.</p>","rubric":"The Trump-Russia Dossier","socialTitle":"BuzzFeed

Word,</em> which originally aired on Showtime from 2004 to 2009, was a touchstone for what it meant to <em>be</em> queer. The show was as beloved as it was argued about&#8212;inspiring dreams about the fast-paced earworm of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJhV2j6920M\">theme song</a> and heated discussions about whether a woman is really a Bette or a Shane (or somehow both??). Now the queer, <em>L Word</em>-addicted community can prepare to do it all again&#8212;because the series is <a href=\"https://tvline.com/2019/01/31/the-l-word-revival-series-order-showtime/\">being revived for an eight-episode order on Showtime</a>, with <strong>Marja-Lewis Ryan</strong> (<em>The Four-Faced Liar</em>) as its show-runner.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, original stars <strong>Katherine Moennig</strong> (Shane) and <strong>Leisha Hailey</strong> (Alice) joyfully <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtTv383FyDl/\">posted the news</a> of the revival on their Instagram accounts. They will appear in the new version of the show alongside <strong>Jennifer Beals</strong> (who played Bette), as will <a href=\"https://tvline.com/2019/01/31/the-l-word-revival-series-order-showtime/\">some reported new characters</a>. In the midst of a flood of earnest social-media posts cheering the showâs return (this writer sheepishly raises her hand), Showtime also released a professional-sounding statement about why now is the right time to bring <strong>Ilene Chaikenâs</strong> web of queer drama back to TV.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/jenniferbeals/status/1091034778961408000\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jenniferbeals/status/1091034778961408000\">https://twitter.com/jenniferbeals/status/1091034778961408000</a></p></blockquote></div><p>âMarja has brought her unique and contemporary vision to <em>The L Word</em> and blended it beautifully into the fabric of Ileneâs groundbreaking series,â said <strong>Gary Levine,</strong> Showtime entertainment president. âThis revered show was both entertaining and impactful when it originally ran on Showtime, and we are confident that our new version will do that and more in 2019.â</p>\n<p>The show has been off the air for almost a full decade now&#8212;enough time for a whole new generation of queer teens to be born, create some toxic inner-friendship romances of their own, and live to tell the tale.

plans on hold in favor of the late Queen of Soul.","body":"<p>Move over, Albert Einstein and Pablo Picasso. Thereâs a new <em>Genius</em> in town&#8212;and she brings with her a trunk stuffed with fur coats and iconic songs. Nat Geo has revealed that the third subject of its anthology docuseries will center on Aretha Franklin, a.k.a. the Queen of Soul, whose death this past summer prompted a flood of appreciations, fond remembrances, and above all, acknowledgments of her monumental contributions to music.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/02/genius-aretha-franklin-greenlighted-season-3-nat-geo-series-suzan-lori-parks-showrunner-1202553998/\">Deadline</a> reports that the announcement came Sunday at T.C.A.&#8212;where it was also revealed that Tony Award-nominated <strong>Suzan-Lori Parks,</strong> who became the first African-American woman to receive a Pulitzer Prize for drama in 2002 for her play <em>Topdog/Underdog,</em> will serve as executive producer and show-runner for this season. Also on board as executive producers are longtime Franklin collaborator <strong>Clive Davis</strong> and Atlantic Records C.E.O. <strong>Craig Kallman,</strong> as well as <em>Genius</em> stalwarts <strong>Ken Biller, Brian Grazer, Ron Howard,</strong> Francie Calfo, Gigi Pritzker, Rachel Shane,__ and <strong>Sam Sokolow.</strong> According to Deadline, the series will examine Franklinâs music and career&#8212;her talent, and the impact she had on the world as a civil-rights activist. The project will begin filming this summer, and is expected to debut in early 2020.</p>\n<p>National Geographic previously said that <em>Frankenstein</em> author Mary Shelley would be the subject of <em>Genius</em>âs third season, and Deadline reports that Shelley is still being considered for a future installment of the series. (In truth, itâs probably not a terrible idea for the network to let last yearâs <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mary-shelley-2018\">lackluster <em>Mary Shelley</em></a> fade from public memory before mining her life for another biographical project.) Thanks to the involvement of Davis, Kallman, and Warner Music Group, Deadline notes that the production will even have access to roughly 80 percent of Franklinâs catalog&#8212;including âI Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You),â âChain of Fools,â âDonât Play That Song,â âSince Youâve Been Gone,â and âBaby I Love You.â Expect all of those songs to make an appearance in the project, along with âI Knew You Were Waiting for Me,â âFreeway of Love,â and âSisters Are Doinâ It for Themselves.â</p>\n<p>Davis, who worked with Franklin for decades and spoke at her funeral, told Deadline, âAretha and I shared a 40-year friendship, ever since she cooked me dinner to talk about working together to reinvigorate her career. I am forever grateful to have had the opportunity to collaborate with her and her incredible instrument. She was a gift to the world, one that will last for many generations. I am thrilled to be celebrating her genius with Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, and Imagine.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The <a

But Weld has also studied recent presidential history, and knows that incumbents who face primary challengers typically lose. âHeâs clearly trying to derail Trump, as much as anything else,â explained Welch, who has followed Weld for several years as a reporter. âBut then, itâs also a bet,â he continued. âWho the hell knows whatâs going to happen with the Mueller investigation or with Trump himself. So someoneâs gotta be left standing, competing. So part of this, I think, is either heâll be the last guy standing, the only one whoâs foolish or brave enough to compete&#8212;or, by his example, other people whoâve been on the sidelines will now jump in.â</p>\n<p>Could Weld be the game-changing candidate who breaks the dam? Several other Republicans have been mulling runs, including <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/larry-hogan-2020-republican-primary-challenge\">popular Maryland Governor <strong>Larry Hogan</strong></a> and former Ohio governor <strong>John Kasich.</strong> Never Trumper operatives have <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/republicans-waiting-for-mueller-report-trump-2020-primary\">signaled</a> that should a challenger arise, thereâs a campaign apparatus in wait, donors and organizers and all.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are also substantial barriers to entry. The Trump-aligned G.O.P. has been taking measures to prevent any such challenge. The Republican National Committee has already taken steps to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/trump-2020-republican-party-purge-delegates\">cull disloyal party members</a>. At least one member of the R.N.C. has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/romneys-attack-prompts-call-to-protect-trump-from-2020-primary-challenger\">pushed</a> to change party rules that currently make it easy for a well-funded challenger to get a vote on the convention floor. And just in case any delegates get any funny ideas about standing up for their principles, the Trump campaign has begun meddling in state and local party elections to get reliably pro-Trump delegates into the convention. (As Trumpâs own senior campaign adviser <strong>Bill Stepien</strong> <a href=\"https://apnews.com/33438efb7d794b5caf0b60f815192500\">told the Associated Press</a>, âthe national convention is a television commercial for the president for an audience of 300 million, and not an internal fight.â)</p>\n<p>But given the strange makeup of several state primaries&#8212;New Hampshire, for instance, has an open primary that allows independents to vote&#8212;as well as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nearly-half-of-republicans-want-trump-to-face-a-primary-challenger-poll\">polls</a> suggesting that Republican voters would welcome a robust primary challenger, Weld might at least be able to cause the president some pain.</p>\n<p>The biggest complicating factor is probably Weld himself. âHeâs not charismatic enough, if weâre being honest,â said Welch. âNot to say he doesnât have personality, he does, heâs a very interesting, polished guy. But in the way thatâs going to make someoneâs knees tremble with excitement in Iowa, thatâs just not part of the package.â His support for <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Bill_Weld_Abortion.htm\">abortion rights</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/marijuana/2018/10/19/bill-weld-former-governor-marijuana-hype-man/YK3y067OB0nt4QuGq56UpM/story.html\">marijuana legalization</a> is also likely disqualifying for Trump-skeptical conservatives. At the same time, Weld clearly has no interest in running as a Democrat. âWe need the opposite of socialism,â he said Friday, echoing <strong>Howard Schultz,</strong> another long-shot contender for the White House who is plainly terrified by the <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</strong>-ification of the left.</p>\n<p>That doesnât leave Weld with much of a constituency, or a viable pathway outside of New Hampshire. But, as Welch says, âAnything is possible.â âYou know, youâve got a hundred to one odds for Trump back in the day. . . . So part of it is, hey, why not. Crazier things have happened so Iâm going to jump in.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

Cosby stood accused of drugging and sexually assaulting dozens of women throughout his career; he will serve 3 to 10 years at the maximum-security prison.</p>\n<p>âHeâs mentally strong; heâs just a strong man . . . Despite the circumstances, he said, âThis is an amazing experience,ââ Wyatt said. When pressed, he confirmed that Cosby actually used those words. âWhen I visit him, itâs nothing sad about it,â Wyatt said. âHe will never have remorse, and the reason why he has no remorse is because he did nothing wrong. He was not guilty.â</p>\n<p>In his own <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt1ETJfHLJH/\">statement</a> posted to Instagram Thursday, Cosby called himself a âpolitical prisonerâ and explained why he âwill never have remorse.â (Cosbyâs statement appears to be a longer version of the one NBC <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bill-cosby-not-remorseful-because-he-did-nothing-wrong-attorney-n970821\">released</a> Tuesday.)</p>\n<p>âI was given a deal; I settled out of court for $3.8 million dollars; I waived my 5th amendment rights; I was declared Not Guilty in 2005 by the Commonwealth - never charged,â Cosby wrote. âHowever, a low-life District Attorney and a corrupt Judge needed me Guilty now. Not for justice, but for their political aspirations.â</p>\n<p>âThey say, Mr. Cosby, you must attend these classes,â Cosby continued. âWhy? One word. Entrapment! My political beliefs, my actions of trying to humanize all races, genders, and religions landed me in this place surrounded by barb wire fencing, a room made of steel and iron. So, I now have a temporary residence that resembles the quarters of some of the Greatest Political Prisoners - Martin Luther King, Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Randal [sic] Robinson, and Dr. Benjamin Chavis. I stand upright as a Political Prisoner and I Smile. The Truth is Strong!â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The <a

href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/13/de-blasio-new-york-mayor-progressives-1098725\">declined</a> to rule out a presidential bid, rumors have swirled that <strong>Bill de Blasio</strong> is mulling a White House run. Now, perhaps feeling left out as virtually every Democrat with presidential ambitions takes their shot, the New York City mayor is officially testing the 2020 waters, poking around city hall in search of staffers with national experience and traveling to New Hampshire this week to bounce ideas off of voters in the early-primary state. âHe wants to make sure ideas like pre-K for all, paid personal time, and mental health are on the table as Democrats debate the partyâs vision for the future,â a de Blasio spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2019/02/11/de-blasio-heads-to-new-hampshire-as-he-contemplates-run-for-president-848323\">told</a> Politico.</p>\n<p>Itâs still far from certain that de Blasio will enter the race&#8212;as Politico notes, the 57-year-old Democrat has yet to establish a campaign team or a national donor network&#8212;but if he does, he would be the second sitting mayor to do so (South Bend, Indianaâs <strong>Pete Buttigieg</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/democrat-pete-buttigieg-joins-2020-race\">announced his exploration of candidacy</a> late last month). De Blasioâs name recognition likely ranks above Buttigiegâs, but heâd still be playing catch-up against candidates with far larger national profiles: <strong>Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker,</strong> and <strong>Kamala Harris,</strong> not to mention potential candidates like <strong>Bernie Sanders,</strong> the ever-popular <strong>Joe Biden,</strong> and a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/12/trump-beto-orourke-2020-1164647\">resurgent</a> <strong>Beto OâRourke.</strong></p>\n<p>As it stands, de Blasio isnât even particularly popular in New York City, where heâs <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/new-york-city/release-detail?ReleaseID=2589\">polling in the low 40s</a>&#8212;almost the same as <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/203207/trump-job-approval-weekly.aspx\"><strong>Donald Trump.</strong></a> As Politico notes, his handling of the cityâs problems&#8212;its exclusionary priciness, its growing homeless population, its public housing authority&#8212;would almost certainly cast a shadow over a national campaign, which some in city hall told the publication could distract him from his day job. A <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/06/guide-to-mayor-de-blasios-investigations.html\">series of scandals</a> over the past several years has also eroded the patina and high hopes with which de Blasio took office in 2014.</p>\n<p>But the Democratic Party has also begun to embrace the more progressive ideas that de Blasio has championed, leading some of his allies to believe he could have a shot. âItâs Bill de Blasioâs Democratic Party in 2020,â a person close to the mayor <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/01/will-bill-de-blasio-run-in-2020.html\">told</a> <em>New York</em> magazine last month. One former aide suggested de Blasioâs ambitions go no further than raising his national profile. âIs he running for president? No way. Itâs crazy,â the former aide said. âBut he has done the impossible thing, which is rise from the dead to make himself relevant again in the national conversation.â With enough positive reinforcement, however, he might just make the leap. âEveryone is making their move right now,â a political operative close to the mayor told <em>New York.</em> âEveryone wants to be relevant. If you are going to carve out your own real estate, now is the time to do it.â</p>","rubric":"2020","socialTitle":"Lord Help Us, Bill de Blasio Is Still Thinking About a 2020

Would Haley, a shining star in the Republican Party, run against <strong>Donald Trump</strong> in 2020? âAlarm bells going off in Trump world,â <strong>Bill Kristol,</strong> a conservative commentator and the founder of the now defunct <em>Weekly Standard</em> magazine, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/1094623089541955584\">wrote on Twitter</a>, suggesting that the former South Carolina governor could be âa possible replacement for Trump in 2020.â</p>\n<p>Kristol, of course, is the ur-Never-Trumper, and this was wishful thinking. Haley allies and G.O.P. strategists were quick to dismiss the speculation that the former ambassador would primary her former boss. âGuys like Bill Kristol are about as reliable as a broken Magic 8 Ball these days when it comes to politics,â <strong>Rob Godfrey,</strong> Haleyâs former deputy chief of staff and chief spokesperson, told me Monday.</p>\n<p>Certainly, under almost all circumstances, it would be foolish for Haley to challenge Trump. The president currently enjoys an <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx\">88 percent approval rating</a> among Republicans&#8212;all but guaranteeing that he will be the G.O.P. nominee, unless he leaves office or decides not to run. If she were to launch a primary bid, Haley would also squander all the good will with the presidentâs MAGA base sheâs worked so hard to build up in her two-year tenure in Turtle Bay. âThere is no environment in which she is going to run against Trump. That is her ticket,â one G.O.P. operative told me. âThat would be like <strong>Tom Brady</strong> trying to push out <strong>Bill Belichick</strong> . . . That would never happen.â</p>\n<p>Haley herself has been unequivocal in her support of Trump in 2020. But that doesnât mean sheâs not laying the groundwork for an Oval Office bid. It is hard to identify a Republican politician with greater star power than Haley. Her <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/30/ex-un-ambassador-nikki-haley-charging-200000-per-speaking-gig.html\">reported</a> $200,000 price tag for speaking events would suggest a high demand for the ambassador. Even among Democrats, she boasts a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/nikki-haley-most-popular-trump-administration-f3698066-76e3-462f-92cd-472e3c58ca7a.html\">55 percent approval rating</a>. And by the standards set after <strong>Mitt Romneyâs</strong> 2012 defeat, in a pre-Trump world, Haley&#8212;a daughter of immigrants; tough on bigotry with all the right politics&#8212;could be a vessel for a new Republican Party. âNikki Haley is one of the brightest stars that the Republican Party has and is somebody who has universal approval within the party,â <strong>Doug Heye,</strong> a former communications director for the Republican National Committee, told me. âAny talk in the 2020 context is making too much of this. What she does after that? I think it is up to her and she can go very, very far.â</p>\n<p>Singer, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/us/politics/trump-dossier-paul-singer.html\">fervent anti-Trumper in 2016</a>, is a useful, deep-pocketed friend to have in her corner. And a Haley-Singer alliance would certainly be symbiotic. During the 2016 election, the billionaire hedge-fund manager <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/18/billionaire-paul-singer-emerges-as-key-financial-ally-for-rubio-campaign-and-super-pac/\">threw millions behind</a> Haleyâs No. 1 draft pick in the Republican primary, Senator <strong>Marco Rubio.</strong> Notably, <strong>Jon Lerner,</strong> a Republican pollster who managed Haleyâs successful gubernatorial bid and served as one of her top aides at the United Nations, ran the pro-Rubio Conservative Solutions PAC during the 2016 cycle. âObviously, this is the first event of the Ambassadorâs 2024 presidential campaign,â <strong>Terry Sullivan,</strong> who worked as Rubioâs campaign manager, said of the Singer event.</p>\n<p>Nearly half a dozen G.O.P. sources agreed that Haley is well-positioned for the next election cycle. âSheâs almost certain to run for president in 2024, probably against Vice President <strong>[Mike] Pence,</strong> Governor <strong>[Greg] Abbott,</strong> and a slew of U.S. senators. It will be a feeding frenzy, not unlike the Democratic brawl we face currently,â said <strong>George Seay,</strong> a prominent Texas-based G.O.P. donor who also initially backed Rubio in the last presidential cycle. Of course, he cautioned, âThis is many years out.â</p>\n<p>While history would suggest that Pence would be first in the line of succession, there is a sense among some Republicans that his lapdog act has cost him, and the telegenic and compelling Haley would easily eclipse him in a crowded field. âNobody thinks that Mike Pence has availed himself very well to take the next step,â the G.O.P. operative told me. âHe might be [a 2024 candidate], but nobody respects his political juice because he looks like one of those service puppies that you take on an airplane.â</p>\n<p>Of course, there is a non-zero chance that Trump wonât be leading the Republican ticket in 2020. As <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> and his team of prosecutors tunnel out of the spotlight and newly empowered House Democrats probe everything from the presidentâs foreign ties to his son-in-lawâs security clearance, Trump faces an unprecedented level of scrutiny in his second two years in office&#8212;and no one knows where it might end. As Sullivan put it, âAnything is possible on the Trump Show.â</p>\n<p><em>This article has been updated.</em></p>","rubric":"2020","socialTitle":"âAnything Is Possibleâ: GOP Insiders See Haley in the White House ","socialDescription":"A primary challenge is likely out of the question.

Unlike <strong>Corey Lewandowski,</strong> who was hired to great consternation during the 2016 election cycle (and then terminated), Flores wonât simply be an ideological talking head&#8212;sheâll be playing a larger role in the editorial process. Despite a lack of journalism experience, she will <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/media/reliable-sources-02-19-19/\">be helping</a> to coordinate CNNâs political coverage across platforms, as well as <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/19/sessions-sarah-isgur-cnn-political-editor-1174527\">occasionally appearing on-air</a> as a political analyst, which is the more customary role for former politicians and government officials. Within the media world, she is seen as a controversial and unorthodox appointment. Moreover, Isgur apparently has a history of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/19/18231993/cnn-gop-operative-2020-election-coverage\">lambasting the mainstream media</a> on Twitter, including CNN, which she once termed the âClinton News Network.â</p>\n<p>All of this has led to a fair amount of bafflement as to why CNN would hire her in a senior editorial role reporting to political director <strong>David Chalian.</strong> âWhy CNN made this move to begin with is the deeper and more troubling question,â <strong>Margaret Sullivan</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/cnns-hiring-of-a-gop-operative-as-political-editor-is-even-worse-than-it-looks/2019/02/20/93d03fa4-350b-11e9-854a-7a14d7fec96a_story.html\">wrote</a> Wednesday in <em>The Washington Post.</em></p>\n<p>As far as how the talks came about in the first place, it appears that Isgur, as she was preparing to exit the D.O.J., wasnât only shopping around for a media gig at CNN. Cable-news sources told me that she also passed through 30 Rock to discuss a potential role at MSNBC, where she met with top newsroom management in recent months. âShe had a detailed idea of what she wanted to do,â someone with knowledge of the discussions told me. âShe wanted to do something on-air combined with some sort of quasi-management, behind-the-scenes planning kind of work. I think she looked at Dave Chalian and said, I wanna do that.â A second source with direct knowledge of the talks said that such a role âwas never under consideration.â This person added, âShe was pitching her intimate knowledge of the Mueller probe as a selling point.â (CNN has said that Isgur will have no role in any coverage related to Mueller or the Department of Justice.) MSNBC declined to comment, and CNN didnât immediately have a comment. Isgur didnât immediately return an e-mail, but after this article was initially published, a source close to her provided a different characterization, saying that anything related to Mueller was always off the table in Isgur&#39;s conversations with both MSNBC and CNN.</p>\n<p>My CNN sources corroborated the general sentiment thatâs been conveyed in <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/media/reliable-sources-02-19-19/\">other</a> news <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnn-staffers-demoralized-by-hiring-of-gop-operative-sarah-isgur-to-oversee-2020-coverage\">reports</a> about the episode: that journalists at the network are concerned and confused about the hire. âItâs perplexing to a lot of people,â one of them told me. But in a <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnn-defends-hiring-former-gop-operative-as-political-editor\">memo</a> to employees on Wednesday, three top CNN managers&#8212;Chalian, Washington bureau chief <strong>Sam Feist,</strong> and senior vice president of newsgathering <strong>Virginia Mosley</strong>&#8212;stood by the decision, saying they were âthrilledâ that Isgur was joining the network next month. âWith more than two dozen candidates to cover, constant coordination is needed more than ever,â they wrote.</p>\n<p>Likewise, unnamed CNN executives defended the move to <strong>Brian Stelter,</strong> the networkâs chief media correspondent. âThey described her [as] an exceptional person whose political experience will improve CNNâs coverage,â Stelter <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/media/reliable-sources-02-19-19/\">wrote</a>. âThe fact is, political insiders have been joining newsrooms for decades. The executives pointed to past examples like <strong>George Stephanopoulos,</strong> who went from [the] Clinton White House to the ABC News anchor chair.â A CNN source added to me, âShe is super-smart, has experience in the media, is a spokesperson who understands the media&#8212;seems like these are all good characteristics.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity

Writer-director <strong>Sofia Coppola</strong> and <strong>Bill Murray</strong> are teaming up again, this time for a film titled <em>On the Rocks.</em> The modern twist? According to <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/01/apple-a24-partner-on-first-film-sofia-coppola-bill-murray-reunion-on-the-rocks-1202535587/\">Deadline</a>, <em>On the Rocks</em> is set to be the first project from Apple and A24âs forthcoming film partnership.</p>\n<p>This is Coppola and Murrayâs third project together, after the 2003 drama <em>Lost in Translation</em>&#8212;which earned Coppola a screenplay Oscar and Murray an Oscar nomination&#8212;and the 2015 Netflix special <em>A Very Murray Christmas.</em> Per Deadline, <em>On the Rocks</em> will tell the story of a âyoung mother who reconnects with her larger-than-life playboy father on an adventure through New York.â <strong>Rashida Jones</strong> will also star in the film.</p>\n<p>Now letâs get back to the Apple and A24 of it all. The partnership between the two entities was announced <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/film/news/apple-a24-films-1203029800/\">last November</a>, with Apple declining to share broader details beyond the fact that it will be âa multi-year agreement.â Which, how dare they. Such an enticing partnership, such little information to go on!</p>\n<p>But this is now par for the course with Apple, which is making an aggressive move into the original-content space and has announced a mind-boggling slew of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/apple-tv-projects-list-full\">forthcoming projects</a> from powerhouses like <strong>Oprah, Steven Spielberg,</strong> and Reese Witherspoon.__ But there have been few revelations about when we, the hungry public, will actually see any of these projects on screens of our very own&#8212;or, for that matter, <em>how</em> we will see any of those projects. (Will the streaming service exist . . . within Apple TV? Or as its own app?) The same goes for its films; A24 opts for theatrical releases, so maybe Apple will, too&#8212;eschewing the <a

To hear the press tell it, she was â<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/well-id-like-to-be-president-hillary-clinton-sends-mixed-signals-on-a-2020-white-house-bid/2018/10/29/d17257a0-db6c-11e8-85df-7a6b4d25cfbb_story.html\">sending mixed signals</a>,â and â<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/413572-hillary-clinton-leaves-door-open-for-2020-run-id-like-to-be-president\">leaving the door open</a>,â characterizations Swisher herself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1056924474367533059\">took issue with</a>. Yet for some reason, rumors continue to swirl around Clinton, inspired by an errant word from a longtime adviser <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/10/19/hillary-clinton-democrats-go-away-2018-2020-221608\">here</a>, a trolling <em>Wall Street Journal</em> op-ed <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-will-run-again-1541963599?ns=prod/accounts-wsj\">there</a>. Most recently, CNNâs <strong>Jeff Zeleny</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/27/politics/inside-politics-forecast-cnntv/index.html\">reported</a> on that Clinton was once again floating a candidacy to her friends: â[S]he was telling people that look, given all this news from the indictments, particularly the <strong>Roger Stone</strong> indictment, she talked to several people, saying âlook, Iâm not closing the doors to this,ââ he said, adding that other associates still were dubious. (Said one: âit would surprise me greatly if she actually did it.â)</p>\n<p>This, said <strong>John Podesta,</strong> Clintonâs 2016 campaign manager, is nonsense. âLook, first of all, I love her, I wish she was president, she got 3 million more votes than <strong>Donald Trump</strong> did, she would have been a great president,â he <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2020-presidential-election-hillary-clinton-not-running-podesta-070ef325-dd68-480e-98ea-99ebd619d047.html\">said</a> on CNN Tuesday. âBut she says sheâs not running for president.â</p>\n<p>âI take her at her word,â he continued, adding that the Democratic Party has âgot a lot of great candidates out there right now, and I think the Democratic primaryâ&#8212;already a crowded affair&#8212;âis going to be a spirited one with a lot of great ideas coming forward.â He dismissed the narrative that Clinton was mulling another presidential run as âmedia catnip.â</p>\n<p>Indeed, there seems to be something irresistible to the media in the idea of Clinton resurfacing. Perhaps itâs simply difficult to imagine that arguably the most qualified candidate to ever run for president is content at the prospect of spending her days <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/deals/gl-lnc-the-clintons-la-2019\">selling speaking tour tickets on Groupon</a>, or even, as Podesta described, visiting Puerto Rico to âhelp the people that Donald Trump has abandonedâ as the island recovers from Hurricane Maria. Whatever the reason, each new story in the genre is met with an inevitable backlash. The response to the <em>Journal</em> op-ed is a prime example: âPlease, Hillary, Donât Do It,â two CNN contributors <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/opinions/hillary-2020-prospect-opinion-honan-wierson/index.html\">wrote in panicked response</a>, while <strong>Chris Cilizza</strong> devoted <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T9hcFrD6Ns\">six-and-a-half minutes</a> to calling it a âterrible idea,â and <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/no-hillary-clinton-wont-be-the-2020-democratic-nominee.html\">countless</a> <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/a-request-to-mark-penn-andy-stein-and-any-other-so-called-democrats-talking-up-clinton-2020-respectfully-shut-up\">hot</a> <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/807216/hillary-2020-cannot-serious\">takes</a> <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/418137-foxs-pirro-to-clinton-on-2020-the-only-place-that-you-need-to-run-is-back-into\">emerged</a> panning possibility. (The one exception was Trump White House adviser <strong>Kellyanne Conway,</strong> who tweeted: <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/conway-jokes-about-prediction-hillary-clinton-will-run-again-in-2020-1.6640531\">âDear God, please, yes.â</a>)</p>\n<p>But the myth of Clinton as leader-in-exile will persist as long as she remains a public figure, buoyed both by people who believe she wouldâve won in 2016 save for a few targeted Russian hacks, and by those who see rumors about her potential run as a characteristic display of unalloyed ambition and hubris. The Clinton persona has become symbolic of the rift in the Democratic Party that paved the way for Trumpism, and rumors of her return are all but guaranteed to trigger meltdowns.</p>\n<h3>More Great

But that doesnât mean that no woman will pass it, or that disliking a certain woman stems solely from misogyny.","body":"<p>From time to time, the political press propagates a thought that, whatever its validity, dominates the discourse. Itâs akin to a spontaneous combustion, and the truism it produces lasts until the next one comes along. As in: <strong>Amy Klobucharâs</strong> two-and-a-half-minute exchange with <strong>Brett Kavanaugh</strong> about his drinking habits gave instant rise to the widespread conclusion that she should be the Democratic nominee.</p>\n<p>And no sooner had <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> entered the race in late December than the question of whether sheâs âlikableâ was immediately interpreted as misogynistic.</p>\n<p>Warrenâs talents as a campaigner were evident in her foray into Iowa during the first week of January. Sheâs quite skilled at drilling down to a simple, comprehensible point, usually having to do with economic justice. Her anecdotes go over well. For example, in Iowa she told the story of getting in touch with Iowa Republican Senator <strong>Chuck Grassley,</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/bipartisan-over-the-counter-hearing-aid-legislation-to-become-law\">working with him</a> to get a bill through Congress that lowered the cost of hearing aids. (Cheers and applause.) Sheâs earned bragging rights for having spawned the idea&#8212;before she entered the Senate&#8212;of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to protect individuals from scams in credit cards, mortgages, and loans. The new agency was relatively successful, until the Trump administration took over and began to de-fang it.</p>\n<p>But thereâs another aspect to Warrenâs economic populism&#8212;one that makes her less than popular among her Senate colleagues. This friction has nothing to do with Warren being a woman in politics, or displaying political ambition&#8212;just as much of what bothered people about <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> had nothing to do with her gender. For an explanation of what it is about Warren that perturbs her colleagues, I sought out an observant former Senate Democratic aide of many yearsâ standing. What he said echoed comments and stories Iâd heard from senators and reporters whoâve dealt with Warren. âShe projects a âholier than thouâ attitude that her colleagues find irritating. Sheâs very doctrinaire. Sheâs somewhat âMy way or the highwayâ&#8212;not as much as <strong>Bernie Sanders,</strong> but up there,â he said. âShe has a moralizing to her . . . She rails against Wall Street, which may be appealing to some people, but itâs too simplistic to work as an analysis. But sheâs very good at finding issues that resonate with middle Americans,â he added, citing the hearing-aid story. He went on: âSheâs a little aloof; sheâs strong in her convictions, unwilling to bend.â</p>\n<p>He then offered a comparison between Warren and Clinton as senators. Of Warren he said, âSheâs never tried very hard to make friends there. Compare that to Hillary: She knew coming into the Senate that she was viewed by many there as the devil incarnate, and she kept her head down and worked to make friends on both sides of the aisle.â</p>\n<p>Of course, despite her best efforts, the âunlikableâ tag has also been attached to Clinton. What bothered many people (women, as well as men) about Clinton was that she gave off an attitude of entitlement&#8212;the tin ear and air of superiority that led her to label half of <strong>Donald Trumpâs</strong> supporters âa basket of deplorables.â That misogyny dogged Clinton is without question, but some of her own personality traits were responsible for the way she was seen by a substantial segment of the public.</p>\n<p>The fact that Warrenâs likability, like Clintonâs, has been questioned has led numerous observers to conclude that no woman in politics can overcome criticism based on her gender. Thatâs nonsense. After all, a <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/12/18/record-number-women-in-congress/\">record</a> 102 women were elected to the House of Representatives in 2018. (The previous House record was 85 women.) Republicans simply havenât made the same effort that Democrats have to bring women into their ranks, with the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/12/18/record-number-women-in-congress/\">result</a> that women now represent 8 percent of House Republicans, as opposed to 38 percent of the Democratic caucus. (Democrats also stressed diversity, and sought out candidates of both genders whoâd served in the military.) In the Senate, midterms plus the appointment to fill the remainder of John McCainâs term, added 15 women, for a total of 25 women senators; previously, the <a href=\"http://cawp.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/resources/results_release_5bletterhead5d_1.pdf\">record</a> was 23. Two incumbent women senators lost to men on clear substantive issues. Midterms also saw women pick up gubernatorial seats, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/opinion/election-michigan-women-stabenow-whitmer.html\">four of the top statewide offices</a> in Michigan. A black woman fell just short of winning the governorship of Georgia, overtaken at least in part by the fact that her opponent was also the secretary of state who set and twisted the rules of the race. The direction is clear. A country that couldnât see women through other than a misogynistic lens wouldnât produce such results.</p>\n<p>Another way to look at Warrenâs situation in Congress is to compare it to that of <strong>Nancy Pelosi,</strong> as House Speaker far and away the most powerful woman on Capitol Hill, if not in all of Washington. Despite the attacks on her in national politics&#8212;the right charges her with being a âSan Francisco liberal,â though in fact sheâs a product of the brass-knuckle politics of Baltimore, where her father was the boss-mayor&#8212;Pelosiâs colleagues donât raise the issue of her likability. Under pressure from their Republican opponents, some Democrats running for the House for the first time pledged not to support her for Speaker (though not all of them held to this promise). But no serious challenge developed. It was clear, as she skillfully dispatched possible rivals&#8212;who said it was time for fresh blood in the Democratic leadership&#8212;that Pelosi is admired by most of the men as well as the women in the Democratic caucus for her legislative smarts and her toughness wrapped in a certain grace. Several said that Pelosi was just who was needed to deal with Donald Trump. She met the argument of those who said she should make way for younger leadership by agreeing to step down from the Speakership after four more years. The contrasting cases of Warren and Pelosi show that people&#8212;both men and women&#8212;are capable of making distinctions among women in politics.</p>\n<p>The question arises: What does likability matter in politics? Does it&#8212;should it&#8212;matter at all, if someone can get elected? In fact, it counts for a lot in determining whether a political figure can work effectively with others&#8212;whether she or he can build coalitions&#8212;or can lead the public. A politician whom large numbers of people find grating simply has a harder time leading the country. This is one reason I donât complain about the length of presidential campaigns: It usually helps sort out who will wear well. Usually. The fact that Trump is disliked by a majority of the country has been one factor getting in the way of his possible effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Itâs undeniable that, while women have been making headlong progress in politics, as well as in some other professional fields, they still carry an extra burden. The double standard still exists: A man who speaks out strongly or objects to something a male boss has done is âstrong,â âtough.â A woman who does the same thing is likely to be termed âdifficult.â That word, âdifficult,â stated or insinuated, haunts women in the workplace. Fortunately, an increasing proportion of men have enough inner strength or are sufficiently enlightened that they deal with women the same way they do men. Sexism in the workplace and in politics may be fading, but not quickly enough.</p>\n<p>At least for a while longer, women in certain fields will endure a different kind of test than men do&#8212;or an additional one. But that doesnât mean that no woman will pass it, that itâs the only test applied to women candidates, that people canât make distinctions, or that disliking a certain woman stems solely from misogyny. Nor does it mean that, like men, women canât find a female candidate wanting on other grounds.</p>\n<p>Misogyny can certainly affect women in politics, but theyâll also be judged on other factors on a case-by-case basis. Other female candidates warming up for the race warrant scrutiny for other traits. Ultimately, candidates of both genders must grapple with the valid question of âlikability,â which will help answer a far more important question: How will they govern?</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The real story behind the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/the-real-story-behind-the-havana-embassy-mystery?inline\">Havana embassy sonic âattacksâ</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Meet 2019âs <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/politics-power-players-portfolio?inline\">political power players</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is the left lane big enough for both <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/why-bernie-sanders-and-elizabeth-warren-are-the-closest-of-frenemies?inline\">Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; What the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/what-the-left-can-learn-from-the-maga-cult?inline\">left can learn from MAGA</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The pop-culture releases that will <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/pop-culture-shows-movies-2019?inline\">save us in 2019</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Elizabeth Warren","socialTitle":"âShe Has a Moralizing to Herâ: Is Elizabeth Warren Actually âUnlikeable?â","socialDescription":"Women in certain fields endure a different kind of test than men doâor an additional one.

Jean-Georges.","body":"<p>When it was clear that the <strong>Duchess of Sussex</strong> had made it to N.Y.C., the only question left was, how luxe would her baby shower be? With <strong>Serena Williamsâs</strong> help, Meghan Markle is having a baby shower for the ages Wednesday, including a flower-arranging lesson and multi-dessert meal.</p>\n<p>The duchess, who is seven months pregnant, is enjoying a break with some of her closest friends&#8212;the ones she hung around before her wedding&#8212;before she heads to Morocco later this week for an official trip with the duke. Since arriving in New York, she has enjoyed tea and macarons at her favorite SoHo bakery, LadurÃ©e, a spot of shopping for baby clothing at Bonpoint, a trip to the Met Breuer museum, and a long lunch at the Surrey hotel.</p>\n<p>The paparazzi shots of her leaving the hotel, where crowds of onlookers had gathered, were reminiscent of the pictures we used to see of Meghan before she became a royal, albeit with a slightly bigger security entourage. A team of five bodyguards, including State Department security, are in charge of protecting the duchess. In oversize sunglasses and black, Meghan looked thrilled to be stepping back into her old stilettos.</p>\n<p>By having a shower at all, she is embracing an American tradition despite her new Anglophile life. Those close to Meghan point out that the baby shower is yet another way of her showing that she plans to do things her own way, royal or not. âAs an American, she was very excited to have a baby shower thrown for her. I think sheâd have felt she was missing out if she didnât have one,â says a source. âItâs been such a fun time for her, she is with her oldest friends in the city she loves and really enjoying herself.â</p>\n<p>While the duchess was reported to have celebrated her baby shower Tuesday, the party is actually taking place Wednesday at the Upper East Side hotel the Mark. The celebration is was organized by Williams, who has apparently booked out the penthouse suite, which is spread over two floors and features five bedrooms, four fire places, six bathrooms, and two powder rooms, plus views over Central Park.</p>\n<p>Among the guests will be newly engaged <strong>Misha Nonoo</strong> and Meghanâs best friend, stylist <strong>Jessica Mulroney,</strong> who flew to New York from L.A. earlier this week. According to <em>Tatler,</em> <a href=\"https://www.tatler.com/article/inside-meghan-markles-baby-shower\">Williams is personally covering the cost</a> of the $75,000-a-night room bill.</p>\n<p>The shower will begin with a flower-arranging lesson accompanied by a dessert-tasting experience overseen by the in-house restaurantâs head chef, <strong>Jean-Georges Vongerichten.</strong> Meghanâs college friend <strong>Lindsay Roth</strong> will also be at the shower along with her former co-star <strong>Abigail Spencer, Priyanka Chopra, Benita Litt,</strong> and <strong>Markus Anderson.</strong></p>\n<p>The duchess is understood to have flown out to the U.S. on a private jet, which is estimated to have cost over $100,000. However, the plane belongs to one of Meghanâs close friends in Toronto, who covered the cost as a present for Meghan.

former-presidential-candidate spouses enjoy a good date night on the town. On Tuesday evening, <strong>Hillary</strong> and <strong>Bill Clinton,</strong> among a slew of other famous names, headed to the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre in Manhattan for the opening night of <em>Choir Boy,</em> written by <em>Moonlight</em> scribe <strong>Tarell Alvin McCraney.</strong> The Clintons hammed it up for photographers, smiling and showing off the playbill. <strong>Cynthia Erivo,</strong> <strong>Debra Messing,</strong> <strong>Phylicia Rashad,</strong> and more also joined for the playâs debut.</p>\n<p>Hillary has kept a relatively low profile as of late, giving the occasional speech and responding to <strong>Donald Trumpâs</strong> presidency online. But in a show of her much-discussed superhuman work ethic, she took to Twitter once the play was over. She wrote about Trumpâs Oval Office address and his hopes for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1083029073230729218\">series of tweets</a>, disputing what she called a âridiculousâ speech.</p>\n<p>âThe only border crisis weâre facing is the inhumane detention of kids that has already led to the deaths of two children,â she wrote, linking to an ActBlue charity fund.</p>\n<p>She added: âWeâve raised over $100k and counting for organizations that help families and kids at the border since the beginning of the presidentâs TV stunt last night. Letâs keep counteracting his lies about migrants and refugees with positive action.â</p>\n<p>Hillary also <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/the-new-congressional-class-set-a-high-style-bar\">showed support</a> for the women sworn into Congress last week, the most in United States history, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1080941776377180160\">writing</a>, âTo the women sworn in to Congress today, the most in our history: Congratulations.

before, but one of <strong>Donald Trumpâs</strong> most shocking claims about a southern border wall has proven a bit exaggerated. The president claimed in Fridayâs bizarre Rose Garden presser that several of his predecessors âhave told me that we should haveâ built a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, though he declined to name which former presidents supported it. Perhaps unsurprisingly, representatives for the Bush family and <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> have denied the allegation.</p>\n<p>âThis should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me, and they all know it,â Trump said. âSome of them have told me that we should have done it.â</p>\n<p>Clinton spokesperson <strong>Angel UreÃ±a</strong> explicitly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/04/trump-former-presidents-border-wall-1082562\">refuted</a> the presidentâs assertion, adding that the two men have ânot talked since the inauguration.â Bush representative <strong>Freddy Ford</strong> said the wall has never been discussed between the two. Former president George H.W. Bush <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/george-hw-bush-dead-at-94\">died in November</a>, though it is seen as unlikely that he and Trump had any significant discussion of a wall. Trump has famously kept his distance from the Bush family in the wake of past comments and a 2016 presidential campaign rivalry with <strong>Jeb Bush.</strong> Trump did not attend the funeral of former First Lady Barbara Bush in April.</p>\n<p>That just leaves former presidents <strong>Barack Obama</strong> and <strong>Jimmy Carter,</strong> both of whom have criticized Trumpâs positions on immigration. An Obama spokesperson reportedly declined comment, though Obama himself has come out against the wall on numerous occasions. Carter, like Obama, has pushed for technological advancements to strengthen U.S. border security, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/trump-wall-shutdown.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, but not the kind of wall that Trump is seeking $5 billion to build. A senior administration official reportedly suggested that Trump was âreferring to public comments his predecessors have made about the need for border security, not necessarily for a wall specifically.â</p>","rubric":"Wall Tales","socialTitle":"Former Presidents Deny Supporting Border Wall, Despite Trump Claims","socialDescription":"Neither Bush nor Clinton ever shared Trumpâs

","familyName":"Bloomberg","bio":"For the majority of Americans, Michael Bloomberg will be known as the guy who tried to ban large sodas from New York City. But for the residents of New York, and the power brokers of the world, Bloomberg is a multi-disciplinary juggernaut, and perhaps the Rockefeller or Carnegie of the 21st century: a titan of finance, a media mogul, and the man who transformed the Big Apple during his unprecedented three terms as mayor. Heâs also one of the top 10 wealthiest individuals in the world. As of 2016, according to <em>Forbes,</em> Bloomberg is worth $44.1 billion.\n<p>Raised in a middle-class family in Medford, Massachusetts, outside Boston, Bloomberg could have been content as a self-made billionaire, his fortune made from selling and curating real-time financial information on the Bloomberg terminal&#8212;the lifeblood of any Wall Street professionalâs very existence. But in 2001, the lifelong Democrat became a Republican, poured $73 million of his own money into his campaign, won the endorsement of Rudy Giuliani, and became the mayor of New York City.</p>\n<p>Thus began Bloombergâs controversial journey into public life, marked by extreme highs and lows. He advocated for the development of parks and bike lanes, banned smoking in restaurants, and implemented new food regulations to combat obesity. (One regulation attempted to ban large sodas more than 16 ounces, one of the many policies that led people to accuse him of turning the city into a nanny state.) During the 2008 economic crisis, he argued that he needed to have a third term to guide the finance-dependent city through the years of turbulence ahead. His exacting management style turned post-9/11 New York City, a town left for broke decades earlier, into essentially one of the worldâs greatest businesses, a gleaming metropolis with plummeting crime rates, skyrocketing wealth, renewed real-estate development, and an ominous undercurrent of gentrification, the targeting of minority men with stop-and-frisk, and widening income inequality.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg has always been well meaning, even if his measures appear out of touch with reality: after he settled into a post-mayoral career of anti-gun activism and philanthropy, he had the urge to go back into public life, considering a run for president when the unpopular <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> seemed to be the two candidates headed for the general election. But his trial balloon never quite took off. âI love our country too much to play a role in electing a candidate who would weaken our unity and darken our future&#8212;and so I will not enter the race for president of the United States,â he wrote on Bloomberg View, the opinion section of Bloomberg News, probably the most apt outlet in which he could have made the announcement.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1050,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":103,"height":700,"width":1050}}},"5:3":{"width":1165,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":117,"width":1165,"height":699}}},"2:3":{"width":466,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":467,"width":466,"height":699}}},"16:9":{"width":1232,"height":693,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":84,"width":1232,"height":693}}},"4:3":{"width":932,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":234,"width":932,"height":699}}},"1:1":{"width":700,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":350,"width":700,"height":700}}},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/24/5744ac62614dc9a45cb0adf8_hive-contributor-profile-mike-bloomberg.jpg","width":1400,"height":700}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 24, 2016 3:33 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-mike-bloomberg.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-mike-bloomberg.jpg","credit":"By Mark Wilson/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5744ac61c1f81aa45c811816","createdAt":"May 24, 2016 3:32 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 24, 2016 3:33 pm","description":"Getty: 468907412","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/michael-bloomberg","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1050,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":103,"height":700,"width":1050}}},"5:3":{"width":1165,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":117,"width":1165,"height":699}}},"2:3":{"width":466,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":467,"width":466,"height":699}}},"16:9":{"width":1232,"height":693,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":84,"width":1232,"height":693}}},"4:3":{"width":932,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":234,"width":932,"height":699}}},"1:1":{"width":700,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":350,"width":700,"height":700}}},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/24/5744ac62614dc9a45cb0adf8_hive-contributor-profile-mike-bloomberg.jpg","width":1400,"height":700}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 24, 2016 3:33 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-mike-bloomberg.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-mike-bloomberg.jpg","credit":"By Mark Wilson/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5744ac61c1f81aa45c811816","createdAt":"May 24, 2016 3:32 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 24, 2016 3:33 pm","description":"Getty: 468907412","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"57362957ff97be4071973df5","revision":4,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/michael-bloomberg"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Bloomberg Threatens to Drop $500 Million 2020 Carpet Bomb","promoHed":"Bloomberg Threatens to Drop $500 Million 2020 Carpet Bomb","dek":"The Democratic billionaire could transform the presidential race&#8212;whether he runs or not.","promoDek":"The Democratic billionaire could transform the presidential race&#8212;whether he runs or not.","body":"<p>With a net worth that hovers around <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/#480cb18c1417\">$50 billion</a>, <strong>Michael Bloomberg</strong> is by far the highest-rolling potential 2020 candidate, towering over President <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> and even self-declared person-of-means <strong>Howard Schultz.</strong> The former mayor hasnât hesitated to throw his weight around, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/michael-bloomberg-100-million-2020-presidential-race\">hinting</a> that he might spend around $100 million to buy an advantage in the race, and shelling out donations to Democrats in the midterms. On Wednesday, however, Bloomberg upped the ante with a Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/13/michael-bloomberg-trump-2020-1167159\">report</a> that he would spend at <em>least</em> $500 million in 2020 to defeat Trump&#8212;whether or not he runs.</p>\n<p>Half a billion dollars is an ungodly amount by any metric. Thatâs roughly $175 million more than Trump spent in 2016, and outstrips the $129 million <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-reelection-effort-raised-21-million-in-the-fourth-quarter-campaign-says/2019/01/31/6e2a736a-2588-11e9-ad53-824486280311_story.html\">currently</a> sitting in the presidentâs re-election war chest. And that might just be the beginning: â[$500 million] will get us through the first few months,â Bloomberg adviser <strong>Kevin Sheekey</strong> told Politico. âMike spent $100 million in his last New York City election. And you can do the math as you think more broadly but New York City is 3 percent of the national population.â</p>\n<p>As Democratic operatives briefed on Bloombergâs operation told Politico, the billionaire philanthropist has earmarked said pile of money with two plans in mind. Plan A, obviously, is a presidential run as a Democrat. Plan B is bowing out of the race, but launching a massive parallel, data-driven campaign on behalf of the Democrats. According to internal polls, plan A could still pan out. âWhen people learn about his involvement in climate-change activism and gun safety, and when they learn that heâs not just a billionaire&#8212;but he came from a middle-class background and his dad never earned more than $6,000 a year, and you talk about the work heâs done on the ground and his philanthropy&#8212;Dem primary voters view him favorably,â said one Democrat familiar with the polling, adding that 80 percent of Democratic primary voters respond positively to Bloombergâs biography.</p>\n<p>Still, the chances that Bloomberg wins the Democratic nomination are slim. His multi-year flirtation with running for president has never exactly caught the publicâs imagination. Even now, after dropping $100 million on midterm races and continuing to fund gun-control efforts, Bloomberg is a dark horse: according to <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html#polls\">RealClearPolitics</a>, he polls an average 4.5 percent among Democratic candidates, with <strong>Joe Biden,</strong> his <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/indecision-2020-mike-bloombergs-presidential-dream-springs-eternal\">primary rival</a> for the centrist vote, field-stripping him by double digits. And that number is sure to fall as the field expands. In an election year in which Democrats are focused on identity politics and debating whether they should <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/opinion/abolish-billionaires-tax.html\">abolish billionaires</a> altogether, a 76-year-old white man with an eleven-figure net worth isnât exactly a shoe-in.</p>\n<p>That leaves plan B, which seems carefully calculated to earn Bloomberg maximum goodwill. After promoting his favored policies in the Democratic primary&#8212;including strict gun-control measures&#8212;Bloomberg could easily pass his $500 million apparatus on to the nominee. That heâs publicizing plan B at all is an indication heâs eager to avoid the label of Schultz-style spoiler. â[His] priority No. 1 is Trump doesnât get re-elected in 2020,â a Bloomberg insider <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/indecision-2020-mike-bloombergs-presidential-dream-springs-eternal\">told</a> my colleague <strong>Chris Smith</strong> earlier this month. âObviously, who else is running is a part of that. What the polls say is a part of that. But I wouldnât say thereâs one thing heâs looking for to make his decision.â Ultimately, Bloombergâs massive fortune gives him a layer of insulation: even if he drops out, heâll earn bragging rights for launching a full-scale attack against the most unpopular president in the modern era.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping,

More significantly, and tragically, it will also mark the one-year anniversary of the Parkland shooting, in which 17 Florida high-school students and staff members were murdered. It will also be <strong>Michael Bloombergâs</strong> 77th birthday.</p>\n<p>The confluence of those last two events could make February 14 the perfect moment for Bloomberg to announce he is running for president, particularly because the tech billionaire and three-term New York City mayor has spent tens of millions of dollars of his own money fighting against the proliferation of guns. And his political team discussed the possibility of a February 14 announcement. One problem, though: Bloomberg still hasnât made up his mind about whether he wants to become a candidate.</p>\n<p>This is the latest lap around the presidential-indecision track for Bloomberg. The biggest difference, so far, is that in 2008 and 2012, it was his Wall Street friends and political strategists pushing him to run. This time, Bloomberg himself initiated the exploration, in June 2018, in the wake of President <strong>Donald Trumpâs</strong> harsh crackdown on illegal immigration. Bloombergâs enthusiasm hasnât dimmed since then. Last fall, he reregistered as a Democrat, after equally pragmatic stretches as a Republican and as an independent, and he spent more than $100 million helping the party reclaim a House majority. To Bloomberg insiders, however, the strongest sign of his seriousness has been his ongoing willingness to travel and mix it up with rank-and-file voters. Bloomberg has visited obvious, high-profile early-primary states including Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, but heâs also made appearances at events in unglamorous Camden, New Jersey, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, ostensibly to hand out $2 million in grants for public arts projects, but also to take the Democratic temperature. âHeâs felt pretty good coming out of these things,â a Bloomberg insider says. âBut his priority No. 1 is Trump doesnât get re-elected in 2020. Obviously, who else is running is a part of that. What the polls say is a part of that. But I wouldnât say thereâs one thing heâs looking for to make his decision.â</p>\n<p>Indeed, Bloomberg is trying to calculate two things: whether he can have more influence on the issues he cares about by spending his money or by running for office&#8212;and, if he runs, whether he has a viable shot at winning the Democratic nomination. The hostile reaction to <strong>Howard Schultzâs</strong> independent-bid trial balloon was viewed, in Bloombergâs camp, as underscoring the Democratic determination to beat Trump, not as a rejection of billionaire businessman candidates. Bloombergâs team has weighed how his chances might change with different timelines: on the one hand, Bloomberg, unlike conventional politicians, doesnât need to raise money, so he can wait as long as he likes and see how the field develops. On the other, a later entry makes recruiting field staff harder, and allows a front-runner to gain momentum.</p>\n<p>Another significant factor is <strong>Joe Biden.</strong> Born nine months apart, Bloomberg and Biden have followed dramatically different paths to arrive at the same point, with money now playing an enormous, divergent role in their presidential campaign decisions. Biden, after some 40 years on the public payroll, is making real money for the first time in his life and providing well for his extended family; does he sacrifice that security after two unsuccessful presidential bids? Bloomberg, by contrast, has been fabulously wealthy for decades and could drop $500 million on a 50-state launch without flinching. A losing run would barely alter his bank account or his legacy.</p>\n<p>Having two older, white, male, moderate-ish contenders in the field would likely hurt them both. So Bloomberg and Biden have been doing a peculiar dance, keeping a close eye on one another while acting as if they donât care what the other decides. The two men crossed paths on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, giving speeches at Reverend <strong>Al Sharptonâs</strong> commemoration in Washington, D.C.; neither mentioned their potential candidacy. Both have kept their outreach to potential Iowa field staff to a minimum, even as <strong>Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker,</strong> and other declared contenders rapidly stock their campaign teams. âWeâve got a really strong field already,â says <strong>Norm Sterzenbach,</strong> the former executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party. âPeople are looking forward&#8212;we donât need the savior, the elder statesman, to set us on the right course. Though Bloomberg would start in a good place, because competency is going to be a big argument, given the president we have now.â</p>\n<p>Last week, when a flurry of stories appeared detailing how Bloomberg, even if he didnât run, would deploy his data operation to defeat Trump, a rival Democratic strategist interpreted it as a sign the Bloomberg team had picked up intelligence indicating Biden had decided to run. Bloombergâs associates say they donât have any inside knowledge of what Biden will do. And they donât believe the former mayor is deferring to the former vice president, either intentionally or subconsciously, even though Bidenâs decision would provide another highly valuable data point. âMike still has an engineerâs brain,â one colleague says. Yet Bloombergâs heart has been in this one far more than in previous flirtations&#8212;certainly because of his disgust with Trump, but also because that looming birthday is a stark reminder that if he doesnât take a shot at the White House now, he never will.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is Americaâs most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>âs 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, TimothÃ©e Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Politics","socialTitle":"Indecision 2020: Will Bloombergâs Presidential Dreams End with Biden?","socialDescription":"Insiders say the billionaire dreams of crushing Trump, but is calculating whether he can win: âMike still has an engineerâs brain.â","seoTitle":"Indecision 2020: Mike Bloombergâs Presidential Dream Springs Eternal.

discrimination?","promoDek":"Isnât criticizing the rich just anti-billionaire discrimination?","body":"<p>The past few weeks have been extremely tough on billionaires. Democratic lawmakers have <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/davos-billionaires-aoc-tax-proposal\">proposed</a> tax plans that could take them from âinsanely, mind-bogglingly richâ to simply âabsurdly rich.â One of their brethren announced he was seriously considering running for president in 2020, and instead of throwing him a parade and saying, âThank god you got here when you did!â, people <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/mike-bloomberg-howard-schultz-2020\">told him</a> he was making a horrible mistake. A single individual was <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/427674-historian-accuses-billionaires-at-davos-of-not-paying-their-fair-share-in\">mean to them at Davos</a>. Not one of them was invited to the State of the Union to highlight the epidemic of billionaire bullying. Obviously, this isnât the sort of treatment billionaires signed up for when they entered the âfuck-ton of moneyâ tax bracket, the contract for which specifically states they are to be exclusively praised and lionized for their wealth&#8212;a covenant that has been been violated in the most perverse of ways of late.  Luckily, a few brave souls&#8212;a kind of Freedom Riders, but for billionaires&#8212;are finally standing up and saying, enough. <em>The oppression must end.</em></p>\n<p>At Bloomberg, owned by billionaire <strong>Mike Bloomberg,</strong> columnist <strong>Tyler Cowen</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-07/stop-demeaning-billionaires-such-as-howard-schultz\">believes</a> we should stop demeaning billionaires by calling them billionaires, because in doing so we are âobjectifyingâ them. Itâs rude, he argued, to âcasually describe individuals by their net wealth,â which is âoften a preliminary step toward making others seem less human or less deserving of respect.â He went on:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I would hesitate, for example, before referring to someone publicly as âin the $150,000 range of net wealth,â even if most people knew that to be true. If I were a real-estate broker, I might talk about a customer this way, but it would be in a private context with another broker. Even then, calling someone âmy $350,000 customerâ or some such isnât something that would endear me to Miss Manners.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You might feel it is different when a personâs net wealth is very high, such as when the word âbillionaireâ is deployed. But that distinction does not sit easy with me. If we use the word âbillionaireâ for this reason, then arenât we also sending a negative message about the non-billionaires? At any rate, the people mocking <strong>[Howard] Schultz</strong> the most do not seem to be trying to give the word âbillionaireâ positive connotations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, one of the reasons people have been using the term âbillionaireâ derisively when describing the Starbucks C.E.O. is because they have an issue with the fact that the only reason heâd be able to get into the 2020 race (and likely give us <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-07/schultz-s-independent-bid-in-2020-would-help-trump-poll-finds\">another four years of <strong>Donald Trump</strong></a>) is because of his vast wealth. Another, perhaps, is that Schultz has come out against proposals like that of Rep. <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,</strong> with such declarations as, âI donât think we want a 70 percent income tax in America.â That Schultz should be demonized for this, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/whos-afraid-of-howard-schultz-11548893911\">argues</a> <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>âs editorial board, is tantamount to treason:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Democrats might benefit from re-acquainting themselves with the private economy and wealth creation, which is damaged by punitive taxation. Mr. Schultz could point this out in debates and note how the success of Starbucks allowed him to provide thousands of Americans with jobs, good health care, and the $30 million to help veterans navigate the workforce that Mr. Schultz has written about in these pages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Elsewhere in recent pleas to stop being so mean to the rich, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>âs <strong>Jason L. Riley,</strong> enraged that billionaire <strong>Ken Griffinâs</strong> purchase of the most expensive home in U.S. history received news coverage, bravely declared that â<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-billionaire-spends-his-money-is-his-own-business-11548807054\">how a billionaire spends his money is his own business</a>.â (In what weâre sure was an innocent omission, the article did not mention the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hedge-funds-got-bailout-bucks-too-2009-3\">$200 million</a> Griffinâs hedge fund received in taxpayer bailout funds during the financial crisis.) Meanwhile, the <em>Journal</em> also thinks itâs the height of unfair that, if weâre going to allow âidentity politicsâ to play a part in the next presidential election, one can â<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-love-diversity-except-when-it-comes-to-thought-11549411119\">identify as black</a>â but not as a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/grande-vs-keurig-billionaires-11548978810\">billionaire</a>, because itâs become such a dirty word.</p>\n<p>And yet, there may be hope. Perhaps, if the moniker is reclaimed to denote âgenius, altruist, better than everyone else on earth,â things could change. Itâll take a lot of work&#8212;marches, demonstrations, brave souls who arenât afraid to speak up&#8212;but itâll be worth it, to tell our children we didnât stand in silence.</p>\n<h3>More

running for president, from one billionaire to another.","body":"<p>In an interview with <em>The New York Times</em> published on Sunday, <strong>Howard Schultz</strong>, who unleashed Pumpkin Spice Lattes on the masses, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/howard-schultz-president-2020.html\">confirmed</a> what many have long suspected: he firmly believes the 2020 presidential race could use another billionaire candidate who hasnât so much as served as a congressional intern, and heâs <em>this close</em> to announcing that he is that very billionaire, having âalready begun the groundwork required to be on the ballot in all 50 statesâ as an independent. (Schultz will reportedly spend the next three months traveling the country&#8212;perhaps, say, to Iowa&#8212;before making an official announcement.) Unsurprisingly, the news raised the hackles of fellow billionaire <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> who took time out of his busy day of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089883338758914048\">attacking</a> the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089691564283183105\">media</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089876055224184833\">arguing against the separation of church and state</a> to claim that Schultz has neither the brains nor the balls to run for office:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089881244312178688\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089881244312178688\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089881244312178688</a></p></blockquote></div><p>But Trump wasnât the only member of the three-comma club to come out against Schultzâs (kind-of) candidacy. On Monday afternoon, <strong>Mike Bloomberg</strong> issued a statement on his Web site saying that <a href=\"https://www.mikebloomberg.com/news/mike-bloomberg-statement-independent-run/\">the notion of running as an independent is a horrible idea</a>, and one that will almost certainly put Trump back in the White House for a second term. âI have never been a partisan guy,â the former New York City mayor wrote, âand itâs no secret that I looked at an independent bid in the past. In fact, I faced exactly the same decision now facing others who are considering it. The data was very clear and very consistent. Given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there is no way an independent can win. That is truer today than ever before. In 2020, the great likelihood is that an independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the president. Thatâs a risk I refused to run in 2016 and we canât afford to run it now.â</p>\n<p>To some, the idea of Bloomberg warning Schultz off an independent bid is the height of rich, even if heâs clearly 100 percent right. But as the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/#59bf86d61417\">$48 Billion Dollar Man</a> himself points out, heâs been studying up on how to lose elections for <em>years,</em> and after considering independent runs in 2008, 2012, and 2016, he has the data to say definitively it should never be attempted, particularly when it raises the chances of giving an unhinged lunatic another four years in the White House. Thatâs not to say Bloomberg has an issue with putting another, richer billionaire in office through the two-party system:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With an estimated net worth of $3.3 billion, Mr. Schultz, 65, is one of several billionaires who had been mentioned as possible presidential contenders. The former hedge-fund titan <strong>Tom Steyer,</strong> who had been eyeing a run, announced this month he would focus his energies on a private effort to impeach Mr. Trump. And Mr. Bloomberg has also been contemplating a presidential run.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thatâs a prospect that has Wall Street licking its lips, even if financiers know, deep down inside, that the idea of President Bloomberg is little more than an extremely niche fantasy. âIâm a socially liberal, fiscally conservative centrist who would love to vote for a rational Democrat and get Trump out of the White House,â an anonymous C.E.O. of one of the nationâs largest banks <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/28/wall-street-2020-economy-taxes-1118065\">told</a> Politicoâs <strong>Ben White.</strong> âPersonally, Iâd love to see Bloomberg run and get the nomination. Iâve just never thought he could get the nomination the way the primary process works.â</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Schultzâs listening-tour is off to a great start</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/alexis_levinson/status/1090039389495939072\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexis_levinson/status/1090039389495939072\">https://twitter.com/alexis_levinson/status/1090039389495939072</a></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Speaking of Wall Streetâs hopes and fears for 2020</strong></p>\n<p>It should surprise virtually no one to hear that two words <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-warren-eyes-white-house-big-banks-brace-for-browbeating-11548671401\">are keeping the industry up at night</a>: <strong>Elizabeth Warren:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Warrenâs presidential bid will be driven by her populist assault on big banks that helped her rise to prominence during the financial crisis and in her successful 2012 Massachusetts Senate race.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although the economy has recovered and new, stricter regulations remain largely in place, Ms. Warren sees cause for further vigilance, and many on Wall Street dread another round of criticism on an even bigger national stage&#8212;the Democratic presidential primary race.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âShe has this sort of applause line that we are all crooks, which is scary that you may hear that for a year and a half,â said a large U.S. bank executive who asked to remain anonymous for fear of a Warren backlash.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Still, at least some on Wall Street understand that a president who might nominate regulators who actually hold the industry accountable or insist on stricter oversight of the people that brought you <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/elizabeth-warren-eviscerates-equifax-for-profiting-off-screw-up\">the Equifax hack</a>, is <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/28/wall-street-2020-economy-taxes-1118065\">preferable</a> to an unpredictable lunatic who drags the country into self-defeating trade wars and shuts the government down because someone forgot to feed him his Big Macs and his blood sugar plummeted.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Among the most hardcore Democrats on Wall Street, the strong desire is to find a candidate&#8212;any candidate&#8212;who can beat Trump, even if that means getting behind someone like Warren who supports policies that bankers hate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>âEverybody just wants to win,â a senior executive told Politico. âItâs as wide open as Iâve ever seen it. There is no gravitational force that everyone is sort of running towards. Everyone has their candidate. Frankly, if people believed Warren would win, theyâd jump on board. And everyone in the top tier not named Bernie Sanders could probably win.â</p>\n<p><strong>Wall Streetâs #MeToo takeaway: avoid women women like the plague</strong></p>\n<p>âI now think twice about spending one-on-one time with a young female colleague,â a U.S. finance executive <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/world/europe/metoo-backlash-gender-equality-davos-men.html\">confessed</a> to <em>The New York Times</em> on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, requesting anonymity because the issue is âjust too sensitive.â Apparently worried they might accidentally sexually harass someone, âa number of men have [said] that they will avoid going to dinner with a female mentee,â and that theyâre âconcerned about deploying a woman solo on-site with a male,â <strong>Pat Milligan,</strong> who advises multi-national companies on gender and diversity issues, told reporter <strong>Katrin Bennhold.</strong> Men who donât know how to behave around women in a way that couldnât be construed as harassment: the true victims of #MeToo!</p>\n<p><strong>A.O.C. puts big tech on notice</strong></p>\n<p>In a letter co-signed by Representative <strong>Chellie Pingree,</strong> the freshman congresswoman told Facebook, Microsoft, and Google that she was âdeeply disappointedâ to learn that the companies âwere high-level sponsors of a conference this month . . . known as LibertyCon, that included a session denying established science on climate change.â Noting that the corporations have pledged to reduce their carbon footprints and committed to pursuing renewable energy, the lawmakers said that such efforts were undercut by âimplicit support of the session organized at LibertyCon.â Likening todayâs âcoordinated campaign to deny climate change, or to put a positive spin on its effectsâ as ânot unlike that of the tobacco companies which once sought to discredit their productâs link to cancer,â Ocasio-Cortez and Pingree said the tech giants must ensure that such climate-change propaganda âdo not reflect the values of your companies going forward,â whether intentional or otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>What Trumpâs shutdown hath wrought</strong></p>\n<p>A day after president and his chief of staff <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-is-already-threatening-a-second-shutdown\">threatened</a> to shut down the government for a second time come February 15, the Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/28/government-shutdown-cost-1123735\">reported</a> that the 35-day temper tantrum cost the U.S. economy roughly $3 billion in lost economic activity that âwill not be recouped.â Meanwhile, federal contractors, who will not receive back pay for five weeks of lost wages, will have to wait another month until receiving a full paycheck, because their companies will have to wait to be paid by the government. (âIt feels like we are still hostages,â <strong>Janice Morgan,</strong> who also had her insurance cut off during the shutdown, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/it-feels-like-we-are-still-hostages-federal-contractors-who-lost-health-insurance-during-shutdown-remain-in-limbo/2019/01/27/9a1020a2-20c3-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html\">told</a> <em>The Washington Post.</em>) And how âbout <a href=\"https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2019/01/26/joshua-tree-national-park-rally-against-shutdown-impact/2689866002/\">those national parks</a>?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The federal government shutdown may be over, but fans of Joshua Tree National Park are still angry and upset about the furlough that kept park rangers off the job. . . . Park gates remained open during the shutdown as vandals cut down several Joshua trees and damaged rocks. Without park maintenance crews for the first three weeks, volunteers stepped up to clean bathrooms and collect trash. <strong>Curt Sauer,</strong> who retired as Joshua Tree National Park superintendent in 2010, praised the work of volunteers and lamented the damage caused to the park from illegal campfires, camping and vehicle travel. âWhatâs happened to our park in the last 34 days is irreparable for the next 200 to 300 years,â he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Remember Gary Cohn asked C.E.O.s to raise their hands if they were going to spend their tax-cut savings on investments no one did?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/1-5-trillion-tax-cut-had-no-major-impact-business-n963411\">Turns out they werenât kidding</a>!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Trump administrationâs $1.5 trillion tax cut package appeared to have no major impact on businessesâ capital investment or hiring plans, according to a survey released a year after the biggest overhaul of the tax code in more than 30 years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The National Association of Business Economicsâ quarterly business conditions poll, published on Monday, found that while some companies reported accelerating investments because of lower corporate taxes, 84 percent of respondents said they had not changed plans. That compares to 81 percent in the previous survey published in October.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>âA large majority of respondents, 84 percent, indicate that one year after its passage, the corporate tax reform has not caused their firms to change hiring or investment plans,â said NABE president <strong>Kevin Swift.</strong> As a reminder, the White Houseâs big argument for the tax bill was that it would lead to an investment boom, with companies showering workers with their billions in tax savings.</p>\n<p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>Treasury Set to Borrow $1 Trillion for a Second Year to Finance the Deficit (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-28/another-year-another-1-trillion-in-new-debt-for-u-s-to-raise\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>Bridgewater, RenTech Make $13 Billion in a Grim Year for Hedge Funds (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-28/bridgewater-rentech-make-13-billion-in-a-grim-hedge-fund-year\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>âAnother frustration with manufacturing in Texas: American workers wonât work around the clock.

catastrophe.","body":"<p>When <strong>Sir Norman Foster</strong> was commissioned to design Bloombergâs European headquarters, he was charged with balancing two ambitious objectives: aesthetic brilliance and environmental innovation. True to form, the multi-award-winning architect behind the Gherkin, the Millennium Bridge and the vast glass dome that frosts Germanyâs Reichstag surpassed expectations. Rising above a restored Roman temple on a 3.2-acre site between Bank and St Paulâs, the 10-storey building was awarded the 2018 Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Prize. Fitted with bronze lung-like blades that work as natural ventilators, smart airflow controls, and a water conservation system that saves 25 million litres of water each year (enough to fill 10 Olympic swimming pools), it has also been named the most sustainable office in the world. âIt has not just raised the bar for office design and city planning, but smashed the ceiling,â said RIBA president, <strong>Ben Derbyshire</strong>, when describing the âonce-in-a-generation projectâ.</p>\n<p>With its ceiling-smashing credentials, Bloomberg HQ was the natural space to host the inaugural Bloomberg <em>Vanity Fair</em> Climate Exchange, which took place on December 11 and 12, 2018, closing a febrile year of environmental advance, tumult, hope and despair. In October, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a landmark report warning that we have just 12 years to avert catastrophe by working to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5Â°C. A mere half-degree rise beyond this level, they wrote, will significantly aggravate the risk of droughts, floods, extreme temperatures and acute poverty for large swathes of the worldâs population. The report was commissioned at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech in 2016. Since then, the chasm between politics and environmental science has deepened. Leading the charge, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, and cast climate change research as a partisan, anti-business ill. Similarly, Brazilâs new president <strong>Jair Bolsonaro</strong> has dismissed environmental protections, and removed Brazil from the list of potential hosts for the UNâs upcoming climate conference.</p>\n<p>As some lawmakers negate their responsibility to safeguard the environment, and others remain too divided to conceive and implement pioneering legislation, the Exchange was an opportunity to gather a network of leading figures, outline the shared, systemic problems threatening every industry, and also offer a panoramic insight into the work of the groups and individuals who are enacting change.</p>\n<p>The opening of the Exchange was marked with a glittering Gala dinner. Arriving outside Bloomberg HQ (thought to be the largest stone building built in the City of London since St Paulâs Cathedral), guests were confronted with Danish-Icelandic artist <strong>Olafur Eliasson</strong>âs installation, Ice Watch. Six enormous hulks of blue-hued, slowly melting hunks of glacial ice extracted from the waters surrounding Greenland, the sculptures were intended to serve as a visual reminder of the impact of climate change. Moving inside, and into a line of futuristic transparent lifts, guests arrived at the officeâs large atrium area, which is dominated by a bronze ramp called the Vortex that spans six desk-filled floors, winding towards a glazed rooflight.</p>\n<p>As the crowd swelled to include <strong>Tracey Emin</strong>, <strong>Rod Stewart</strong>, <strong>Tom Daley</strong>, <strong>Gizzi Erskine</strong>, <strong>Yana Peel</strong> and <strong>Paloma Faith</strong>, the model, activist and actress <strong>Lily Cole</strong>&#8212;wearing a <strong>Christopher Raeburn</strong> two-piece fashioned from 1950s Royal Air Force silk maps&#8212;took a break from the drinks reception and made her way to <em>Vanity Fair</em>âs signature portrait studio, where photographer <strong>Matt Holyoak</strong> was busily shooting guests spanning politics, business, fashion and the arts. She was soon followed by a stream of stars, including <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> actress <strong>Victoria Loke</strong>, actor <strong>Rob Lowe</strong>, and <strong>Stella McCartney</strong>, whose date for the evening was model <strong>Arizona Muse</strong>. Sitting down for dinner at two long, flower-laden tables, guests were soon treated to  a surprise appearance from <strong>Ellie Goulding</strong> who, after belting out a roster of hits, sat for her own portrait.</p>\n<p>The following day was introduced by <em>Vanity Fair</em> editor <strong>Radhika Jones</strong> and <strong>Michael R. Bloomberg</strong>, who was appointed UN Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change in 2014, and has consistently advocated for the US to move towards clean energy. Primarily operating through Bloomberg Philanthropies, he has invested millions of dollars into sustainability, often working at a municipal level to avoid becoming embroiled in Americaâs choked federal system.</p>\n<p>The first act focused on business and culture, and was opened by London Mayor <strong>Sadiq Khan</strong>, whose theme was the relation between cities and climate-friendly business. âIn the absence of national leadership, itâs cities, business and civil society that can and must step into the breach to ensure we honour the Paris Agreement,â said Khan, echoing comments that Bloomberg himself made when speaking to <em>Vanity Fair</em> in December: âCities are where people are, and theyâre where the carbon emissions are. So if you get cities to do the right thing, you can make an awful lot of progress.â</p>\n<p>Next up was a conversation between <strong>Christiane Amanpour</strong>, CNNâs chief international anchor, and designer Stella McCartney, exploring the ways that the fashion industry can help curb climate change. A champion of sustainable practices long before they became trendy (the fashion industry contributes 10 per cent of global greenhouse emissions), McCartney even sourced animal-friendly shoes in her Central Saint Martins graduate fashion show (these were overshadowed by the fact they were modelled by her friends <strong>Kate Moss</strong> and <strong>Naomi Campbell</strong>). Later, setting up her eponymous label after a successful stint at ChloÃ©, McCartney set herself ambitious sustainability targets and advocated animal welfare, ultimately stirring a movement that has since swelled and inspired other luxury brands to follow suit: Gucci, Armani, Versace and Burberry have all shunned fur. âBecause the fashion industry has a significant impact on the environment, there is an enormous opportunity for consequential change,â McCartney explained to Amanpour, stressing the business case for sustainable fashion, and expanding on the recent UN fashion industry charter for climate action. âUltimately, itâs the smart decision for the planet and for our industry.â</p>\n<p>After performances from a selection of spoken-word poets, the curtain lifted on the second act: oceans. Moderated by <strong>Ian Urbina</strong>, the investigative reporter for <em>The New York Times</em>, who has reported on Pulitzer Prize-winning stories and whose articles are regularly adapted into films, the panel talk focused on the positive impact of conserving coral and protecting oceans from overfishing. <strong>Baroness Patricia Scotland QC</strong>, secretary-general of the Commonwealth, dialled in via video link to join <strong>Tony Long</strong>, CEO of Global Fishing Watch, and chairman <strong>Anisa Kamadoli Costa</strong>, who spearheads Tiffany &amp; Coâs sustainability efforts. These began in earnest when the iconic jewellery maker made the unprecedented move of removing coral&#8212;often called the nursery of the oceans&#8212;from their products. âWe have a real responsibility&#8212;and opportunity&#8212;to set the trend for what sustainable luxury means in the jewellery industry,â said Kamadoli Costa, who holds the dual title of president of the Tiffany &amp; Co Foundation and chief sustainability officer, in an interview with VF before the Exchange. âSustainable luxury is quality and craftsmanship, but also the environmental and social standards that we choose to uphold. We have the power and privilege of using the Tiffany brand to make an impact. I donât think now is the time to stay silent.â</p>\n<p>The third act was energy, and saw <strong>Mayor William Peduto</strong> of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania&#8212;the âParis of Appalachiaâ&#8212;discuss the challenges of transitioning off coal and its impacts on public health, and the urgency of local leadership in the fight against climate change. âCities and citizens have an important role to play in the fight against climate change,â said Mayor Peduto, who expressed his frustration at Trumpâs decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in the documentary Paris to Pittsburgh, which looks at the cityâs efforts to reduce carbon emissions. âI was proud to represent my city at the COP [United Nations Conference of Parties] in Poland and again here in London as we continue to find ways to unite the various actors in this critical time.â</p>\n<p>Coinciding with the third anniversary of the signing of the Paris Agreement, the Exchange aimed to galvanise progress ahead of the upcoming UN Climate Change Summit, which promises to be a fraught, urgent affair. But the focus wasnât just negative. The Exchange also celebrated the progress being made across multiple spheres, spotlighting the creativity and entrepreneurial acuity being channelled towards safeguarding the natural world, restructuring the cities we live in and empowering individuals to enact change. âClimate change has proven to be both a short- and long-term threat with this year demonstrating some of the worst impacts on citizens worldwide,â said Michael R. Bloomberg. âFollowing on from world leaders gathering in Poland to discuss the issue, the Climate Exchange has highlighted the human impact and solutions.â</p>","rubric":"From the

Jacksonâs camp.","body":"<p>The estate of Michael Jackson has taken another step to formally push back against the upcoming documentary <em>Leaving Neverland,</em> which focuses on pedophilia allegations made against the late entertainer. Estate attorney <strong>Howard Weitzman</strong> sent a letter to Channel 4, the U.K. network that is set to air the film in early March. In the letter, Weitzman claims the <em>Leaving Neverland</em> filmmakers never attempted to reach out to the Jackson estate, nor did they reach out to family, friends, and other defenders of Jackson, falling short of the networkâs <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/producers-handbook/c4-guidelines/factual-programme-guidelines\">ethical guidelines</a>.</p>\n<p>âThose concerned should be given an appropriate and timely opportunity to respond,â the letter reads, per the <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/20a6870958754ec5978935d4bc06451e\">Associated Press</a>. âI think we can all agree that the false allegations being made in your âdocumentaryâ are âsignificant allegationsâ . . . it is hard to imagine more significant accusations that can possibly be made against anyone.â</p>\n<p>The estate also sent a letter to HBO, which will air the film in the U.S., calling the Jackson accusers âdisgracefulâ and saying their backgrounds should be examined, per the A.P.</p>\n<p>Channel 4 has responded by noting that Jacksonâs past denials of the allegations are included in the film, which is enough to meet the networkâs standards. âOn this occasion the person against whom the significant allegations are being made is deceased. It is therefore appropriate that his denials during life are included in the program,â the station said, according to the A.P. Jackson died in 2009.</p>\n<p><em>Leaving Neverland</em> director <strong>Dan Reed</strong> has also responded to the estate, noting that the focus of the film is on the two accusers, <strong>Wade Robson</strong> and <strong>James Safechuck,</strong> both of whom have said that Jackson molested them when they were children. In the past, both accusers explicitly told authorities that the singer did not molest them; Robson also testified at Jacksonâs 2005 trial. Jackson denied the allegations and was not convicted. âAnyone who sees the film will know it is solely about hearing the stories of two specific individuals and their families in their own words, and that is a focus we are very proud of,â Reed said.</p>\n<p><em>Leaving Neverland</em> made its debut in January at the Sundance Film Festival, where <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/michael-jackson-documentary-leaving-neverland-stuns-at-sundance\">it stunned critics</a> and sparked backlash from Jacksonâs most ardent fans. Robson and Safechuck attended the debut screening, sitting down for a Q&amp;A afterward. âWe are just trying to tell the story, to shine light on it,â Safechuck said. âThe same way&#8212;knowing Wade went through this&#8212;we can give other people the connection and comfort that weâve received.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The <a

The documentary provides detailed accounts of the allegations first brought forth by Robson and Safechuck <a href=\"https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2014/08/michael-jackson-wade-robson-sexual-assault-anal/\">in 2013</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/exclusive-michael-jackson-hit-with-new-sex-abuse-claim\">2014</a>, in lawsuits against the Jackson estate that were eventually dismissed due to statutes of limitations. In addition to providing detailed accusations of both sexual activity and repeated efforts by Jackson to quiet the boys, <em>Leaving Neverland</em> showcases the effect the late pop star had on Robson and Safechuckâs families, with detailed interviews with the menâs mothers, wives, and siblings.</p>\n<p>In 1993, Jackson was accused of molesting 13-year-old Jordan Chandler. The case ended after Jackson reached a civil settlement with the Chandler family for <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/06/16/michael.jackson/\">$20 million</a>. In 2003, an arrest warrant was issued and Jackson was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/12/18/jackson.case/\">charged</a> with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent for the purpose of committing a felony. He was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/13/national/michael-jackson-is-acquitted-on-all-counts-in-molestation-case.html\">acquitted in 2005</a> of all charges. In a 2003 British documentary, Jackson admitted to sharing his bed with young boys but called it a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/14/us/michael-jackson-cleared-after-14week-child-molesting-trial.html\">loving act</a> that had nothing to do with sex.</p>\n<p>Jackson denied all charges. He was aided in his defense by both Robson and Safechuck. Robson testified on Jacksonâs behalf during both trials while Safechuck declined to provide testimony in the second trial, a move that Safechuck says angered Jackson and ended his relationship with the pop star. The about-face by the two victims is investigated thoroughly in the film and Robson elaborated on it further. âThere was no repressed memory. I never forgot any of it,â he said. âA lot of what was going on when I was 11, was the direct fear that Michael put into me that if anybody was to find out about this, both of us would go to jail for the rest of our lives. I absolutely believed that. I was terrified of that. And I was terrified for Michael. I loved Michael and I was trying to save him. So many things were going on at the same time: fear, shame, confusion, and love. I knew I was telling a lie but I knew I had to. I felt like I had no choice.â</p>\n<p>Since the two-part, four-hour documentary was first announced itâs been the subject of controversy. The extended Jackson family and their die-hard supporters have waged attacks on the film, its subjects, and journalists covering the movie. <strong>Howard Weitzman,</strong> an attorney for Jacksonâs estate, called the film disgraceful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/michael-jackson-estate-leaving-neverland-letter-channel-4\">in a 10-page letter to HBO</a>, adding âWe know that this will go down as the most shameful episode in HBOâs history. We know that Michaelâs devoted fans, and all good people in the world, will not swiftly forgive HBO for its conduct.â</p>\n<p>The filmmakers and subjects of the film expected such uproar. The embrace they received from their Sundance audience proved more surprising. âGetting public support is not something we are used to,â said Safechuck, during an interview in Park City, Utah, the day after the filmâs premiere last month. âWe are not used to people believing us. My mother believes me&#8212;Iâm used to that&#8212;but Iâm not used to other people believing me.â</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/56a2690cff2afb2567000010.js?autoplay=0\"></div></div><p>Robson and Safechuck first met Reed in 2016 when the director approached them with interest in telling their story. Reed, a British documentarian <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/arts/television/19hbo.html\">best known for his work covering the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack</a>, had no real interest in Jackson or show business. He wasnât even very familiar with any of his songs. Rather, Reed was compelled by the opportunity to be inside the story, to take a closer look at the controversies that dogged Jackson since his first accuser, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1994/01/orth199401\">Chandler, came forward in 1993</a>.</p>\n<p>âI would not have done this story if it hadnât been for these guys,â said Reed, sitting at a conference table with Robson and Safechuck. âThis is a chance to reveal something true and extraordinary about a story we think we all know. . . . Itâs very rare that you get that incredible turning of the tables, the inside of a huge story, one thatâs never been resolved yet is one that everyone knows about.â</p>\n<p>Reed spent two days interviewing Safechuck and three speaking with Robson. He also said he needed to take a step back and talk to the family members to understand how their mothers, specifically, could have let their young sons sleep in Jacksonâs bed, spend weekends at his Neverland Ranch, and put so much trust into a man with such strange proclivities. Both men confirmed that they werenât paid for their time or their stories. Rather, they say they were compelled to participate in order to get the truth out. And they did so before the #MeToo movement gave people with allegations of sexual abuse an opportunity for a fairer hearing. Below are edited excerpts from our interview.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Vanity Fair:</em> Is it possible for you two to describe what it was like watching this film with an audience full of strangers?</strong></p>\n<p><em>James Safechuck:</em> I think it will take a few more watches because the first [time] is kind of a shock. Youâre watching a movie with you in it. That in itself is hard to . . . get. It was difficult for me to read the audience. I didnât know if they were connecting to certain parts or not. It might have been obvious to other people, but for me, it was just a lot of nerves and disassociation.</p>\n<p><strong>Havenât you both mastered the art of disassociation?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Safechuck:</em> Yeah, right. I said to Wade yesterday that I donât want to switch off. The survival mechanism of switching off is something we are used to doing. And itâs easy to default to that. And I do not want to do that. I want to go there and stay in the moment and try and feel it.</p>\n<p><em>Wade Robson:</em> In other places, whether its been in the legal proceedings or even talking to friends about this subject matter, it tends to be narrowly focused on what happened between Michael and me. And what the film goes into is the entire effect on our whole families. We had no part in the interviews with our families and they revealed so many feelings that I never knew about me, about our family. Hearing their perspectives keeps re-clarifying the breadth of what this has done to our family. The weight of that keeps hitting at a harder and harder level.</p>\n<p><strong>Dan, you said that you had other interviews and you had a wider scope but you pared the film down to just the families. Now thatâs being used against you by the estate and his fans that you are only telling one side of the story. What do you say to that?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Dan Reed:</em> What is the other side of the story? That Michael Jackson was a great entertainer and a great guy? That may be true but he also raped children.</p>\n<p>It wasnât that I didnât want to represent the other side, the other side being Jackson and his lawyers and the people who donât believe he was a serial child molester. Jackson and his lawyers and the people who attack these guys are represented in the film. We have Jacksonâs dad saying this is awful and terrible and they are liars&#8212;Iâm talking about the other children who brought complaints of their own. And his lawyers say these are a pack of lies.</p>\n<p>But I found Wade and Jamesâs accounts so persuasive and internally consistent and credible that I thought it wasnât worth breaking the storytelling perspective completely to introduce extraneous people who didnât have the kind of intimate access to Jackson, who werenât part of that world that he created around the kids and the abuse. I think there is a divide between people whoâve seen the film and totally get it&#8212;I donât think there was a single person in the cinema yesterday who didnât get what we were doing&#8212;and the people who havenât seen it and are saying but, but.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1994/01/orth19940\">Plus: Read Maureen Orthâs Groundbreaking 1994 Investigation</a></h4>\n<p>We also did fact-checks and we looked for whatever corroboration we could find. The central facts they reveal are the facts of the abuse. And we had the conversations that they had to describe the sex in some detail. We couldnât skirt around that. It would leave a space for the naysayers, for the people whose interest is in discrediting James and Wade [to suggest] it was just affection, just cuddles, it was harmless. No, it was grown-up sexual activity except it was with little children.</p>\n<p><strong>The allegations of abuse are terribly upsetting, made even more so by the fact that both of your accounts were so similar.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Robson:</em> Thatâs been one of the craziest experiences for me. James and I havenât been able to be together or talk to each other, and while I had an expectation, at least with the sexual details, that they would probably be relatively similar, in seeing the film, [I was surprised] to the degree that they were. Beyond the sexual abuse and activity, [I was also surprised] by our symptoms, the details of our lives, us becoming fathers. Itâs been mind-blowing to learn each otherâs stories.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the extent of communication you two had before meeting here in Sundance?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Safechuck:</em> We were in one meeting together with our lawyers, supervised.</p>\n<p><em>Robson:</em> One meeting years and years ago.</p>\n<p><strong>Didnât you want to just pick up the phone and talk to each other?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Safechuck:</em> What brought me into the case was wanting to talk to Wade. And then as soon as I get there, they say, great but you canât talk to him. That was really tough.</p>\n<p><em>Robson:</em> Itâs been this feeling through this time of not being able to communicate but having some sort of knowingness that even though technically we donât, we know each other deeper than we know most other people in our lives because of what weâve been through. I just wanted to be able to connect about that and validate each otherâs experiences, mostly the experiences post abuse: the effects, the struggles, to share that with some who, instinctually, is going to understand.</p>\n<p><em>Safechuck:</em> I would just hold on to knowing that Wade is out there. There was comfort in knowing that I wasnât alone. It also made decisions about doing this movie difficult. We couldnât [decide together] âshould we do it.â We had to make these decisions independently. What do we want? We want the truth. We want to be heard. Is this the right thing to do? Those were hard decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Wade, one of the accusations against you is that you filed your lawsuit because you were broke after they fired you from the Jackson Cirque du Soleil show?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Robson:</em> Itâs just completely inaccurate. I was hired three times for that show because it kept taking different iterations. And the third time was just preceding my second nervous breakdown. I was in between nervous breakdowns. So the third time, as I was crumbling and falling apart, I removed myself from the project. The accusation is completely false.</p>\n<p><strong>Dan, did you reach out to Macaulay Culkin for this piece?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Reed:</em> No, we did not. Macaulay has gone on the record many, many times, including recently to say that his relationship with Jackson was innocent.</p>\n<p><strong>Wade, so much of your career as a dancer and choreographer, is tied to Michael. Do you think you could have had the career you had without him?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Robson:</em> The exact career? No. Michael was the physical access point with which I was first introduced to dance. A good deal about my fear in talking about this, in telling the truth, was that my whole life, including my career, would fall apart. Once I began talking about it, everything got painted black. I quit everything: dance, music, film, everything Iâd ever known because it was all tied to Michael. If I started dancing, thereâs Michael, in my body. That was the feeling. So I stopped all of it for five years. I didnât dance for five years. And I never thought I would ever again in my life.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, just over a year and a half ago, Iâd done enough internal work and done enough pulling these things apart&#8212;separating him from art in my life and dance in my life&#8212;somehow dance flew back into my heart and I started trying to approach it differently, being more playful and not so outcome-oriented, which is so much of the seriousness that he put into me. Everything was about being the best, ruling the world, changing the world, all these insanely heavy expectations for something that is artistic and is supposed to be experimental and joyful.</p>\n<p><strong>Whatâs it like for both of you when you hear a Michael Jackson song today?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Safechuck:</em> Itâs still really hard for me. And I donât think a day goes by where I donât hear a song. You go out to have a drink with your friend, youâre trying to relax and let everything go, and heâll come on. Every time. Itâs hard. It gets easier, but itâs still hard.</p>\n<p><em>Robson:</em> In the beginning, I was extremely sensitive to it. I would be at a lunch or a dinner with my wife, my child, and something would come on, and it would take over my whole body and I would have to leave the place. Itâs rarely that physically intense now, unless Iâm in a place for children, a playground, an inside gym. In those types of situations, a Michael song will come on and itâs a place that is supposed to protect children. Thatâs really difficult.</p>\n<p><em>Safechuck:</em> You know what is a hard one for me: my kids love <strong>Weird Al [Yankovic]</strong> and they love [the âBadâ parody] âFat.â They love it! And Iâm like, God, do I take this away from my kids?</p>\n<p><em>Robson:</em> My son came home from school one day, a few years ago, and he said, check out this thing my friend taught me: and he did some version of the Moonwalk. It was extremely triggering to me but then, as a parent, Iâm trying to stop myself, because I donât want to put my issues on him. But Michael is everywhere. Itâs challenging.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; What 2019âs Oscar nominees <a

Country.â Proceed with care.</h4>\n<p>Blinked and you might have missed <strong>Michael Rookerâs</strong> debut in <em>True Detective</em> last week as the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/true-detective-michael-rooker-hoyt-season-3\">camera briefly lingered</a> on a photo of his mysterious character, an Arkansas tycoon named Edward Hoyt. Though audiences still have yet to see Hoyt in action on the series, we did get a lengthier taste of what Rooker might have in store for us <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/true-detective-hoyt-pink-room-season-3-episode-6-kidnap-julie\">as the Big Bad</a> via a menacing phone call that closed out this weekâs episode. In the latest installment of <em>Vanity Fair</em>â* <em>Still Watching: True Detective</em> podcast, director <strong>Daniel Sackheim</strong> both teases what we might expect from Rooker in the finale and why it took him some convincing to cast his good friend in the role.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://player.megaphone.fm/PPY2550052150?light=true\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://player.megaphone.fm/PPY2550052150?light=true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>Sackheim confirms what others have <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/true-detective-hoyt-daughter-gerald-kindt-bill-clinton-lucy-purcell-harris-james\">noted elsewhere</a> this season, namely that the character of Edward Hoyt and Hoyt Foods are âinspired byâÂ a real-life power player in 1980s and 90s Arkansas: Don Tyson of Tyson Foods fame. In 1966, Tyson was named president of the company his father founded, and under his leadership the company grew from a multi-million-dollar company to a multi-billion-dollar global power. Tyson plunged his fingers deep in the political landscape of Arkansas and, later, when his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/03/22/in-arkansas-the-game-is-chicken/6244e0fa-5416-4a6a-bae8-a229b854ed98/?utm_term=.a7f421ca90fa\">early investment</a> in local politician <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> paid off, had strong connections to the White House as well. Sackheim admits that Rooker&#8212;who often plays intimidating shit-kicker types&#8212;didnât strike him as the right match for a âcaptain of industry.â Thatâs when series creator <strong>Nic Pizzolatto</strong> introduced Sackheim to footage of the real Don Tyson.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pUY9eM4qEgU\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pUY9eM4qEgU\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>âHe was a guy who came to work every day in a khaki jumpsuit and a trucker hat,âÂ Sackheim says, âwho was as much on the chicken line as he was in the corporate office.â Tyson got his start in the family business as a chicken catcher and truck driver, prompting Sackheim to call him a âself-made man.â As self-made as you can be with your name on the logo of the company, anyway.</p>\n<p>Though Hoytâs not-so-veiled phone threats to <strong>Mahershala Aliâs</strong> Wayne at the end of Episode 7 were enough to chill Detective Hays to the bone, Sackheim further explains that Don Tyson&#8212;and by extension Edward Hoyt&#8212;is not a particularly âsophisticated or eloquentâ figure. He expects Rookerâs performance is, perhaps, not what audiences might have pictured Hoyt to be. No wonder <em>True Detective</em> kept this particular casting <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/true-detective-michael-rooker-hoyt-season-3\">under wraps</a>. Sackheim calls Rookerâs turn in Episode 8&#8212;where heâs due to square off opposite Ali&#8212;âmagnificent.â</p>\n<p>The Don Tyson connection isnât the only real-world inspiration to enhance the authentic Arkansas flavor of <em>True Detective</em> Season 3. Pizzolattoâs childhood in Louisiana may have given Season 1 its potent bayou vibe, but the show-runner went to graduate school at the University of Arkansas, and his fascination with a state that, Sackheim says, was very ânear and dearâ to his heart resulted in this seasonâs sideways examination of the power structures in place there. Though Sackheim says he ânever askedâ if the character of Attorney General Gerald Kindt was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/true-detective-hoyt-daughter-gerald-kindt-bill-clinton-lucy-purcell-harris-james\">inspired by real-life Arkansas Attorney General Bill Clinton</a>, the many controversies swirling around the Clinton dynasty have seeped into the Season 3 narrative.</p>\n<p>Take, for instance, Elisaâs (<strong>Sarah Gadon</strong>) Episode 7 insistence that pedophilia and sex trafficking are somehow connected to the disappearance of Julie Purcell and the murder of her brother, Will.  This theory of Elisaâs&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/true-detective-season-3-theories-debunked-season-1-connection\">which seems largely dismissed by the episode itself</a>&#8212;is overtly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_child_prostitution_ring_allegations\">connected to the debunked Franklin conspiracy</a>, but also, less directly, to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory\">debunked Pizzagate conspiracy</a> that dogged the 2016 <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> election campaign.</p>\n<p>Similarly, with the Clintons on the brain, itâs hard to avoid thinking of the Whitewater scandal of the 1990s that linked the White House to both a real-estate controversy back in Arkansas and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/5/25/11761128/vince-foster\">the death of Clintonâs deputy White House counsel Vince Foster</a>. Despite many, many, many investigations, thereâs no evidence that Fosterâs death was anything other than a suicide. But that hasnât stopped many notable figures over the years&#8212;including <strong><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-escalates-attack-on-bill-clinton/2016/05/23/ed109acc-2100-11e6-8690-f14ca9de2972_story.html?utm_term=.61b12866acbb\">Donald Trump</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/why-was-kavanaugh-obsessed-with-vince-foster.html\">Brett Kavanaugh</a></strong>&#8212;from implying some sort of staged conspiracy and cover-up. As we learned this week on <em>True Detective,</em> staging suicides seems to be one of Hoytâs favorite ways of eliminating troublesome figures like Tom and Lucy Purcell.</p>\n<p>Even more pertinently&#8212;though still firmly in the realm of conspiracy&#8212;is the case of the Boys on the Tracks. In this weekâs episode, Elisa points out to Wayne how many people around the Purcell case went missing or turned up dead over the years. Tom, Lucy, Harris James, Cousin Dan, Brett Woodard, etc.</p>\n<p>In 1987, 17-year-old Kevin Ives and and his best friend, 16-year-old Don Henry, were found dead on train tracks in Alexander, Arkansas. Initial autopsies alleged that the boys had fallen asleep on the tracks after reportedly smoking 20 joints of marijuana. But <a href=\"http://swordandscale.com/the-boys-on-the-tracks/\">other evidence</a>&#8212;including, allegedly, stab wounds&#8212;indicated that the boys, much like Will Purcell, were likely killed elsewhere and dragged to a second location, where their bodies were found. The case remains unsolved, and is considered one of the most <a href=\"https://thoughtcatalog.com/julia-metraux/2019/01/heres-the-most-harrowing-unsolved-murder-from-every-state/\">unsettling</a> cold cases in the nation. <strong><a href=\"http://maraleveritt.com/books-by-mara-leveritt/\">Mara Leveritt</a></strong>&#8212;an Arkansas reporter who famously wrote about the West Memphis Three and is something of an inspiration for the Amelia character&#8212;wrote <em>The Boys on the Tracks: Death, Denial, and a Motherâs Crusade to Bring Her Sonâs Killers to Justice</em> about Linda Ivesâs quest for the truth about her sonâs death.</p>\n<p>Ives and a number of others who have looked into the case believe that the government was somehow involved; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/4g1qn2/who_put_the_bodies_of_don_henry_16_and_kevin_ives/\">the most popular theory among those who favor conspiracies</a> paints Kevin and Donâs deaths as a massive cover-up after the boys stumbled upon a drug-related government operation. Clinton was the governor of Arkansas at the time&#8212;so, as you can imagine, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clinton_Chronicles\">his name has been tied up with this case in certain circles for years</a>. Much like the Purcell case, <a href=\"https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2017/08/the-mysterious-case-of-the-arkansas-train-deaths/\">back in the 1980s</a>, a number of people who either knew about the Boys on the Tracks or were slated to testify died mysteriously. While itâs true a number of people of interest died for a number of different causes, no direct link to the case itself has ever been proven.</p>\n<p>Though he may not be trying to make any kind of pointed commentary about the Clintons via the lurid crimes of <em>True Detective</em> Season 3, Pizzolatto loves broad conspiracies <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/did-a-horrifying-real-satanic-sex-abuse-case-inspire-tr-1533541931\">based on real-life horrors</a> and shadowy government cover-ups. When it comes to writing about Arkansas in the 80s and 90s, thereâs no way to do just that without invoking some of the stateâs most powerful and famous families: the Tysons and the Clintons.</p>","rubric":"Watching the Detectives","socialTitle":"Why True Detective Picked Michael Rooker to Play Its Villainous Tycoon","socialDescription":"The real-life inspiration behind the seasonâs Big Bad.","seoTitle":"True Detective: Why Michael Rooker Plays Hoyt","seoDescription":"The real-life inspiration behind the seasonâs Big Bad.","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","interactiveOverride":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":[],"revisionAuthor":"Rachel Freeman","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5c6634493fc1123162a5c862","revision":36,"createdAt":"February 14, 2019 10:38 pm","modifiedAt":"February 19, 2019 10:37 am","revisionCreatedAt":"February 19, 2019 10:37 am","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Hollywood","slug":"hollywood","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fae03af0739cf33e0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Television","slug":"television","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120ae03af0739cf33e2","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Joanna Robinson is a Hollywood writer covering TV and film for VanityFair.com.

height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_Ze8LjzV7Q\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"> </iframe></div></div><p>HBOâs highly anticipated documentary <em>Leaving Neverland</em> is just two weeks away from its debut&#8212;and judging by the two-part filmâs newly released trailer, itâs going to be exactly as difficult to watch as one might assume.</p>\n<p><em>Leaving Neverland</em> documents the experiences of <strong>James Safechuck</strong> and <strong>Wade Robson,</strong> both of whom were befriended by Michael Jackson when they were children&#8212;and allegedly sexually abused by him for years. According to HBOâs description, the film includes interviews with both Safechuck and Robson&#8212;now 40 and 36 years old, respectively&#8212;along with their families, which combine to form âa portrait of sustained abuse, exploring the complicated feelings that led both men to confront their experiences after both had a young son of his own.â</p>\n<p>Michael Jacksonâs estate&#8212;which still plans to bring the M.J.-themed jukebox musical <em>Donât Stop âTil You Get Enough</em> to Broadway <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/michael-jackson-broadway-musical-allegations-leaving-neverland\">in 2020</a>&#8212;decried  <em>Leaving Neverland</em> in January. âThis is yet another lurid production in an outrageous and pathetic attempt to exploit and cash in on Michael Jackson,â the family wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/michael-jackson-documentary-leaving-neverland-surviving-r-kelly\">statement</a>. The estate used even harsher words to describe the film in a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/michael-jackson-estate-calls-neverland-doc-tabloid-character-assassination\">later statement</a>, calling the project âthe kind of tabloid character assassination Michael Jackson endured in life, and now in death.â Jackson, who died in 2009, did face accusations of abuse when he was alive as well: the musician was indicted on charges including four counts of molesting a minor in 2004. In 2005, a jury found him not guilty on all charges. Jackson was also accused of sexually abusing a 13-year-old boy in 1993, and settled out of court with the boyâs family for more than $20 million in 1994.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/02/leaving-neverland-trailer-michael-jackson-hbo-documentary-dan-reed-1202560263/\">Deadline</a>, HBO said last week that it had no plans to meet with representatives from Jackson estate, which has continued to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/michael-jackson-estate-leaving-neverland-letter-channel-4\">push back</a> against the film with claims the filmmakers never approached Jacksonâs estate, or any of his family, friends, or defenders while assembling their documentary. âThose concerned should be given an appropriate and timely opportunity to respond,â a letter from the estateâs representative reportedly read. âI think we can all agree that the false allegations being made in your âdocumentaryâ are âsignificant allegationsâ . . . it is hard to imagine more significant accusations that can possibly be made against anyone.â</p>\n<p>Responding to the controversy surrounding the doc at the T.C.A.s, Deadline reports that HBOâs <strong>Casey Bloys</strong> said, âThe one thing I would say about this documentary is I would ask everybody to watch it and make their judgments after seeing it.â</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/the-worst-kept-secret-of-trumps-presidency?inline\">worst-kept

musical to Broadway in the summer of 2020.","body":"<p>Three weeks after a haunting Michael Jackson documentary <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/michael-jackson-documentary-leaving-neverland-stuns-at-sundance\">debuted at</a> the Sundance Film Festival, raising new <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/michael-jackson-documentary-leaving-neverland\">sexual abuse claims</a> against the late singer, Jacksonâs estate has made it known that it will continue with plans to launch a stage musical based on the life and works of the late musician, titled <em>Donât Stop âTil You Get Enough.</em></p>\n<p>The news was folded into a report from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/theater/michael-jackson-chicago-musical-cancelled.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> stating that the Jackson estate and producing partner Columbia Live Stage would be canceling a planned Chicago premiere for the show. Though that run is being halted, the estate still hopes to unveil the musical&#8212;with a book by two-time Pulitzer Prize winner <strong>Lynn Nottage</strong> and directing and choreography by Tony winner <strong>Christopher Wheeldon</strong>&#8212;on Broadway in the summer of 2020. The official reason given for the Chicago cancellation was not the press around the documentary, <em>Leaving Neverland</em>&#8212;which will air on HBO in early March&#8212;but âscheduling difficultiesâ brought on because of a labor dispute.</p>\n<p>According to the <em>Times,</em> âthe musical will focus on the period of time leading up to Jacksonâs âDangerousâ world tour which began in 1992.â</p>\n<p>Jacksonâs family has remained adamant that the <em>Leaving Neverland</em> documentary&#8212;which details Jacksonâs <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/michael-jackson-documentary-leaving-neverland-stuns-at-sundance\">alleged sexual abuse</a> of <strong>Wade Robson</strong> and <strong>James Safechuck</strong> when they were children&#8212;is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/michael-jackson-estate-leaving-neverland-letter-channel-4\">âdisgracefulâ</a> and âtabloid character assassination.â</p>\n<p>In a televised interview late last month, Jacksonâs surviving brother <strong>Jermaine</strong> said that he was â1,000 percent sureâ Michael was not guilty of what Robson and Safechuck have accused him of, âbecause [he] was tried by a jury and . . . he was acquitted on all of this.â (Jackson was indicted on charges including four counts of molesting a minor in 2004; in 2005, a jury found him not guilty on all charges. Jackson was also accused of sexually abusing a 13-year-old boy in 1993, and settled out of court with the boyâs family for more than $20 million in 1994.) Jermaine <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/michael-jackson-documentary-leaving-neverland\">added</a>, âOur family is tired. Let this man rest. He did a lot for the world. Let him rest. Iâll just say this: there is no truth to this documentary.â</p>\n<p>Jacksonâs estate recently sent <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/02/11/michael-jackson-estate-leaving-neverland-violates-channel-standards/\">a letter</a> to the U.K.âs Channel 4 in hopes that it would pull <em>Leaving Neverland</em> from its schedule. The estate argued that the documentary âviolates the networkâs programming guidelines,â in that the filmmakers did not seek a response from Jacksonâs estate, family, or friends about the allegations made within the film. The network, however, has already dismissed the letter&#8212;claiming that the allegations against Jackson <em>are</em> rebutted in the film by denials Jackson made himself before dying in 2009.</p>\n<p>âOn this occasion the person against whom the significant allegations are being made is deceased,â the network responded. âIt is therefore appropriate that his denials during life are included in the program.â</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/57487bb333948c1a4300000a.js?muted=1\"></div></div>","rubric":"LEAVING NEVERLAND","socialTitle":"Michael Jacksonâs Family Continuing with Stage Musical in Spite of Shocking New Allegations","socialDescription":"The Michael Jackson estate hopes to bring the jukebox musical to Broadway in the summer of 2020.","seoTitle":"Michael Jacksonâs Family Continuing with Stage Musical in Spite of Shocking New Allegations","seoDescription":"The Michael Jackson estate hopes to bring the jukebox musical to Broadway in the summer of 2020.","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Movies","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","interactiveOverride":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["michael jackson"],"revisionAuthor":"Hillary Busis","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5c65b83e9e70dd2f91afe5fb","revision":33,"createdAt":"February 14, 2019 1:49 pm","modifiedAt":"February 14, 2019 4:40 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"February 14, 2019 4:40 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Hollywood","slug":"hollywood","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fae03af0739cf33e0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Movies","slug":"movies","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120c639a3587939aa6b","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"michael jackson","slug":"michael-jackson","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb8036e1c450b65047cd9","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Julie Miller is a Senior Hollywood writer for <em>Vanity Fair</em>âs website.

But <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDetective/comments/apcpv1/does_true_detective_think_they_can_just_slide/\">eagle-eyed viewers</a> paying close attention on Sunday night caught a glimpse of Rooker in a photograph&#8212;and HBO can now confirm that the <em>Walking Dead</em> and <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> star has been cast as Hoyt, the shadowy billionaire owner of Hoyt Foods in the third season of <em>True Detective.</em></p>\n<p>The <em>idea</em> of Hoyt&#8212;who still doesnât have a first name in the context of the show&#8212;was introduced early on in the series; heâs a big-game-hunting businessman whose influence over the rural Arkansas residents populating the show cannot be overstated. Itâs not unreasonable to draw a connection between <strong>Nic Pizzolattoâs</strong> fictional chicken tycoon and the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/true-detective-hoyt-daughter-gerald-kindt-bill-clinton-lucy-purcell-harris-james\">real-life Tyson Foods C.E.O. Don Tyson</a>, who also wielded massive influence in the state during the 80s and 90s. The ending of Episode 6 <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/true-detective-hoyt-pink-room-season-3-episode-6-kidnap-julie\">connected the Hoyt family directly</a> to the disappearance of young Julie Purcell by revealing that the âPink Roomâ she was held in was located in a creepily soundproofed underground section of the Hoyt family manor.</p>\n<p>Rooker himself also appeared in Episode 6 in a photo on the wall of Hoyt head of security Harris Jamesâs office. Though the episode itself doesnât call out Hoytâs identity here, his identity is clear given context clues.</p>\n<p>In Episode 5, <strong>Mahershala Aliâs</strong> Wayne says that Hoyt paid him a significant visit in 1990&#8212;a scene we have yet to see. If Hoyt is indeed the figure pulling a lot of the strings on the murders and disappearances this season of <em>True Detective,</em> then itâs understandable why Rookerâs involvement would be kept under wraps, so as to not reveal Hoytâs importance too early on in the season. Rooker is fairly well known for playing menacing characters, despite his <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</em> redemption. Which is not to guarantee that his turn as Hoyt will be pure villainy&#8212;but itâs hard to imagine otherwise at this point.</p>\n<p>Why is <em>True Detective</em> dishing up so many big answers so early in the season? My guess would be to get the âwhodunit?â of it all out of the way before the finale&#8212;which, given Rookerâs involvement and Aliâs season-long excellence, is likely to be a juicy dive into moral complexity and the chilling reach and influence of corporations.</p>","rubric":"Watching the Detectives","socialTitle":"True Detective Casts Michael Rooker in Key Role","socialDescription":"HBO taps the Walking Dead and Guardians of the Galaxy star to close out Season 3.","seoTitle":"True Detective: Michael Rooker to Play Hoyt in Season 3","seoDescription":"The Walking Dead and Guardians of the Galaxy alum to close out the season.
