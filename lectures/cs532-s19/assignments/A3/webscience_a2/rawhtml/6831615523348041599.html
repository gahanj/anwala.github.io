The president&#x2019;s eldest son, <strong>Donald Trump Jr.,</strong> bragged in 2008 that &#x201C;Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.

The project was spearheaded by Russian-born developer and longtime Trump associate <strong>Felix Sater</strong> (who <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/why-robert-mueller-has-trump-soho-in-his-sights">helped build</a> Trump SoHo) and <strong>Michael Cohen,</strong> an executive vice president at the Trump Organization and the president&#x2019;s longtime personal attorney. The deal never came to fruition.

She did not clarify whether she sat in the Russian president&#x2019;s chair.</p><p data-reactid="241">According to individuals briefed on the deal who spoke with the <em>Post,</em> the Trump Tower Moscow deal began in earnest in September 2015 only to be abandoned in January 2016, just prior to the start of the Republican primaries but after the New York real-estate company signed a letter of intent with investors. Earlier this month, Sater <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/felix-sater-man-of-mystery">confirmed the deal to</a> Talking Points Memo, but said Trump&#x2019;s candidacy derailed the Moscow plans. &#x201C;Once the campaign was really going-going, it was obvious there were going to be no deals internationally,&#x201D; Sater said. &#x201C;We were still working on it, doing something with it, November-December.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="242">In a subsequent article on Monday, the <em>Post</em> reported that Cohen e-mailed <strong>Dmitry Peskov</strong>, Putin&#x2019;s personal assistant, in an attempt to reboot the stalled development deal, according to e-mails provided to congressional investigators. Per the <em>Post</em>:</p><div data-reactid="243"><blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;Over the past few months I have been working with a company based in Russia regarding the development of a Trump Tower - Moscow project in Moscow City,&#x201D; Cohen wrote Peskov, according to a person familiar with the email. &#x201C;Without getting into lengthy specifics. the communication between our two sides has stalled.&#x201D;</p>
</blockquote></div><div data-reactid="244"><blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;As this project is too important, I am hereby requesting your assistance. I respectfully request someone, preferably you, contact me so that I might discuss the specifics as well as arranging meetings with the appropriate individuals. I thank you in advance for your assistance and look forward to hearing from you soon,&#x201D; Cohen wrote.</p>
</blockquote></div><p data-reactid="245">In a statement to the <em>Post</em>, Cohen downplayed the importance of the deal as &#x201C;simply one of many development opportunities that the Trump Organization considered and ultimately rejected.&#x201D; He also dismissed the idea that it was in any way tied to Trump&#x2019;s presidential bid, telling Congress in a statement Monday, &#x201C;The decision to pursue the proposal initially, and later to abandon it were unrelated to the Donald J. Trump for President Campaign.&#x201D; He added that he only sent the e-mail to Peskov at the urging of Sater and does not remember receiving a response. But he did also note that he discussed the Trump Tower Moscow deal with Trump on three occasions and said the president signed the letter of intent in 2015, according to an ABC News <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-knew-moscow-tower-proposal-campaign-lawyer/story?id=49472342">report</a>.</p><p data-reactid="246">The revelation that the Trump Organization reportedly sought a massive commercial real-estate deal in Moscow during the campaign may help explain why Trump was so passionate about thawing relations between the United States and Russia. Trump praised Putin on several occasions while his real-estate company was reportedly seeking the Moscow deal. During an interview with <em>Morning Joe</em> on December 18, 2015, Trump dismissed the allegations that Putin killed journalists who criticized him while simultaneously taking a swipe at <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/barack-obama#intcid=dt-hot-link">Barack Obama</a></strong>. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s running his country and at least he is a leader, unlike what we have in this country,&#x201D; Trump <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-celebrates-russias-putin-real-leader">told</a> host <strong>Joe Scarborough</strong>. He defended the Russian president again, two days later, in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/03/politics/trump-putin-russia-timeline/">an interview</a> with ABC&#x2019;s <em>Meet the Press</em>.</p><p data-reactid="247">The e-mails also belie repeated denials by both Trump and his legal team that he had any business interests in Russia. In August 2016, <strong>Alan Garten</strong> the general counsel of the Trump Organization, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/donald-trump-russia-felix-sater-227434">told Politico</a> that the company was not seeking deals in Russia and said Sater was not advising the real-estate company. Both statements may have been true at the time, but not several months earlier. (In a statement to the <em>Times</em> on Monday, the Trump Organization wrote, &#x201C;To be clear, the Trump Organization has never had any real estate holdings or interests in Russia.&#x201D;)</p><p data-reactid="248">The <em>Post</em> report is the latest in a string of recent revelations that have thrown light on Trump&#x2019;s murky relationship with Russia and Russian business interests. Last week, CNN <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/russia-revelation-highlights-trump-campaign-lie">reported</a> that <strong>Rick Dearborn,</strong> a former Trump campaign adviser who is now Trump&#x2019;s deputy chief of staff, sent an e-mail informing senior Trump campaign staffers that an individual sought to arrange a meeting between the presidential candidate and Russian President <strong>Vladimir Putin.</strong> An earlier <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/another-piece-of-the-trump-russia-puzzle-falls-into-place">report</a> revealed that a low-level Trump campaign staffer, <strong>George Papadopoulous,</strong> also tried to arrange a similar meeting. Both stories follow Trump Jr.&#x2019;s admission last month that he, <strong>Paul Manafort,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/jared-kushner#intcid=dt-hot-link">Jared Kushner</a></strong> met with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower last summer after being promised damaging information about <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/hillary-clinton#intcid=dt-hot-link">Hillary Clinton</a></strong> as part of a Russian government effort to assist their campaign.</p><p data-reactid="249">Cohen and Sater have been recurring figures in the Russian melodrama currently roiling Capitol Hill. In February, <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/donald-trump-associates-russia-ukraine">reported</a> that Cohen and Sater met with <strong>Andrii Artemenko,</strong> a member of the Ukrainian parliament, to discuss a proposal outlining how Trump could lift U.S. sanctions against Moscow. According to the <em>Times,</em> Cohen told the outlet that he hand-delivered the &#x201C;peace plan&#x201D; to then National Security Adviser <strong>Mike Flynn.</strong> (Cohen later denied that he delivered it to the former general.)</p><p data-reactid="250">Sater, who pleaded guilty for his involvement in a Mafia-related stock manipulation scheme in 1998, has also worked closely with Trump on a number of real-estate deals in the past, including the controversial Trump SoHo development. He has also been among the president&#x2019;s most earnest defenders, though the White House might have preferred he stay quiet. &#x201C;The next three years of hearings about Trump and Russia will yield absolutely nothing. I know the man, they didn&#x2019;t collude,&#x201D; he <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/08/felix-sater-donald-trump-russia-investigation.html">told</a> <em>New York</em> magazine in an interview earlier this month. &#x201C;Did a bunch of meetings happen? Absolutely. The people on the Trump team who had any access to the Russians wanted to be first in and be the guys that ran the whole d&#xE9;tente thing. Michael Flynn wanted to be the d&#xE9;tente guy, and then [Paul] Manafort, I&#x2019;m sure, wanted to be the d&#xE9;tente guy. Shit, I wanted to be the d&#xE9;tente guy, why not? But was it really a conspiracy between Putin and Donald to get him elected? A little bit of a stretch.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="251"><em>This article has been updated.</em></p><div class="mvt-variant" style="min-width:1px;min-height:1px;" data-cn-variation="_8550255229"

his campaign for president, <strong><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/people/donald-trump#intcid=dt-hot-link\">Donald Trump</a></strong> repeatedly denied having anything to do with Russia. &#x201C;I have nothing to do with Russia, nothing to do, I never met Putin, I have nothing to do with Russia whatsoever,&#x201D; he said during <a href=\"http://miami.cbslocal.com/2016/07/27/cbs4-news-exclusive-trump-denies-ties-to-russia/\">an interview</a> in July 2016.

impossible to know where to begin with the Donald, and you could write <em>War and Peace</em> and still not get close to describing the last six months of his 2016 presidential campaign&#8212;as if there’s a word that could possibly describe it. So let’s just zero in on the money.\n<p>“I’m <em>really</em> rich,” Trump declared while announcing his candidacy in June 2015. To prove it, he released a “Summary of Net Worth” balance sheet, indicating a net worth of $8,737,540,000. A month later he upwardly revised that figure to “in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.” (The caps are his.)</p>\n<p>Since then, a cottage industry of spreadsheet-diving journalists has worked itself into a lather trying to peg his real net worth. But without tax returns to go on, it’s really anybody’s guess. Despite the all-caps figures Trump has dispensed, most estimates from the established financial-media outlets have been lower, FAR LOWER. <em>Forbes</em> put his net worth at $4.5 billion. <em>Fortune</em> postulated $3.7 billion, and later upped it to $3.9 billion. Bloomberg guessed it was “closer to $2.9 billion.”</p>\n<p>In response to these wanton guesstimates, Trump instinctually fired back at the guesstimators. “<em>Forbes</em> is a bankrupt magazine, doesn’t know what they’re talking about.” “<em>Fortune</em> has no idea what my assets are” and “has totally lost its way.” But the real sulfuric acid was reserved for the lowballers over at Bloomberg. As usual, Trump made it personal, even suggesting his “friend,” the former New York City mayor, might be jealous. “Maybe Michael told them to do it,” Trump speculated in the <em>Daily Mail,</em> “because he always wanted to do what I’m doing.” Perhaps wisely, <em>The New Yorker</em>&#8212;even with its legendary phalanx of persnickety fact-checkers&#8212;wouldn’t venture any closer than “just a back-of-the-envelope calculation” of $2.56 billion, “which shouldn’t be taken too seriously.”</p>\n<p>In November, Trump was elected president of the United States in a shocking turn of events. He lost the popular vote by some two million ballots.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/donald-trump","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/27/5748bf85ee949d2f614302a8_hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-donald-trump.jpg","credit":"By John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5748bf85b58adb2f614da194","createdAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 5:43 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 522842094","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"5748bf9ab58adb2f614da195","revision":5,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"August 1, 2017 5:46 pm","uri":"people/donald-trump"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Trump Reportedly Does All His Own Makeup","promoHed":"Trump Reportedly Does All His Own Makeup","dek":"If no tanning beds exist within White House walls, what is the source of Trump’s infamous hue?","promoDek":"If no tanning beds exist within White House walls, what is the source of Trump’s infamous hue?","body":"<p>Long before <strong>President Trump</strong> decried investigations of his office over Twitter, a gentler query dogged the celebrity businessman: how does he maintain his infamous orange hue, even while residing in wintry D.C.? It’s a question that persists into the third year of Trump’s tenure in the White House, and investigations of the matter have yielded surprising insight into the commander in chief’s styling habits.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/us/politics/trump-tan.html\">The New York Times</a></em> pursued the idea as a matter of Trump’s health, though a senior administration official only offered that Trump’s notable tan&#8212;in February, no less&#8212;is the result of “good genes.” Further investigation revealed that neither tanning beds nor spray-tan booths exist within the White House or Air Force One, at least according to senior officials. Former aide <strong>Omarosa Manigault Newman</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/death-spiral-why-omarosa-totally-triggered-trump\">wrote in a tell-all book</a> that Trump travels with a tanning bed, while lighter-hued circles around the president’s eyes have fueled speculation that he utilizes goggles to protect himself from ultraviolet rays.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, neither bronzer nor tanning cream has been observed among Trump’s bathroom grooming products, at least when the president has offered a tour of the facilities to supporters. Trump, who suffers from rosacea, is reported to apply his own translucent makeup powder before television appearances, and has even adjusted the lighting at White House events to avoid appearing too orange on-screen. When possible, he prefers the natural light of the White House Rose Garden.</p>\n<p>Trump’s orange hue has also proven a frequent source of media ridicule, even as <em>Saturday Night Live</em> star <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> has suggested makeup artists deliberately avoid exaggerating the shade&#8212;at <strong>Lorne Michaels’s</strong> behest&#8212;so as “not to over-orange anything out of malice.” Baldwin has otherwise described Trump’s look as somewhere between “Mark Rothko orange” and a “slightly paler Orange Crush.”</p>\n<p>The president is famously self-sufficient when it comes to appearance, even detailing the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/photos/2015/09/an-illustrated-history-of-donald-trumps-hair\">elaborate process</a> behind his signature swooping blond hair. And while an unnamed former campaign hand admitted Trump’s orange glow is “a captivating story,” they insisted Trump’s grooming habits are his own secret to keep.</p>","rubric":"45

on Friday, and has agreed to back pay some 800,000 federal workers the salaries they missed during the previous 35-day shutdown.

A legislative source <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/429827-push-to-include-contractor-back-pay-in-funding-deal-hits-gop-roadblock\">told</a> the Hill that the administrative cost alone to pay back the contractors would be as high as the back pay itself, and that previous shutdown negotiations did not include this provision. “That was not initially part of our deal,” Senator <strong>Richard Shelby</strong> explained. “I personally would rather keep it narrow in scope.”</p>\n<p>Other Republicans, such as <strong>John Cornyn,</strong> seemed to take joy in turning contractor pain to political gain. “<strong>[Nancy] Pelosi</strong> and <strong>[Chuck] Schumer</strong> should have thought about this and other collateral damage when they initially refused to negotiate on border security, something they are apparently now willing to do,” he told NBC News. “Thousands of federal contractors have not been reimbursed from the 35-day shutdown,” Schumer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1095770911196831744\">said</a> in response to these reports. “This issue is hanging in the balance. . . . It’s just not fair.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

His Instagram bio says his job is “EVP of Development &amp; Acquisitions The @Trump Organization,” which sounds as real as anything in a high-flying world of shell companies and bad reality TV. The answer, it would appear, is that when you’re the president’s grown son, you have a lot of jobs. You <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtmPqx1AxLP/?utm_source=ig_embed\">flop around on rocks</a> to make the case for your own virility. You stand <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtyKiGwAkGm/\">so close to your dad</a> that you very nearly touch. You <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtxTm_pAOut/\">vouch for papa’s crowd size</a>, so that he might finally see that the girl isn’t the only one who can do special work in Washington. Really, you help everyone see stuff from a different perspective.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/ashleyfeinberg/status/1093214047829397504\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ashleyfeinberg/status/1093214047829397504\">https://twitter.com/ashleyfeinberg/status/1093214047829397504</a></p></blockquote></div><p>And you have to sit front row at New York Fashion Week. Get you a large adult son who can do both, as they say.</p>\n<p>Trump Jr. attended Malaysian designer <strong>Zang Toi’s</strong> show at Spring Studios on Wednesday. His look for the night was salt-and-pepper beard. Against all known <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/science-explains-why-a-beard-makes-you-look-hotter_n_6618142\">beard science, which states men look better with beards</a>, his look is more of a bot that is getting better and better at this smiling thing every day. His family <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2018/11/26/lead-pamela-brown-dnt-trump-ignoring-everything-jake-tapper.cnn\">has not put much faith in science</a>, anyway.</p>\n<p>Junior’s ex-stepmother, <strong>Marla Maples,</strong> was there, too, sitting a cool three seats away from him&#8212;close enough to look like they’re a part of one big party, and far enough away that she could convincingly avoid eye contact. (In past years, <a href=\"https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/presidents-former-wife-a-regular-zang-toi-10987395/\">Toi has invited</a> Junior’s mom and the president’s first ex-wife, <strong>Ivana Trump.</strong>) Between the biggest Trump boy and Maples was Fox News’ <em>America’s Newsroom</em> host <strong>Bill Hemmer</strong> and Fox News personality-turned-Don Jr’s girlfriend <strong>Kimberly Guilfoyle.</strong></p>\n<p>There at the fashion show, Junior told the press that he’s dating a cool girl. She fishes and shoots guns, he said, but also wears makeup and the fashions. “[Guilfoyle has] even been out with me down to Texas with some of my buddies there. They all go, ‘Hey, it’s a guy camp. Are you sure she’s going to be O.K.?’ I’m like, ‘Don’t worry, boys. I’m making you sign a waiver. She’s going to destroy all of you,’” he <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/02/13/donald-trump-jr-and-kimberly-guilfoyle-to-keep-it-low-key-for-valentines-day/\">told</a> the <em>New York Post.</em></p>\n<p>Toi’s finale look was an American flag skirt that could very well come to a <strong>Joy Villa</strong> near you next fall. (Wow, can’t believe this guy is co-signing a person dragging the American flag on the floor like that. What a shame&#8212;it’s like he doesn’t even respect America anymore, etc.) The designer made a special stop at the end of the runway to kiss Guilfoyle and shake Don’s hand. Who knows what he’s thinking as he smiles down at the designer. My best guess? “She’s going to destroy all of you,” over and over again, forever.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The dirty truth about <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/the-dirty-secret-of-el-chapo-downfall?inline\">El Chapo’s downfall</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; That time <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/brian-rea-modern-love-death-wins-a-goldfish?inline\">death took a break</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The 25 <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/25-best-movie-scenes?inline\">most influential movie scenes</a> of the past 25 years</p>\n<p>&#8212; Acupuncture and hypno-birthing?

Let Koch’s expert on water and chemical regulations decide.","body":"<p>Of all the federal agencies that fall under <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> purview, none embodies the administration’s unofficial mandate to do the exact opposite of its stated mission quite like the Environmental Protection Agency. For the last two years, the E.P.A.&#8212;which, as a reminder, is supposed to be protecting human health and the environment&#8212;has done everything in its power to turn the planet into an ashtray and convince Americans that toxic chemicals are actually totally fine to drink, breathe, and otherwise ingest, all in an effort to help companies secreting those chemicals maximize their profits. Which is to say, we probably should have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/04/former-koch-official-runs-epa-chemical-research-1136230\">seen this one coming</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Trump administration has placed a former Koch Industries official in charge of research that will shape how the government regulates a class of toxic chemicals contaminating millions of Americans’ drinking water&#8212;an issue that could have major financial repercussions for his former employer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Dunlap,</strong> a deputy in E.P.A.’s Office of Research and Development, is playing a key role as the agency decides how to protect people from the pollution left behind at hundreds of military bases and factories across the country. . .He spent the previous eight years as Koch Industries’ lead expert on water and chemical regulations, a position that typically includes helping companies to limit regulatory restrictions and liability for cleanups.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dunlap was hired in October, according to previously undisclosed documents. Since then, he has been extremely busy, having reportedly been involved in high-level meetings that preceded the agency’s decision <em>not</em> to set drinking water limits for chemicals known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which “have been linked with kidney and testicular cancer, as well as other ailments.” (In a statement, <strong>David Ross</strong>, EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Water, told the Hive: “Despite what is being reported, EPA has not finalized or publicly issued its PFAS management plan, and any information that speculates what is included in the plan is premature. The agency is committed to following the Safe Drinking Water Act process for evaluating new drinking water standards, which is just one of the many components of the draft plan that is currently undergoing interagency review.”) According to Politico, Dunlap has been able to avoid a Senate confirmation hearing in which his prior work experience might come up because Trump has not officially nominated anyone to run to office. (Dunlap’s <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/research/david-dunlap\">official bio</a> on the E.P.A. Web site declines to mention any of his employers during his “more than 30 years” working for “private industry, trade associations and as an environmental consultant.”) Currently, Koch subsidiary Georgia-Pacific, a paper and pulp conglomerate, is facing at least one class-action suit related to chemicals now under Dunlap’s purview.</p>\n<p>Koch’s various environmental crimes against humanity are laid out in several high-profile lawsuits over the past 20 years. According to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111005022145/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-02/koch-brothers-flout-law-getting-richer-with-secret-iran-sales.html\">Bloomberg</a>, “Koch Industries was assessed more than $400 million in fines, penalties, and judgments” between 1999 and 2003, such as for dumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of aviation fuel into a Minnesota wetland. “You want an independent, hardheaded scientific review of these issues; you don’t want somebody who is already taking the industry party line,” <strong>Erik Olson,</strong> who heads up the Natural Resources Defense Council’s public health work, told Politico. “There’s a legitimate threat there and, from my perspective, the conflicts of interest that [Dunlap] has having worked as a regulatory compliance director at Georgia-Pacific raises questions about whether he can make those objective decisions or should be recused.”</p>\n<p>Dunlap, of course, is unlikely to be replaced by someone without a host of conflicts of interest given that the guy currently running the E.P.A., <strong>Andrew Wheeler,</strong> is a walking, talking conflict of interest, having <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/07/06/626525274/get-to-know-andrew-wheeler-ex-coal-lobbyist-with-inside-track-to-lead-epa\">served as a coal-lobbyist</a> prior to taking over the top job from departed Grift King <strong>Scott Pruitt.</strong> It is, in other words, par for the course.

The president showed up about 40 minutes late to his planned speech Friday morning in the Rose Garden and immediately began rambling about trade negotiations with China. He proceeded to go on a long tangent about trade, Brexit, Syria, and his plans for a second summit with North Korea’s <strong>Kim Jong Un,</strong> all without the use of a teleprompter. Eventually he got to the point. “I’m going to be signing a national emergency,” Trump said. According to White House officials, the declaration will allow Trump to redirect $3.6 billion from the military, $2.5 billion from counter-narcotics programs, and $600 million from the Treasury to build a border wall that Congress refused to fund.</p>\n<p>Trump appeared resigned to being sued for what both Democrats and Republicans have denounced as an unconstitutional power grab. “We will have a national emergency, and we will then be <em>sued,</em>” he explained, breaking into a strange sing-song voice. “And they will sue us in the Ninth <em>Circuit,</em> even though it <em>shouldn’t</em> be there, and we will possibly get a bad <em>ruling,</em> and then we’ll get another bad <em>ruling,</em> and then we’ll end up in the Supreme <em>Court,</em> and hopefully we’ll get a fair <em>shake,</em> and we’ll win in the Supreme <em>Court</em> just like the <em>ban.</em>”</p>\n<p>The government lawyers who will inevitably have to argue that case were surely appalled by what came next. “We have so much money. But on the wall, they skimped,” he said, complaining that Congress had not given him the $5.7 billion in funding he wanted. “I didn’t need to do this,” he added, potentially undermining any legal justification for an emergency declaration. “But I’d rather do it much faster.”</p>\n<p>It is hard to capture in text the utter strangeness of the entire incoherent, self-defeating monologue. As always with Trump, the <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?457952-1/president-trump-sign-national-emergency-build-border-wall&amp;vod&amp;start=34\">full video</a> needs to be seen to be believed. But for those who can’t bring themselves to watch 50 minutes of the president praising himself and berating reporters, here are the most absurd highlights:</p>\n<p><strong>On other emergency declarations:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s been signed many times before. It’s been signed by other presidents. From 1977 or so, it gave the presidents the power. There’s rarely been a problem. They sign it; nobody cares. I guess they weren’t very exciting. But nobody cares. They sign it for far less important things in some cases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On executing drug dealers:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[In China] a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty. Our . . . drug dealer gets a thing called, “How about a fine?” . . .  So if we want to get smart, we can get smart. You can end the drug problem&#8212;can end it a lot faster than you think.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On Paul Ryan, who advised him against focusing on the wall:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will tell you, I’m very disappointed at certain people&#8212;particularly one&#8212;for not having pushed this faster.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On his biggest conservative fans:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Look, <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do. Not of me. If I change my views, he wouldn&#39;t be with me. <strong>Rush Limbaugh:</strong> I think he’s a great guy. Here’s a guy who could speak for three hours without a phone call. Try doing that sometime. For three hours, he speaks. He’s got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world. I mean, this guy is unbelievable. Try speaking for three hours without taking calls. Taking calls is easy. “O.K., I&#39;ll answer this one, that one.” He goes for three hours and he’s got an audience that’s fantastic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On his friendship with dictator Kim Jong Un:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was a very tough dialogue at the beginning. Fire and fury. Total annihilation. “My button is bigger than yours” and “my button works.” . . . [But] I like him a lot and he likes me a lot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On Ann Coulter, who has called his emergency declaration a scam:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ann Coulter,</strong> I don’t know her. I hardly know her. I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year. but the press loves saying “Ann Coulter.” Probably if I did speak to her, she’d be very nice. I just don’t have the time . . . I would speak to her, I have nothing against her. . . . But she&#39;s off the reservation. But anybody that knows her understands that. But I haven’t spoken to her. I don’t follow her. I don’t talk to her. But the press loves to bring up the name “Ann Coulter.” And you know what, I think she’s fine. . . . I just don’t speak to her.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On where he gets his (debunked) statistics on immigration:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I get my numbers from a lot of sources, like Homeland Security, primarily. And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster. And you know what else is a disaster? The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, <strong>Kirstjen [Nielsen],</strong> for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration. Billions and billions of dollars a month. Billions and billions of dollars and it’s unnecessary. . . . I use many stats . . . you have stats far worse than the ones I use, but I use many stats. But I also use Homeland Security.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On why he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, Part I:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think the people understand what we do. . . . Prime Minister <strong>[Shinzō] Abe</strong> [gave me]&#8212;it’s the most beautiful five-page letter. Nobel Prize. He sent it to them. You know why? Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan. And they had alarms going off&#8212;you know that. Now, all of a sudden, they feel good. They feel safe. I did that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On why he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, Part II:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you look at Idlib Province in Syria, I stopped the slaughter of perhaps three million people, nobody talk about that. . . . Russia and Iran and Syria were going to go in and perhaps destroy three million people in order to get 45,000 terrorists. And I heard about it from a woman who had her parents and her brother living there. And she said, “Please, please.” And I thought&#8212;I said, “No. It can’t happen. What are you talking about it?” “No, they’re going to. ” And I come home and I read a certain paper where the story was there, that they were actually forming to go into&#8212;to, really, to really do big destruction. And I put out a statement that, “You’d better not do it.” And in all fairness to Russia and Iran and Syria, they didn’t attack. Or they’re doing it surgically, at least.

troops depart.","promoDek":"America’s allies “unanimously” declined the Trump administration’s request to pick up the slack in Syria when U.S. troops depart.","body":"<p>Yet again, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has jumped the gun. Last week, the Trump administration revealed plans to remove all American troops from Syria by the end of April&#8212;a position long championed by the president. The move rankled even some congressional allies like Senator <strong>Lindsey Graham,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">apparently</a> made his displeasure known to Acting Defense Secretary <strong>Patrick Shanahan</strong> over the weekend. Now, it’s clear lawmakers weren’t the only ones blindsided by the planned withdrawal&#8212;key United States allies appear to have been left out of the loop as well.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/allies-say-they-wont-remain-in-syria-after-us-troops-withdraw/2019/02/20/62e503b2-3532-11e9-a400-e481bf264fdc_story.html?utm_term=.9c6870c65501\">reported</a> that U.S. allies “unanimously” declined the Trump administration’s request to pick up the slack fighting ISIS in Syria if the U.S. removes its troops in the spring, as Trump has apparently directed Shanahan to do. A senior administration official told the <em>Post</em> that allies have made it clear they “won’t stay if you pull out.” Trump’s hasty move, then, could leave behind a powder keg. “It’s not safe to leave these enemies there, without any referee or mediating force,” said a U.S. official.</p>\n<p>His approach to Syria is the latest example of Trump’s seeming tendency to push policy without working out the details, which has frustrated even some of his closest allies. “That’s the dumbest fucking idea I’ve ever heard,” Graham evidently <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">told</a> Shanahan of Trump’s withdrawal plan in a meeting in Munich last Saturday. The South Carolina Republican, normally a staunch defender of the president, has been venting about the administration’s Syria policy since December, when Trump suddenly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/donald-trump-syria-troops\">announced</a> it would be up to other nations to fight ISIS there&#8212;despite also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1075397797929775105\">claiming</a> that the terrorist organization had been “defeated.” Graham torched the policy, saying at the time that he would “hold the administration accountable for this decision,” and threatened hearings over the planned move.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to imagine that any president would wake up and make this kind of decision with this little communication,” Republican Senator <strong>Bob Corker</strong> said at the time.</p>\n<p>But it appears that’s precisely how Trump has approached one of the most complicated foreign-policy conundrums of his presidency. While the commander-in-chief seemingly continues to talk out of his ass&#8212;on Friday, he said he would announce the “eradication of the caliphate . . . over the next 24 hours,” but no such announcement has come&#8212;U.S. allies appear to be losing patience. Last week, French Foreign Minister <strong>Jean-Yves Le Drian</strong> <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/u-s-pullout-from-syria-benefits-iran-says-french-fm-1.6938647\">called</a> Trump’s call for withdrawal a “mystery,” and British Foreign Secretary <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> has said that “there is no prospect of British forces replacing the Americans” in Syria. Their pushback has left Trump hanging. Whether it will be enough to force him to reconsider remains to be seen.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a

controversy.","promoDek":"The president’s daughter downplayed the project&#8212;and distanced herself from the controversy.","body":"<p>In the wake of recent reporting detailing <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> efforts to build a Trump Tower in Russia during the presidential campaign, <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> appeared Friday on ABC to downplay the controversial real-estate project&#8212;and put some distance between herself and the president. Asked by <strong>Abby Huntsman</strong> whether she had any concerns about the project, the senior White House adviser <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/08/politics/ivanka-trump-russia-investigation/index.html\">responded</a> that she knew “literally almost nothing” about a Trump Organization proposal to build a skyscraper in downtown Moscow, and said she had “zero concern” that anyone in her family could be implicated in <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> investigation into Russian efforts to fix the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Of course, Ivanka’s account differs somewhat from various reports suggesting she knew a great deal about the project. According to <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/mueller-eyes-ivanka-don-jr-s-work-trump-tower-moscow-003012099.html\">Yahoo News</a>, both she and <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong> were involved in the project as far back as 2013, and were aware that former Trump lawyer <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> had been working to revive the deal. In October 2015, Trump Sr. signed a letter of intent to move forward with negotiations, but has continued to be evasive about the extent of his ambitions. In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress about the scope of the Trump Tower project, and BuzzFeed News recently reported that the president directed Cohen to say that those negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did, though the special counsel’s office issued an unusual statement disputing the BuzzFeed story as “not accurate.”</p>\n<p>According to the contested BuzzFeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation\">report</a>, both Ivanka and Trump Jr. received “regular, detailed updates” about the project from Cohen. Ivanka would reportedly have managed a spa at the tower, and per BuzzFeed, instructed Cohen to speak with a Russian athlete who had “synergy on a government level” to move the project along. A spokesperson for the First Daughter’s attorney told BuzzFeed that she was only “minimally involved” in proceedings, and “did not know about this proposal until after a non-binding letter of intent had been signed.” Her older brother, meanwhile, has testified under oath that he was only “peripherally aware” of the plans.</p>\n<p>She contested the Yahoo report too, insisting that her involvement in the project was limited to recommending an architect. But in her interview with Huntsman, she offered additional explanations: the Moscow deal was one of many she was juggling, she was too busy to have paid much attention, and it never moved beyond a theoretical stage. “There was never a binding contract,” she told Huntsman during the <em>Good Morning America</em> interview, part of which aired Friday. “I never talked to the&#8212;with a third party outside of the organization about it. It was one of&#8212;I mean, we could have had 40 or 50 deals like that, that were floating around, that somebody was looking at. Nobody visited it to see if it was worth our time. So this was not exactly like an advanced project.”</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing there, yet it’s created weeks and weeks and months of headlines,” she added. “So no, I have zero concern.”</p>\n<h3>More

Now Democrats want to know if Matthew Whitaker committed some light perjury.","body":"<p>Over at <em>The New York Times</em> today, you will find <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-investigations.html\">a lengthy look</a> at the various tactics <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has employed over the last two years in his ongoing attempts to defang the many, many investigations into his conduct. Chief among them, of course, have been Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-attacks-obstruction-investigation.html\">1,200 or so</a> public attacks on individuals and groups connected to inquiries into potential collusion between his campaign and Russia. (Trump has called <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> investigation a “witch hunt” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=witch%20hunt%20from%3Arealdonaldtrump&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en\">dozens of times on Twitter</a>; other times he just blurts “witch hunt!” without any context whatsoever.) There’s also the time he <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/donald-trump-fires-fbi-director-james-comey\">fired</a> the director of the F.B.I.; the private campaign to remove <strong>Jeff Sessions</strong> for failing to “protect him”; and the hiring of <strong>Rudy Giuliani,</strong> whose job has been to wage a public-relations war to “undermine the credibility of both Mr. Mueller and the Justice Department,” which has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/rudy-giuliani-robert-mueller-collusion-russia\">not worked out so well</a>. More recently, the president apparently used some precious hours of “Executive Time” to try to install a friendly face atop the investigation into his hush-money payments during the election.</p>\n<p>Last year, according to the <em>Times,</em> Trump summoned his newly installed acting attorney general, <strong>Matthew Whitaker</strong>&#8212;the one he claimed to not know despite <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/trump-denies-knowing-whitaker-who-he-met-a-dozen-times.html\">meeting with him on at least 12 separate occasions</a>&#8212;to ask him a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1068442531887632384\">very legal and very cool</a> question. Could <strong>Geoffrey Berman,</strong> the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, take over the investigation into <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-played-central-role-in-hush-payoffs-to-stormy-daniels-and-karen-mcdougal-1541786601\">Trump’s role</a> in paying porn star <strong>Stormy Daniels</strong> and former <em>Playboy</em> model <strong>Karen McDougal</strong> to keep quiet about their alleged affairs? In Berman, Trump obviously saw the perfect guy for the job, given his background as the son of a real-estate developer; his time <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/10/top-ny-prosecutor-geoffrey-berman-trump-appointee-recused-michael-cohen-inquiry/502367002/\">as a principal at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/rudy-giuliani-greenberg-traurig-resignation\">which previously employed Giuliani until the association likely became too mortifying to bear</a>; and his <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-thought-hed-picked-his-perfect-us-attorney-in-geoffrey-berman-he-was-very-wrong\">hefty donation to the Trump campaign in 2016</a>. In Whitaker, too, Trump presumably saw a guy with a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/matthew-whitaker-world-patent-marketing-scam\">somewhat elastic view of right and wrong</a>, who would be eager to do his bidding. But alas! It was not to be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Whitaker, who had privately told associates that part of his role at the Justice Department was to “jump on a grenade” for the president, knew he could not put Mr. Berman in charge because Mr. Berman had already recused himself from the investigation. The president soon soured on Mr. Whitaker, as he often does with his aides, and complained about his inability to pull levers at the Justice Department that could make the president’s many legal problems go away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The revelation not only highlights Trump’s continued reliance on <em>Sopranos</em>-esque tactics while working in the White House, but also puts Whitaker in an awkward situation vis-à-vis potentially lying to Congress:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Whitaker, who this month told a congressional committee that Mr. Trump had never pressured him over the various investigations, is now under scrutiny by House Democrats for possible perjury.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A spokeswoman for the Justice Department told the <em>Times</em> that the White House never asked Whitaker to interfere in the hush-money investigation. “Under oath to the House Judiciary Committee, then-Acting Attorney General Whitaker stated that ‘at no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel’s investigation or any other investigation,’” said <strong>Kerri Kupec.</strong> “Mr. Whitaker stands by his testimony.” Meanwhile, it will undoubtedly shock you to hear that Trump has dubbed the whole thing “fake news”:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962\">https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962</a></p></blockquote></div><h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Storms’-a-brewin","socialTitle":"Report: Trump Tried to Muzzle Investigation into His Porno Payoffs","socialDescription":"The president thought he could install a friendly face atop the probe.

funds from “other sources.”","body":"<p>In the latest blow to his deal-maker persona, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> appears poised to sign the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/congress-reaches-deal-to-fund-quarter-of-trump-border-wall\">border-security deal</a> a bipartisan panel of Capitol Hill negotiators struck late Monday, despite the fact that it allots the president <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/12/18221468/congress-border-security-deal\">less money</a> in barrier funding than he was offered last year, before he shut down the government for five weeks. The president has made clear he’s no fan of the agreement, but with no Republican appetite for a second shutdown or unilateral action by the White House, and a Friday deadline looming, he may not have much of a choice&#8212;even as he leaves open the possibility of finding “other sources” to get the sum he’s spent months demanding. “I’m not happy about it,” Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/12/trump-meeting-cant-say-happy-border-deal-remarks-ip-vpx.cnn\">told reporters</a> of the deal on Tuesday. “It’s not doing the trick. But I’m adding things to it, and when you add whatever I have to add&#8212;it’s all gonna happen where we’re gonna build a beautiful, big, strong wall.”</p>\n<p>“It’s very simple,” he said.</p>\n<p>It makes sense that Trump isn’t thrilled about the deal. It includes just $1.375 billion for border fencing&#8212;far less than the nearly $6 billion he’d been seeking to build a concrete wall, and less even than the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/418507-schumer-dems-oppose-spending-more-than-16b-on-border-security\">$1.6 billion</a> <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> had offered him before Trump shut down the government last year. For the guy who authored <em>Art of the Deal,</em> it’s unquestionably a defeat&#8212;a fact his base has already picked up on. Rep. <strong>Mark Meadows,</strong> one of Trump’s top Hill allies, said on Monday that the bill “does not represent a fraction of what the president has promised the American people” and suggested he shouldn’t sign it. <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> Trump’s Fox News id, called the funding measure a “garbage compromise” when details first emerged.</p>\n<p>But Hannity has since softened, saying he’s “not as concerned” about Trump signing what he’d previously described as an “insane” deal&#8212;as long as he also declares a national emergency to get the rest of the money for the wall. “The president would need to declare a national emergency,” Hannity <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2019/02/12/sean-hannity-says-declaring-national-emergency-border-necessity/222852\">said</a> Tuesday. “This is the time. That is a necessity.” Trump, too, has hinted that he could pull additional cash from “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1095469449052868610\">other sources</a>,” a possible reference to the nuclear option he’s been threatening for weeks. “Was just presented the concept and parameters of the Border Security Deal by hard working Senator <strong>Richard Shelby,</strong>” Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1095469447933059073\">tweeted</a> Tuesday evening. “Looking over all aspects knowing that this will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources. . . . Regardless of Wall money, it is being built as we speak!”</p>\n<p>There is more than one way for the White House to tap those “other sources,” although each comes with potential legal hurdles. As Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/11/mick-mulvaney-border-wall-funds-1163996\">reported</a> on Monday, the White House has already developed plans to redirect unspent federal dollars as part of an executive order that would bypass Congress without requiring an emergency declaration. “There are certain sums of money that are available to the president, to any president,” Chief of Staff <strong>Mick Mulvaney</strong> explained Sunday on <em>Meet the Press.</em> “So you comb through the law at the president&#39;s request . . . And there’s pots of money where presidents, all presidents, have access to without a national emergency.” Experts say the move would almost certainly provoke a challenge.</p>\n<p>For now, at least, Trump’s signature on the bipartisan border deal would avert another destructive shutdown. But it’s not a done deal just yet. While the funding measure was agreed to in principle, Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2019/02/13/is-the-border-wall-deal-in-danger-of-falling-apart-392261\">reported</a> Wednesday that lawmakers have discovered some unresolved areas of contention as they’ve worked to finalize it. That could be troublesome with a Friday deadline fast approaching&#8212;especially when the ultimate decision comes down to an unpredictable president whose whims can change with the wind.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

Republicans’ grip on the federal purse strings, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is set to bypass Congress and use the nuclear option to build his long-promised wall at the United States-Mexico border. It’s a move that will trigger a tough, protracted legal fight&#8212;and one that could even cause a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/trump-declares-national-emergency-border-wall-funding\">rift within the G.O.P.</a>, where leadership previously warned the president against an emergency declaration.</p>\n<p>Democrats, naturally, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/national-emergency-blocked-courts-temporarily-doj-warns-white/story?id=61086962\">labeled</a> the move “crazy,” “ridiculous,” and something “all of us will come to regret.” But Thursday also saw renewed cries of alarm from Republicans. Senator <strong>Susan Collins,</strong> who has criticized Trump in the past, released a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorCollins/status/1096175131733475330\">statement</a> calling the administration’s plan B a “mistake.” “Such a declaration would undermine the role of Congress and the appropriations process,” Collins said, warning of the precedent it could set. Kentucky Senator <strong>Rand Paul,</strong> a proponent of limited government, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096149684840738816\">told a reporter</a> he was “not in favor” of the plan, saying that “revenue raising and spending power was given to Congress” and suggesting that going around lawmakers would be an abuse of executive power. And Alaska Senator <strong>Lisa Murkowski,</strong> who’s stood up to the administration before, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096151375875133440\">said</a> she “[doesn’t] think this is a matter that should be declared a national emergency.”</p>\n<p>“I wish he wouldn’t have done it,” Senator <strong>Chuck Grassley</strong> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/14/gop-national-emergency-declaration-trump-1170697\">told</a> Politico. “I imagine we’ll find out whether he’s got the authority to do it by the courts.”</p>\n<p>“I never thought that was a good idea,” Republican Senator <strong>Pat Toomey</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096153688681467905\">told a reporter</a>. “I still don’t.”</p>\n<p>Trump had long suggested he’d employ the nuclear option, having previously called the bipartisan talks that led to this week’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/congress-reaches-deal-to-fund-quarter-of-trump-border-wall\">border-security agreement</a> a “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/trump-great-negotiator-gives-up-on-negotiating-border-wall-national-emergency\">waste of time</a>.” He’d even <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/republicans-think-trump-nuclear-option-national-emergency-is-a-terrible-idea\">implied</a> that he would declare a national emergency during his State of the Union address earlier this month, but ultimately decided against it amid bipartisan backlash&#8212;including from Senate Majority Leader <strong>Mitch McConnell.</strong></p>\n<p>Now, though, Trump is planning to sign the bipartisan deal <em>and</em> employ the nuclear option. That will likely please his base, including <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> who signaled this week that the only way he’d give his blessing to the “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-prepares-to-sign-garbage-compromise-on-border-wall-funding\">garbage compromise</a>” would be if the president accompanied his signature with a national emergency. It’ll also please some of his Capitol Hill allies, including <strong>Lindsey Graham,</strong> who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GarrettHaake/status/1096144722215743489\">said</a> Thursday that “this is a political fight worth having.”</p>\n<p>It remains to be seen whether pushback from lawmakers can overcome the kudos from Trump’s base. That, after all, is one of the defining problems of Republican criticisms of Trump: that his detractors, time and again, have proven far more pliable than his allies. McConnell, who had previously opposed the nuclear option, announced his support on the Senate floor Thursday. And even those who expressed concern with the maneuver seemingly left themselves wiggle room. Take <strong>Marco Rubio:</strong> the Florida Republican indicated he believes Trump may be violating the Constitution if he bypasses Congress to build the wall&#8212;but only went so far as to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenRubioPress/status/1096172609392254978\">say</a> he is “skeptical it will be something [he] can support.” “I will wait to see what statutory or constitutional power the President relies on to justify such a declaration before making any definitive statement,” he said.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and

But in declaring a national emergency, the president risks a constitutional challenge&#8212;and causing lasting damage to the institution of Congress.","body":"<p>President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> will declare a national emergency to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, the White House confirmed Thursday afternoon, shortly after Senate Majority Leader <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> strode onto the Senate floor to announce that he would support the president’s power grab. “President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action&#8212;including a national emergency&#8212;to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis,” Press Secretary <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Trump had <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-wall-national-emergency-shutdown\">long threatened</a> to use his executive authority to build the wall if Democrats refused to give him the $5.7 billion he had demanded, despite the protestations of lawmakers in his own party. McConnell himself <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/mcconnell-privately-cautioned-trump-about-emergency-declaration-on-border-wall/2019/02/01/5ff1262c-2646-11e9-81fd-b7b05d5bed90_story.html\">previously warned</a> the president against declaring a national emergency, concerned it would split the Republican Party. In <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-01/trump-hints-he-ll-discuss-border-emergency-at-state-of-union\">recent days</a>, Trump reportedly convened his staff and advisers to begin drafting a national-emergency declaration for the wall, as it became clear that the omnibus budget would not include money for his signature campaign promise; the latest iteration allocated just $1.375 billion for 55 miles of barriers, fencing, and other security measures. Conservatives, including some of Trump’s top allies on Capitol Hill, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-prepares-to-sign-garbage-compromise-on-border-wall-funding\">panned the deal</a>. Fox News host <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> perhaps the president’s most influential outside adviser, called it a “garbage compromise.”</p>\n<p>The president’s inability to build the wall, even when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, has been a continuing personal embarrassment. By declaring a national emergency, Trump can appease his base and save face&#8212;but he also risks a massive court battle. The move will likely trigger a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/01/trump-has-no-case-national-emergency/581356/\">constitutional challenge</a>, as it directly circumvents Congress’s power of the purse to address an emergency wholly manufactured by the president. Despite Trump’s insistence that there is a crisis at the border, illegal border crossings are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/11/us/politics/trump-border-crisis-reality.html\">down substantially</a> over the last two decades. While there is a very real <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-theres-a-crisis-at-the-border-heres-what-the-data-says\">asylum crisis</a> at the border, the vast majority of people seeking refuge in the United States, such as members of several recent “caravans,” typically present themselves at ports of entry in order to apply for protected status.</p>\n<p>Legal experts believe <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/trump-national-emergency.html?module=inline\">Trump could win</a> a court challenge over his authority to militarize border-wall construction, and the White House has been preparing for that eventuality. Asked Thursday if they are prepared to litigate a national-emergency declaration, Sanders said, “We’re very prepared, but there shouldn’t be [legal challenges]. The president’s doing his job. Congress should do theirs.”</p>\n<p>The larger problem identified by Republican critics is the precedent Trump would set by usurping Congress. After all, if Trump can decide that something qualifies as an emergency when he doesn’t get his way, what’s to stop a future Democratic president from deciding that something like climate change&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">an actual, global threat to humanity</a>&#8212;can be addressed by executive fiat? Trump himself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/535441553079431168\">tweeted</a> in 2014, “Repubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit &amp; because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, shortly after Sanders confirmed Trump’s intent to declare an emergency, House Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> issued a stark warning to Republicans. “Just think what a president with different values can present to the American people,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/politico/status/1096153922228703233\">she said</a> during a press conference Thursday. “You want to talk about a national emergency? Let’s talk about today, the one-year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America. That’s a national emergency. Why don’t you declare that an emergency, Mr. President? I wish you would, but a Democratic president can do that. A Democratic president can declare other emergencies as well.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Emergency Wall","socialTitle":"Trump Chooses the Nuclear Option to Build His Border Wall","socialDescription":"The president hopes to save face after a stinging legislative defeat.

Asked by <strong>Abby Huntsman</strong> whether she had any concerns about the project, the senior White House adviser <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/08/politics/ivanka-trump-russia-investigation/index.html\">responded</a> that she knew “literally almost nothing” about a Trump Organization proposal to build a skyscraper in downtown Moscow, and said she had “zero concern” that anyone in her family could be implicated in <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> investigation into Russian efforts to fix the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Of course, Ivanka’s account differs somewhat from various reports suggesting she knew a great deal about the project. According to <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/mueller-eyes-ivanka-don-jr-s-work-trump-tower-moscow-003012099.html\">Yahoo News</a>, both she and <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong> were involved in the project as far back as 2013, and were aware that former Trump lawyer <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> had been working to revive the deal. In October 2015, Trump Sr. signed a letter of intent to move forward with negotiations, but has continued to be evasive about the extent of his ambitions. In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress about the scope of the Trump Tower project, and BuzzFeed News recently reported that the president directed Cohen to say that those negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did, though the special counsel’s office issued an unusual statement disputing the BuzzFeed story as “not accurate.”</p>\n<p>According to the contested BuzzFeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation\">report</a>, both Ivanka and Trump Jr. received “regular, detailed updates” about the project from Cohen. Ivanka would reportedly have managed a spa at the tower, and per BuzzFeed, instructed Cohen to speak with a Russian athlete who had “synergy on a government level” to move the project along. A spokesperson for the First Daughter’s attorney told BuzzFeed that she was only “minimally involved” in proceedings, and “did not know about this proposal until after a non-binding letter of intent had been signed.” Her older brother, meanwhile, has testified under oath that he was only “peripherally aware” of the plans.</p>\n<p>She contested the Yahoo report too, insisting that her involvement in the project was limited to recommending an architect. But in her interview with Huntsman, she offered additional explanations: the Moscow deal was one of many she was juggling, she was too busy to have paid much attention, and it never moved beyond a theoretical stage. “There was never a binding contract,” she told Huntsman during the <em>Good Morning America</em> interview, part of which aired Friday. “I never talked to the&#8212;with a third party outside of the organization about it. It was one of&#8212;I mean, we could have had 40 or 50 deals like that, that were floating around, that somebody was looking at. Nobody visited it to see if it was worth our time. So this was not exactly like an advanced project.”</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing there, yet it’s created weeks and weeks and months of headlines,” she added. “So no, I have zero concern.”</p>\n<h3>More

Now, taped conversations reveal Wolkoff’s concerns with how money was being spent, the general chaos of the process, the involvement of the Trump family, and the people in charge, namely Rick Gates and Tom Barrack.","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Last summer, months after federal agents executed search warrants on his home, office, and hotel room&#8212;seizing more than a dozen devices and hundreds of records&#8212;<strong>Michael Cohen</strong> made a phone call to <strong>Stephanie Winston Wolkoff.</strong> For years, Cohen and Wolkoff had operated in a shared milieu. Both lived on the same block on the Upper East Side. More notably, both were crucial supporting players in the Trump orbit. Cohen had been an indefatigable booster of <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> helping to arrange his real-estate deals, paying off alleged mistresses, and quashing would-be damaging stories regarding his boss. Wolkoff, for a time, was a lesser-known, but equally diligent enforcer for <strong>Melania Trump.</strong></p>\n<p>The two women had met years earlier, when Wolkoff helped produce the Metropolitan Museum’s Costume Institute Benefit. (<strong>Anna Wintour,</strong> who hosts the gala, is editor-in-chief of <em>Vogue</em> and the artistic director of Condé Nast, <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s parent company.) Over the years, Wolkoff would become a member of Melania’s small inner circle. After Trump’s surprise electoral-college victory, she went on to help the First Lady in Washington, serving as a senior adviser to her official governmental office on matters large and small. Wolkoff helped facilitate Melania’s transition to the White House, and advised her on policy platforms, East Wing décor, and her overall messaging.</p>\n<p>The two were close enough that Wolkoff could openly express divergent views. According to sources familiar with the conversations, Wolkoff told Melania and East Wing staffers that the name for her anti-bullying initiative, “Be Best,” sounded illiterate. (The First Lady, according to these sources, feared that an alternative, “Children First,” was too similar to her husband’s “America First” branding.) They also disagreed about the infamous “I Really Don’t Care, Do U?” jacket that the First Lady wore to the U.S.-Mexico border. (Melania, according to these sources, thought the trip would not get attention without such a brazen fashion gesture. In an interview with ABC News in October, she said that she wore the jacket for the media and people who were criticizing her, and wondered aloud whether the trip would have received similar attention without it.) But the two women remained close, nevertheless. On trips to D.C., Wolkoff would sometimes spend the night in the White House residence; other times, she would book a room in the Trump International Hotel down Pennsylvania Avenue. According to e-mail exchanges from the time, she was given the friends and family rate of $345 a night, and told to submit receipts to <strong>Reince Priebus.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/c97a4730-bc95-4032-b21a-a970764c038c?customColor=%23ff0000\"><iframe height=\"220\" width=\"750\" src=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/c97a4730-bc95-4032-b21a-a970764c038c?customColor=%23ff0000\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong><em>iTunes user?

Cohen, of course, went from being one of the president’s closest confidants to one of his most bitter and dangerous adversaries. Wolkoff’s separation was less public, but is increasingly newsworthy. Through her company, WIS Media Partners, Wolkoff oversaw Trump’s sprawling week-long inaugural festivities&#8212;she sourced and managed third-party vendors, entertainers, and broadcasters, and oversaw the themes and production of all the concerts, dinners, balls, and programming. She worked in close proximity to the Trump family and inaugural chair <strong>Tom Barrack,</strong> a billionaire private-equity real-estate investor who had been a close friend of the president for years. And yet a year after the swearing-in ceremony, Wolkoff left the White House amid an uncomfortable public-relations crisis regarding the president’s inaugural committee.</p>\n<p>Last February, <em>The New York Times</em> published an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/politics/trumps-inaugural-committee-paid-26-million-to-first-ladys-friend.html\">article</a> centered on WIS, headlined “Trump’s Inaugural Committee Paid $26 million to Firm of First Lady’s Adviser.” The inaugural committee had raised a stunning $107 million&#8212;about twice what <strong>Barack Obama</strong> had hauled in 2009&#8212;from donors such as <strong>Sheldon Adelson</strong> and corporations like AT&amp;T. But as the <em>Times</em> reported, the tax form revealed profligate spending&#8212;nearly $10 million on travel; $4.6 million on salaries and benefits; and $100,000 to <strong>Rick Gates,</strong> the former campaign aide and deputy chairman of the inauguration who, about a week later, became one of <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> first major cooperating witnesses. Some $40 million was publicly unaccounted for. Wolkoff, as the event planner in charge, became the face of the disarray. The <em>Times</em> story quoted an official from a government watchdog group accusing the inaugural committee of “fiscal mismanagement at its worst.”</p>\n<p>Privately, Wolkoff refuted the characterization. According to bank statements, checks, and internal documents that I’ve reviewed, the $26 million in payment to WIS was largely distributed to third-party vendors and labor. Nearly $24 million was paid for projects related to the work of a subcontractor, Inaugural Productions, an independent organization run by individuals formerly associated with television producer <strong>Mark Burnett,</strong> which was responsible for staging several events. Around $1.6 million was used to compensate 15 contract workers who worked with Wolkoff as staffers. Wolkoff herself received $500,000 for her work on the inauguration. She had submitted audited records to the inauguration committee in March 2017, a month after she signed a gratuitous-services contract to work as an unpaid strategist and senior adviser to the First Lady.</p>\n<p>After the <em>Times</em> article, given her established documentation, Wolkoff urged Melania to defend her. But the administration demurred. <strong>Stephanie Grisham,</strong> the First Lady’s spokesperson, wrote in an e-mail, “This messaging is the best way to go in order to minimize the negative press stories of today and protect FLOTUS &amp; this administration.” A week later, Wolkoff left the East Wing after the White House instilled new security protocols in the wake of the <strong>Rob Porter</strong> scandal. A member of the White House Counsel’s Office called her on February 20, 2018, to let her know that the White House would be terminating all gratuitous-services agreements, including hers. It had nothing to do with her work on the inauguration, this person told her. “I am sorry that the professional part of our relationship has come to an end, but I am comforted in the fact that our [friendship] far outweigh[s] politics,” Melania wrote her in an e-mail later that day. “Thank you Again! Much love.”</p>\n<p>Later that evening, in a phone call, Wolkoff told the First Lady that she worried it appeared as if she had been fired on account of her work on the inauguration. The First Lady urged her not to be “dramatic.” Less than a week later, however, the <em>Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/melania-trump-inauguration-adviser.html\">published a story</a> stating that the severance of Wolkoff’s contract had been “prompted by displeasure from the Trumps” over the $26 million payment. Grisham told the <em>Times</em> that Melania “had no involvement” with the inaugural committee, and “had no knowledge of how funds were spent.” The president would create similar distance. <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> would later say, “The president was focused on the transition during that time, and not on any of the planning for the inauguration.” (A spokeswoman for the First Lady declined to comment for this story, as did the White House.)</p>\n<p>By the time Cohen and Wolkoff spoke last summer, she had returned to her life in New York. He would soon plead guilty to eight counts in a federal courthouse downtown. But Cohen let Wolkoff know that, among other documents and recordings, the F.B.I. had seized hours of their own conversations that he had taped. According to people familiar with the recordings, some of the taped conversations dealt directly with the inauguration. In them, Wolkoff detailed her own contemporaneous concerns with the inauguration&#8212;about how money was being spent, the general chaos of the process, and the involvement of Trump’s adult children. During these conversations, Wolkoff also raised her issues with the two men in charge of the committee: Gates and Barrack.</p>\n<p>These recordings, in part, led the Southern District of New York to launch a criminal investigation into how the inaugural committee spent its record $107 million. Now, the investigation appears to be advancing. In December, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-inauguration-spending-under-criminal-investigation-by-federal-prosecutors-11544736455\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/trump-inauguration-investigation.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported that prosecutors are examining the committee’s spending, and investigating whether foreign donors from nations including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates funneled money to the committee in an effort to influence U.S. policy. On Monday, the inaugural committee received a subpoena from the S.D.N.Y. requesting documents related to spending and donors, vendors, and benefits handed out, as well as documents related to a wealthy donor who had once registered as a foreign agent working on behalf of the Sri Lankan government. The <em>Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-inauguration-spending-under-criminal-investigation-by-federal-prosecutors-11544736455\">reported</a> that prosecutors have asked Gates about the inaugural fund’s spending and its donors. (<strong>Lorin Reisner</strong>, an attorney for Wolkoff, said in a statement: “Stephanie is not going to comment on these reports. She remains proud of her work on the inauguration, and we are confident that her conduct was proper in all respects.” Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>The subpoena is the latest sign that, while the Mueller investigation could be winding down, the Southern District may be probing a variety of Trump-adjacent avenues into the foreseeable future. An inquiry into the inauguration might also be acutely poignant, given Trump’s concurrent association with both his business and his incoming administration in its earliest days. It involved big money and outside influence. And it involved the Trump family in intimate, important ways. Wolkoff, suddenly and unexpectedly, could find herself in the middle of the maelstrom.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Wolkoff had made a career in the events business, but she knew from the outset the inauguration would be a unique, and uniquely Trumpian, experience. First, she was a political novice who knew little about what an inauguration entailed. Then, there was Trump’s controversial reputation. Upon accepting the post on the Friday after his election, Wolkoff quickly reached out to her network of vendors. Most of them, according to people familiar with these conversations, resisted the opportunity to work with Trump. Even Burnett, who Trump enlisted to conjure up reality-show-like gimmicks (such as flying a gaggle of drones over the crowd), wanted to keep his involvement private. (Burnett did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>Moreover, and perhaps not surprisingly, Trump’s family wanted to be involved in certain aspects of the coordination. Part of this, of course, was because they were going to be included in many of the events and, logistically, they had to know where to be and what to wear. It was also because Trump’s adult children have always been involved in affairs pertaining to their father, from his businesses to <em>The Apprentice</em> to his campaign. Each week, Wolkoff met with senior inaugural-committee members to present itemized, detailed updates on the status of her planning and financial reports from each vendor and for each event. She was also making regular presentations to Trump, Melania, and the Trump family about various decisions, so that they could weigh in. (White House spokespeople have previously denied that the Trumps were involved in any planning, and said they knew little about the events.) Trump and <strong>Ivanka</strong> were briefed on Burnett’s drone idea, for instance, after they had met with singer <strong>Andrea Bocelli</strong> in his office in Trump Tower about the possibility of him singing at an event. (The Italian tenor did not end up performing.)</p>\n<p>Trump was focused on the big-picture theatrics. He wanted to arrive on the Mall in a military plane with a military escort, much as he had arrived for tapings of <em>The Apprentice</em> on Trump Organization helicopters. He also wanted to have a full military parade, as well as tanks and helicopters on the ground. Ivanka, meanwhile, had more particular interests, according to e-mail and text exchanges and people familiar with the conversations. Originally, Ivanka wanted to host an event for women on the Wednesday before her father’s swearing-in ceremony. (The plan was ultimately scrapped.) To be helpful, she suggested a photographer who had once shot her for <em>Town &amp; Country</em> as someone who could take the official family portrait. She also offered a D.J. friend of hers from New York as a possible performer. She texted photos of the Obama family standing onstage together, with <strong>Sasha</strong> and <strong>Malia</strong> prominently situated in the middle of the frame. “FYI regarding the swearing in, it is nice to have family with him for this special moment,” she wrote.</p>\n<p>In large part, Wolkoff worried about potential ethical issues surrounding the First Family-elect and their businesses. After all, Gates had been staying in a suite at the Trump Hotel for most of the inaugural planning. More than a dozen inaugural staffers had also been staying there. The <em>Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/trump-inauguration-spending.html\">reported</a> last month that WIS alone had charged $31,000 for hotel rooms in the span of less than two months, including almost $18,000 at the Trump International Hotel. That did not include what was charged for room service, meals, and travel. In all, the Trump International Hotel was paid more than $1.5 million in inaugural funds, according to the <em>Times.</em> (Wolkoff’s contract states that the inaugural committee would reimburse WIS for travel, long-distance phone calls, mail-delivery services, and expenses connected to the performance of its work. WIS stands for “Who Is She,” Wolkoff’s play on her own anonymity.)</p>\n<p>During the course of planning, Wolkoff had corresponded with Ivanka about the cost of using the Trump Hotel for events leading up to the swearing-in ceremony. On December 10, 2016, a Trump Organization employee sent an estimate for a ballroom rental and food and beverage minimum to use the Trump Hotel space for eight days. The price she quoted was $3.6 million, according to an e-mail. A week later, Gates e-mailed Ivanka about the cost. In this exchange, first <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-trumps-inauguration-paid-trumps-company-with-ivanka-in-the-middle\">published</a> this past December by ProPublica and WNYC, Wolkoff flagged her concern. “These events are in PE’s [the president-elect’s] honor at his hotel and one of them is for family and close friends. Please take into consideration that when this is audited it will become public knowledge,” she wrote. (<strong>Peter Mirijanian,</strong> a spokesperson for Ivanka’s counsel <strong>Abbe Lowell,</strong> said in a statement: “When contacted by someone working on the inauguration, Ms. Trump passed the inquiry on to a hotel official and said only that any resulting discussions should be at a ‘fair market rate.’ Ms. Trump was not involved in any additional discussions.”)</p>\n<p>For an event producer used to detailed lists and punctilious itemization, Wolkoff was often caught off guard by the ad-hoc nature of the committee. According to the two people familiar with the matter, Gates approached a couple individuals working on the inauguration and asked if they would be willing to be paid directly for their work by a donor, rather than by the inaugural committee. They had received more donations than they’d initially anticipated, Gates told these people. Skirting the usual payment route could allow the inaugural committee to avoid reporting the full amount raised from donors. (A lawyer for Gates did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>Wolkoff frequently told Melania about her concerns regarding Gates, these people said. She relayed her concern about the high access level of his security pass within Trump Tower and his closeness with the Trump family. In her view, these people said, he exacerbated a situation already fraught with potential conflicts of interest. Members of the inaugural committee talked about how he frequently worked out of <strong>Donald Trump Jr.’s</strong> office. He was in constant communication with the adult children in order to keep them in the loop about decisions surrounding the inauguration.</p>\n<p>Wolkoff also questioned Gates and Barrack about pricing and budgets across the board, according to the people familiar with the conversations. She started to grow concerned about being left out of meetings, particularly as she raised more red flags. Because part of her responsibilities included reviewing all budgets from her vendors and presenting them to other members of the inaugural committee, she studied the line items in order to be able to explain them. At points, she could not justify the numbers coming in. After circulation of a quote from one of their largest event-production vendors, Hargrove LLC, Wolkoff was shocked that no one in the organization appeared willing to question the figures. She suggested that the quote seemed far beyond what the Obama inaugural committee would have been charged in 2009. She sent an e-mail to her team and Barrack on December 31, 2016. “I am DISGUSTED by [Hargrove’s] lack of transparency and entitlement to [the Presidential Inaugural Committee’s] funding,” she wrote. “I can not approve any budget line items because I do not have a clue what these numbers represent!!” (Hargrove did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>One of the most concerning aspects to Wolkoff’s team, according to the people familiar with the situation, was the amount of money and attention being spent on Barrack’s chairman dinner, which he hosted on an evening before the swearing-in. A draft guest list for the event from days before the dinner included the likes of retired Lieutenant General <strong>Mike Flynn,</strong> G.O.P. fund-raiser <strong>Elliott Broidy,</strong> Michael Cohen, and key officials in the incoming administration. Among the list marked as confirmed were seven people described as “foreign ministers” for Saudi Arabia, one foreign minister from Qatar, and one from the United Arab Emirates. They were the only people on the list who were unnamed. (On Tuesday, ProPublica <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-tom-barrack-colony-company-of-trump-inaugural-chair-sought-to-profit\">published</a> a memo that showed Barrack’s investment firm planned to profit from its connections to the Trump administration. A spokesperson called it “an outline of a proposed potential business plan which was never acted upon or implemented.”)</p>\n<p>A spokesman for Barrack declined to comment, but pointed me toward comments Barrack made in a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chairmans-global-dinner-most-exclusive-event-preceding-trump-inauguration-1484571781\"><em>Journal</em> report</a> published days before the inauguration. “The evening is intended to be the president-elect’s first fingerprint on the global canvas of social democracy and outreach,” Barrack said at the time, explaining that the evening was set up to reach out to local international diplomats and create a “hopeful tapestry of international cooperation and respect.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Much has been made of the various problems with the inauguration, from the lackluster crowd size to the president’s own “American carnage” speech, which struck a tone so dark that <strong>George W. Bush</strong> was reportedly heard calling it “some weird shit.” But Wolkoff’s part, the event itself, went off without a hitch, and the family was pleased. The day after the swearing-in ceremony was Wolkoff’s birthday. The Trumps sent flowers to the Trump Hotel room where she had been staying. She flew back to New York on a military plane with Melania, her stylist, hairdresser, makeup artist, and the rest of the Trump family, apart from the president, Ivanka, and <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> who remained in Washington.</p>\n<p>Much is still unknown about how inaugural funds were managed, or if the unaccounted for $40-odd million will ever be publicly explained. It’s unclear whether there was foreign influence, or illicit attempts to profit off of proceedings. What Gates has offered investigators&#8212;about anything, really, but about the inauguration, in particular&#8212;is also unclear. How deep the Southern District’s investigation into all of this is yet unknown. But much like some of Cohen’s other taped conversations, the discussions with Wolkoff about the inauguration may have turned out to be consequential. On the witness stand during <strong>Paul Manafort’s</strong> trial in Virginia last summer, prosecutors asked Gates if he charged personal expenses to the committee. “It’s possible,” he responded.</p>\n<p>As investigators continue to pursue the matter, they may find themselves in a familiar situation: seeking out former Trump allies-turned-adversaries who saw it all go down firsthand. One of the most inexplicable plot points in the whirling Trump drama has been the president’s public treatment of his former lawyer. Trump was aware that Cohen possessed all manner of damaging information about him, and yet he wasted few opportunities to disparage him publicly. Ultimately, Cohen implicated Trump in federal campaign-finance violations as he pleaded guilty. He spent more than 70 hours cooperating with federal investigators, opening his book to tell them what he knew about the president, his business, and the campaign. While Wolkoff’s treatment has been gentler, she’s been similarly isolated and publicly disparaged. And now, what she knows could be of interest to investigators, too.</p>\n<p><em>This story has been updated to reflect Mark Burnett&#39;s connection to Inaugural Productions.</em></p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Trump’s World","socialTitle":"“I Am Disgusted”: Behind the Scenes of Trump’s $107 Million Inauguration","socialDescription":"Stephanie Winston Wolkoff was the mastermind event producer behind Trump’s inaugural celebration, which has since come under S.D.N.Y. investigation.

let go of his longtime rivalry with <em>S.N.L.,</em> squeezing in a ding at the “Democrat spin machine” here, a defense of <strong>Kanye West</strong> there, but largely ignoring its jabs. That appeared to change Sunday morning, as Trump resumed his full-throated attacks after a particularly scathing series of sketches. “Nothing funny about tired <em>Saturday Night Live</em> on Fake News NBC!” he tweeted.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The president presumably caught wind of Saturday’s cold open, which featured <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> reprising his long-standing impression to mock the president’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-national-emergency-declaration-wall\">declaration</a> of a national emergency on Friday. Trump and his ilk have famously bristled at the impression, and didn’t take kindly to <em>Saturday Night Live</em> recounting&#8212;arguably without parody&#8212;the controversial press conference.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block video row\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8vQlhWBvAwY\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"> </iframe></div></div><p>“Wall works, wall makes safe. You don’t have to be smart to understand that&#8212;in fact, it’s even easier to understand if you’re not that smart,” he said, increasingly stunting his grammar. “You can all see why I gotta fake this national emergency, right? I have to because I want to. It’s really simple. We have a problem. Drugs are coming into this country through no wall.”</p>\n<p>The impression also took aim at Trump’s own sing-song recital of the challenges his declaration will face in court.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ll immediately be sued, and the ruling will not go in my favor and then\nend up in the Supreme Court, and then I’ll call my buddy Kavanaugh\nand I’ll say, ‘It’s time to repay the Donny,’ and he’ll say, ‘New phone, who dis?’\nAnd by then the Mueller report will be released, crumbling my house of cards,\nand I can just plead insanity and do a few months in the puzzle factory and my\npersonal hell of playing president will finally be over.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the real Trump threatening “retribution” for NBC’s “Republican hit jobs,” the president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097117499336855553\">reiterated his talking point</a> that “THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!” Trump had kept largely silent on the topic of <em>S.N.L.</em> in recent months, only piping up when supporter Kanye West controversially <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/kanye-west-trump-rant-video-saturday-night-live-snl-chris-rock-instagram\">donned a “Make America Great Again” hat</a> in a September outro:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1046443996074127361\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1046443996074127361\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1046443996074127361</a></p></blockquote></div><p>He also raged against the network in December, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1074302851906707457\">tweeting</a>, “A REAL scandal is the one sided coverage, hour by hour, of networks like NBC &amp; Democrat spin machines like <em>Saturday Night Live.</em> It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials.

Mick Mulvaney, chafing at the family, is eyeing the exits, as is Larry Kudlow.","body":"<p>After the pummeling he incurred during the 35-day shutdown&#8212;a self-inflicted punishment&#8212;<strong>Donald Trump</strong> was looking forward to his State of the Union address, seeing it as a presidential safe space where at least some of the attendees <em>had</em> to applaud for him. “He was in a great mood and really seemed ready to go,” a Republican who spoke with Trump before the speech told me. The generally positive response from his favored outlets&#8212;Drudge’s headline blared “Trump Rocks House”&#8212;has pleased the president this week, sources said. “He’s been in a good mood,” another prominent Republican said. And the no-socialism themes were seen as a potent weapon against Democrats in 2020&#8212;the first hopeful sign in a while.</p>\n<p>But while the State of the Union adjusted the president’s mood, it wasn’t enough to re-align the underlying dysfunction of the West Wing. Morale inside the White House, never high to begin with, has turned particularly bleak, according to interviews with 10 former West Wing officials and Republicans close to the president. The issue is that many see Trump himself as the problem. “Trump is hated by everyone inside the White House,” a former West Wing official told me. His shambolic management style, paranoia, and pattern of blaming staff for problems of his own making have left senior White House officials burned out and resentful, sources said. “It’s total misery. People feel trapped,” a former official said. “Trump always needs someone to blame,” a second former official said. Sources said the leak of Trump’s private schedules to Axios&#8212;which revealed how little work Trump actually does&#8212;was a signal of how disaffected his staff has become.</p>\n<p>White House Communications Director <strong>Bill Shine</strong> has told friends he’s angry that Trump has singled him out for the bad press during the government shutdown. “Bill is like, ‘you’re the guy who steps on the message more than anyone,’” said a Republican who’s spoken with Shine recently. Economic adviser <strong>Larry Kudlow</strong> has told people he’s probably got six months left. “Larry’s really tired of it all,” a source close to Kudlow said.</p>\n<p>What’s driving a lot of the frustration is that Trump, now more than ever, runs the West Wing as a family business. Four sources said the only White House advisers he truly consults are daughter <strong>Ivanka</strong> and son-in-law <strong>Jared Kushner.</strong> “This is a family affair, and if you’re not in the family, you’ve got problems,” a former official said. The special privileges and access afforded to Kushner and Ivanka have been alienating Trump’s acting chief of staff, <strong>Mick Mulvaney.</strong> “Mick is not entirely thrilled with the family,” a Republican close to Mulvaney told me. Multiple sources said Mulvaney is looking for a way out of the West Wing. He’s said to be interested in a Cabinet position, either at the Commerce Department or Treasury, and he’s reportedly been pursuing the University of South Carolina presidency. A senior White House official recently lobbied a friend of Mulvaney’s to convince Mulvaney to stay.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Mulvaney is working to stave off another political crisis before Trump either shuts the government down again or declares a state of emergency to fund his southern border wall. One source briefed on the internal debate said that Mulvaney is advising Trump to accept less than his demand of $5 billion and make up the difference by shuffling money around the existing budget. “Mick wants to re-program existing funds,” the source said. Trump has insisted he won’t compromise, but he faces no good options, with a G.O.P. revolt likely if he goes the national-emergency route. “Trump is going to declare whatever happens a victory,” a former West Wing official said.</p>\n<p>The White House declined to comment.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Capitol Hill","socialTitle":"“Trump Is Hated by Everyone”: Trump’s SOTU Euphoria Masks West Wing Misery","socialDescription":"The leak of his schedules is a sign of deep disaffection.

But when it comes to the federal contractors who also went unpaid during that period&#8212;up to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/13/18223471/back-pay-federal-contractors-shutdown\">580,000 people</a>, according to one estimate&#8212;it gets trickier. “I’ve been told the president won’t sign” anything that guarantees them back pay, Senator <strong>Roy Blunt</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-blocking-contractor-back-pay-gov-t-funding-deal-lawmaker-n971226\">told reporters</a> on Wednesday. “I guess federal contractors are different in his view than federal employees.”</p>\n<p>On the 2016 campaign trail, it was a well-known (but ultimately overlooked) fact that Trump <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-business-plan-left-a-trail-of-unpaid-bills-1465504454\">routinely refused to pay contractors</a> during his career as a businessman. But the idea of paying these contractors reportedly had bipartisan support, until <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> shot it down. A legislative source <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/429827-push-to-include-contractor-back-pay-in-funding-deal-hits-gop-roadblock\">told</a> the Hill that the administrative cost alone to pay back the contractors would be as high as the back pay itself, and that previous shutdown negotiations did not include this provision. “That was not initially part of our deal,” Senator <strong>Richard Shelby</strong> explained. “I personally would rather keep it narrow in scope.”</p>\n<p>Other Republicans, such as <strong>John Cornyn,</strong> seemed to take joy in turning contractor pain to political gain. “<strong>[Nancy] Pelosi</strong> and <strong>[Chuck] Schumer</strong> should have thought about this and other collateral damage when they initially refused to negotiate on border security, something they are apparently now willing to do,” he told NBC News. “Thousands of federal contractors have not been reimbursed from the 35-day shutdown,” Schumer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1095770911196831744\">said</a> in response to these reports. “This issue is hanging in the balance. . . .

of Trump’s infamous hue?","body":"<p>Long before <strong>President Trump</strong> decried investigations of his office over Twitter, a gentler query dogged the celebrity businessman: how does he maintain his infamous orange hue, even while residing in wintry D.C.? It’s a question that persists into the third year of Trump’s tenure in the White House, and investigations of the matter have yielded surprising insight into the commander in chief’s styling habits.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/us/politics/trump-tan.html\">The New York Times</a></em> pursued the idea as a matter of Trump’s health, though a senior administration official only offered that Trump’s notable tan&#8212;in February, no less&#8212;is the result of “good genes.” Further investigation revealed that neither tanning beds nor spray-tan booths exist within the White House or Air Force One, at least according to senior officials. Former aide <strong>Omarosa Manigault Newman</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/death-spiral-why-omarosa-totally-triggered-trump\">wrote in a tell-all book</a> that Trump travels with a tanning bed, while lighter-hued circles around the president’s eyes have fueled speculation that he utilizes goggles to protect himself from ultraviolet rays.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, neither bronzer nor tanning cream has been observed among Trump’s bathroom grooming products, at least when the president has offered a tour of the facilities to supporters. Trump, who suffers from rosacea, is reported to apply his own translucent makeup powder before television appearances, and has even adjusted the lighting at White House events to avoid appearing too orange on-screen. When possible, he prefers the natural light of the White House Rose Garden.</p>\n<p>Trump’s orange hue has also proven a frequent source of media ridicule, even as <em>Saturday Night Live</em> star <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> has suggested makeup artists deliberately avoid exaggerating the shade&#8212;at <strong>Lorne Michaels’s</strong> behest&#8212;so as “not to over-orange anything out of malice.” Baldwin has otherwise described Trump’s look as somewhere between “Mark Rothko orange” and a “slightly paler Orange Crush.”</p>\n<p>The president is famously self-sufficient when it comes to appearance, even detailing the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/photos/2015/09/an-illustrated-history-of-donald-trumps-hair\">elaborate process</a> behind his signature swooping blond hair. And while an unnamed former campaign hand admitted Trump’s orange glow is “a captivating story,” they insisted Trump’s grooming habits are his own secret to keep.</p>","rubric":"45

So, really, it was only a matter of time before <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-31/trump-is-said-to-consider-herman-cain-for-federal-reserve-board?srnd=premium\">this happened</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Herman Cain,</strong> the former pizza company executive who ran for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, is being considered by President Donald Trump for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since 2012 was approximately 87 lifetimes ago in Trump years, you may need a refresher on Cain. The following is a list of his career highlights that presumably convinced Trump he should be given a job guiding the U.S.’s monetary policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>9-9-9:</strong> While running for president, Cain famously introduced a tax proposal called the 9-9-9 plan, which would have eliminated the tax system entirely and <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/sep/26/facts-about-herman-cains-9-9-9-tax-plan/\">replaced</a> it with a 9 percent personal income tax, a 9 percent corporate income tax, and a 9 percent national sales tax. Economists <a href=\"http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/9-9-9-the-most-massive-redistribution-of-taxes-ever-seriously-considered/\">called</a> it “The most massively regressive redistribution of taxes ever seriously considered” and <a href=\"https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/15/cain-unable/\">warned</a> that it would be “a huge tax increase on most Americans, but a huge tax cut on the wealthy.” (<strong>Paul Ryan</strong> and <strong>Larry Kudlow</strong> were, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/larry-kudlow-wants-trump-to-cut-taxes-again\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/paul-ryan-retirement-speech\">course</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/paul-ryan-loves-herman-cains-9-9-9-tax-plan-2011-10\">big</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/id/44909981\">fans</a>.) Cain <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2011/11/9-9-9-the-movie-069181#ixzz1h8QZfplI\">produced</a> a six-minute video called <em>9-9-9 the Movie: Slaying the Tax Monster,</em> but was apparently less receptive to IRL inquiries:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/morningmoneyben/status/1091020873350430720\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/morningmoneyben/status/1091020873350430720\">https://twitter.com/morningmoneyben/status/1091020873350430720</a></p></blockquote></div><ul>\n<li><strong>Uzbekistan:</strong> There is no question in our minds that Trump <em>loved</em> <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/herman-cain-i-dont-know-the-president-of-ubeki-beki-beki-stan-stan-a0ebdaf0014e/\">this 2011 exchange</a> between Cain and conservative reporter <strong>David Brody:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Brody: Are you ready for the ‘gotcha’ questions that are coming from the media and others on foreign policy? Like, who’s the president of Uzbekistan?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cain: I’m ready for the ‘gotcha’ questions and they’re already starting to come. And when they ask me who is the president of Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan I’m going to say, you know, I don’t know. Do you know?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-<strong>Gold:</strong> As of his presidential run, Cain <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/05/herman-cain-federal-reserve-chairman-tea-party-champion/239519/\">favored</a> a return to the gold standard, and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304070304577395891113592150\">wrote</a> in an op-ed for <em>The Wall Street Journal:</em> “A gold standard is to the moochers and looters in government what sunlight and garlic are to vampires.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pizza:</strong> Cain was the chief executive officer of Godfather’s Pizza. Trump obviously believes this makes Cain more qualified for the job than some loser PhD.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>-<strong>Sexual harassment:</strong> During Cain’s run for office, Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2011/10/exclusive-2-women-accused-cain-of-inappropriate-behavior-067194\">reported</a> that at least two female employees at the National Restaurant Association received financial settlements after making sexual harassment claims against Cain when he served as the group’s president. Cain vacillated between saying he was “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/01/herman-cain-settlement-sexual-harassment\">unaware of any sort of settlement</a>,” to admitting that they happened and he knew about them, to calling the whole thing a “witch hunt,” a line that undoubtedly scored him points with the Big Guy, who has been <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/women-accused-trump-sexual-misconduct-list-2017-12\">accused</a> of sexual misconduct by 22 separate women and has made “witch hunt” his <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/witches-to-trump-stop-calling-the-mueller-investigation-a-witch-hunt\">catchphrase</a> of choice.</p>\n<p>Shockingly for this administration, Cain <em>does</em> have some relevant work experience, having served as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City from 1992 to 1996, though, as <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/31/trump-considers-former-gop-presidential-candidate-herman-cain-federal-reserve/?utm_term=.0a2473cba88d\">notes</a>, “those posts are often given to business executives and community leaders who serve to inform top Fed officials about what they are seeing in the labor market and economy more broadly.” Or, as Dartmouth College economics professor <strong>Danny Blanchflower,</strong> who previously sat on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, put it:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/D_Blanchflower/status/1091015619061919745\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/D_Blanchflower/status/1091015619061919745\">https://twitter.com/D_Blanchflower/status/1091015619061919745</a></p></blockquote></div><p>One potential factor that <em>could</em> derail Cain’s candidacy? When he served on the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, he was known as an inflation hawk, which is the exact opposite of what Trump wants from the Fed, as exemplified by the fact that his handpicked Fed chair, <strong>Jerome Powell,</strong> is <em>this close</em> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/trump-spends-christmas-eve-trashing-the-federal-reserve\">to waking up with a horse’s head in his bed</a>. Still, it’s entirely possible, as <em>New York</em>’s <strong>Josh Barro</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbarro/status/1091013868715995137\">points out</a>, that “Trump assumes Cain has no fixed ideology and would do whatever he wants.” Anyway, if this Cain thing doesn’t work out, <strong>Jose Canseco</strong> is presumably <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/12/jose-canseco-wants-to-run-the-federal-reserve\">still interested in the gig</a>!</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Bernie Sanders not about to sit back and let Elizabeth Warren have all the fun</strong></p>\n<p>You want a “soak the rich”&#8211;style tax proposal? <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/01/31/bernie-sanders-propose-dramatic-expansion-estate-tax-richest-americans-including-percent-rate-billionaires/\">You got it</a>!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will unveil a plan Thursday to dramatically expand the federal estate tax on the wealthy, including a new 77 percent rate on billionaires&#39; estates, as leading Democratic politicians push new taxes on the richest Americans to combat inequality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sanders’s bill, the “For the 99.8% Act,” would tax the estates of the 0.2 percent of Americans who inherit more than $3.5 million, while the rest of the country “would not see their taxes go up by one penny under this plan,” according to aides to the Vermont senator, who is considering a 2020 presidential bid. . . . Sanders’s plan would restore the 77 percent top estate tax rate that was in place in the U.S. from 1941 to 1976, tax estates worth more than $3.5 million, and create several new estate tax brackets, including a 55 percent rate on estates worth more than $50 million.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Our bill does what the American people want us to be doing and that is to demand that the very wealthiest families in this country start paying their fair share of taxes,” Sanders <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/01/31/bernie-sanders-propose-dramatic-expansion-estate-tax-richest-americans-including-percent-rate-billionaires/?utm_term=.2268c54a4430\">said</a> in a press release. Of the decision by three top Republican senators this week to release a plan that would expunge the estate tax&#8212;already weakened from last year’s legislation&#8212;Sanders commented: “It is literally beyond belief that the Republican leadership wants to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top 0.2 percent of our population. . . . This is not only insane, it tells us the degree to which the billionaire class controls the Republican Party.”</p>\n<p><strong>Democrats are coming for Trump’s tax returns</strong></p>\n<p>Cue cries of “WITCH HUNT!” in <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/31/house-democrats-take-first-step-to-go-after-trumps-tax-returns.html\">3 . . . 2 . . .</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A House committee will hold a hearing next week on presidential tax returns as Democrats clamor for access to President Donald Trump’s elusive financial information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rep. <strong>John Lewis,</strong> a Georgia Democrat and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee’s Oversight Subcommittee, announced the event will take place on Feb. 7. The hearing in front of the Democratic-led panel is called “Legislative Proposals and Tax Law Related to Presidential and Vice-Presidential Tax Returns.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It marks the new Democratic House majority’s first formal step on the path to focusing on Trump’s tax returns. The president refused to release the documents during the 2016 campaign, in a break with decades of precedent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“This is the beginning of a court case,” Ways and Means Committee Chairman <strong>Richard Neal</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/29/politics/trump-tax-returns/index.html\">told</a> CNN. “I think the idea here is to avoid the emotion of the moment and make sure that the product stands up under critical analysis. And it will.”</p>\n<p><strong>Of course the White House used the shutdown to chip away at workers’ rights</strong></p>\n<p>With everyone focused on the wall, the Trump administration decided it was a great time to relieve employers of the burden of reporting workplace injuries to the Department of Labor, as part of the presidency’s ongoing attempt to return to the good old days when business owners didn’t have to comply with health and safety laws that obviously serve no other purpose than to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/29/18197346/trump-labor-electronic-injury-reporting-rule\">eat into their profits</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The partial government shutdown may have disrupted air travel and triggered financial hardship, but it didn’t stop the White House from continuing to dismantle regulations meant to protect U.S. workers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On Friday, the Trump administration gutted a 2016 rule that required most employers to electronically submit detailed reports of all workplace injuries to the Department of Labor each year&#8212;reports they’ve long been required to keep, but never required to submit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses rule would have allowed the government, for the first time, to get more complete data on how many U.S. workers are injured on the job and how those injuries happened. Enacted under the Obama administration, it was supposed to help inspectors identify dangerous work conditions, and in turn pressure businesses to comply with workplace safety laws.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Vox, the Office of Management and Budget “rushed the amendment through the three-month review process in just six weeks&#8212;even though the office was closed during the shutdown and two-thirds of the office’s employees were furloughed,” with the changes finalized on and published by Friday.</p>\n<p><strong>Hedge-fund C.E.O. thinks policy of ripping colleagues to shreds is actually really nice</strong></p>\n<p>“It’s kind of a family atmosphere,” Bridgewater Associates co-C.E.O. <strong>Eileen Murray</strong> <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/eileen-murray-bridgewater-associates-co-ceo-hails-hedge-funds-culture-51548870197\">said</a> of the firm’s unorthodox culture wherein employees must earn “<a href=\"https://inside.bwater.com/publications/principles_excerpt\">the right to have an opinion</a>,” are fired <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/what-in-gods-name-is-happening-at-the-worlds-largest-hedge-fund\">in firm-wide e-mails</a>, and are taken to task by the group in meetings called “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/business/dealbook/bridgewaters-ray-dalio-spreads-his-gospel-of-radical-transparency.html\">public hangings</a>.” She added: “I don’t know about you, but for me, my family tells me things I don’t want to hear. But they do it out of a sense of love and kindness . . . Some people think [the culture] sounds harsh and stressful. I think it’s very kind.”</p>\n<p><strong>Area man is very smart, very knowledgable about how stock market works</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed

Let Koch’s expert on water and chemical regulations decide.","body":"<p>Of all the federal agencies that fall under <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> purview, none embodies the administration’s unofficial mandate to do the exact opposite of its stated mission quite like the Environmental Protection Agency. For the last two years, the E.P.A.&#8212;which, as a reminder, is supposed to be protecting human health and the environment&#8212;has done everything in its power to turn the planet into an ashtray and convince Americans that toxic chemicals are actually totally fine to drink, breathe, and otherwise ingest, all in an effort to help companies secreting those chemicals maximize their profits. Which is to say, we probably should have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/04/former-koch-official-runs-epa-chemical-research-1136230\">seen this one coming</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Trump administration has placed a former Koch Industries official in charge of research that will shape how the government regulates a class of toxic chemicals contaminating millions of Americans’ drinking water&#8212;an issue that could have major financial repercussions for his former employer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Dunlap,</strong> a deputy in E.P.A.’s Office of Research and Development, is playing a key role as the agency decides how to protect people from the pollution left behind at hundreds of military bases and factories across the country. . .He spent the previous eight years as Koch Industries’ lead expert on water and chemical regulations, a position that typically includes helping companies to limit regulatory restrictions and liability for cleanups.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dunlap was hired in October, according to previously undisclosed documents. Since then, he has been extremely busy, having reportedly been involved in high-level meetings that preceded the agency’s decision <em>not</em> to set drinking water limits for chemicals known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which “have been linked with kidney and testicular cancer, as well as other ailments.” (In a statement, <strong>David Ross</strong>, EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Water, told the Hive: “Despite what is being reported, EPA has not finalized or publicly issued its PFAS management plan, and any information that speculates what is included in the plan is premature. The agency is committed to following the Safe Drinking Water Act process for evaluating new drinking water standards, which is just one of the many components of the draft plan that is currently undergoing interagency review.”) According to Politico, Dunlap has been able to avoid a Senate confirmation hearing in which his prior work experience might come up because Trump has not officially nominated anyone to run to office. (Dunlap’s <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/research/david-dunlap\">official bio</a> on the E.P.A. Web site declines to mention any of his employers during his “more than 30 years” working for “private industry, trade associations and as an environmental consultant.”) Currently, Koch subsidiary Georgia-Pacific, a paper and pulp conglomerate, is facing at least one class-action suit related to chemicals now under Dunlap’s purview.</p>\n<p>Koch’s various environmental crimes against humanity are laid out in several high-profile lawsuits over the past 20 years. According to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111005022145/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-02/koch-brothers-flout-law-getting-richer-with-secret-iran-sales.html\">Bloomberg</a>, “Koch Industries was assessed more than $400 million in fines, penalties, and judgments” between 1999 and 2003, such as for dumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of aviation fuel into a Minnesota wetland. “You want an independent, hardheaded scientific review of these issues; you don’t want somebody who is already taking the industry party line,” <strong>Erik Olson,</strong> who heads up the Natural Resources Defense Council’s public health work, told Politico. “There’s a legitimate threat there and, from my perspective, the conflicts of interest that [Dunlap] has having worked as a regulatory compliance director at Georgia-Pacific raises questions about whether he can make those objective decisions or should be recused.”</p>\n<p>Dunlap, of course, is unlikely to be replaced by someone without a host of conflicts of interest given that the guy currently running the E.P.A., <strong>Andrew Wheeler,</strong> is a walking, talking conflict of interest, having <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/07/06/626525274/get-to-know-andrew-wheeler-ex-coal-lobbyist-with-inside-track-to-lead-epa\">served as a coal-lobbyist</a> prior to taking over the top job from departed Grift King <strong>Scott Pruitt.</strong> It is, in other words, par for the course.

The World Bank board traditionally accepts the U.S. nominee for the position.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For those who need a reminder, previous candidates the First Daughter has backed for roles in the administration include <strong>Anthony</strong> “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/anthony-scaramucci-new-yorker\">My Colleague Auto-Fellates Himself</a>” <strong>Scaramucci</strong> and <strong>Hope</strong> “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-dictated-sons-misleading-statement-on-meeting-with-russian-lawyer/2017/07/31/04c94f96-73ae-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304_story.html\">Misleading Statements About Russia</a>” <strong>Hicks.</strong> But her most memorable recommendation would undoubtedly be unregistered foreign agent-turned-convicted criminal <strong>Mike Flynn,</strong> whose candidacy she <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-wanted-michael-flynn-white-house-729379\">wholeheartedly endorsed</a> during the transition, praising the retired general’s “amazing loyalty to my father,” after inviting the guy to a staffing meeting without telling then-transition coordinator <strong>Chris Christie.</strong> “General, what job do you want?” Ivanka <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/23/the-danger-of-president-pence\">reportedly</a> asked Flynn at the time. “It was like Princess Ivanka had laid the sword on Flynn’s shoulders and said, ‘Rise and go forth,’” a participant at the meeting told <em>The New Yorker.</em> In other words, congratulations on your nomination, <strong>Martin Shkreli.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ryan Zinke lands post-administration gig</strong></p>\n<p>The former Interior secretary, who is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-dept-investigating-whether-zinke-lied-to-inspector-general/2019/01/03/6c9dea06-0eac-11e9-84fc-d58c33d6c8c7_story.html\">currently being investigated</a> for possibly lying to his agency’s inspector-general investigators, has taken a job <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/425275-zinke-takes-job-at-investment-firm\">in the investment industry</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Artillery One, an investment firm that focuses on industries like energy and financial technology, said Monday that Zinke is its new managing director. . . . The company said Zinke’s agenda with Artillery One will include continuing “to follow the vision of President <strong>Donald J. Trump</strong> in making America great again, by bringing economic development, jobs, and opportunities for people, at home and internationally.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Under Trump’s ethics pledge for administration officials, Zinke is prohibited from lobbying on Interior issues for five years, though that <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-appointees-pledged-not-to-lobby-after-they-leave-now-lobbying\">hasn’t stopped his former colleagues from doing exactly that</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Anthony Scaramucci is coming to a small screen near you</strong></p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/14/anthony-scaramucci-big-brother-celebrity-edition\">sounds right</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not content with being evicted from one famous house after less than two weeks, Scaramucci has been announced as a contestant on the next series of <em>Celebrity Big Brother.</em> He will be joined by <strong>Lindsay Lohan’s</strong> mother; wrestler <strong>Eva Marie;</strong> and <strong>Kato Kaelin,</strong> whose fame is almost entirely derived from being a key witness in the <strong>O.J. Simpson</strong> trial, having stayed at Simpson’s home on the night of the murder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since leaving the Trump administration, Scaramucci&#8212;known generally, if largely unaffectionately, as the Mooch&#8212;has set up his own news site, the Scaramucci Post. Shortly after launch, the site made headlines for running a poll asking how many Jews died in the Holocaust.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to <em>The Guardian,</em> the Mooch refused to appear on <em>Big Brother</em> in 2017 when he was rumored to be shopping his own reality series, but reportedly changed his mind “after seeing the impact <strong>Omarosa Manigault Newman,</strong>” another former White House staffer, made on the show.</p>\n<p><strong>Janet Yellen just asking to wake up with a horse’s head in her bed</strong></p>\n<p>That, or an unhinged, grammatically questionable <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-14/yellen-warns-anecdotal-signs-show-businesses-pausing-spending\">attack on Twitter</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On paper, it still looks like a dynamite macro-economic environment in the U.S. But outside the numbers, some cracks are starting to emerge, said former Federal Reserve Chair <strong>Janet Yellen.</strong> “All the hard data that we have on economic activity suggests that things are in good shape,’’ Yellen said during an onstage interview at the National Retail Federation’s annual trade show in New York City.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But while 2018 was a good year, in 2019 “almost all economists are forecasting a slowdown,’’ she said. “The global economy was firing on all cylinders in 2018 and now looks like we’ve got less strong and less synchronized global growth.’’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“We’re hearing anecdotal reports’’ about “businesses beginning to put investment plans on hold because of the uncertainties they face in the global environment and around supply chains and trade,’’ Yellen <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-14/yellen-warns-anecdotal-signs-show-businesses-pausing-spending\">commented</a> Monday, just begging @realDonaldTrump to come after her.

Trump</strong> has jumped the gun. Last week, the Trump administration revealed plans to remove all American troops from Syria by the end of April&#8212;a position long championed by the president. The move rankled even some congressional allies like Senator <strong>Lindsey Graham,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">apparently</a> made his displeasure known to Acting Defense Secretary <strong>Patrick Shanahan</strong> over the weekend. Now, it’s clear lawmakers weren’t the only ones blindsided by the planned withdrawal&#8212;key United States allies appear to have been left out of the loop as well.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/allies-say-they-wont-remain-in-syria-after-us-troops-withdraw/2019/02/20/62e503b2-3532-11e9-a400-e481bf264fdc_story.html?utm_term=.9c6870c65501\">reported</a> that U.S. allies “unanimously” declined the Trump administration’s request to pick up the slack fighting ISIS in Syria if the U.S. removes its troops in the spring, as Trump has apparently directed Shanahan to do. A senior administration official told the <em>Post</em> that allies have made it clear they “won’t stay if you pull out.” Trump’s hasty move, then, could leave behind a powder keg. “It’s not safe to leave these enemies there, without any referee or mediating force,” said a U.S. official.</p>\n<p>His approach to Syria is the latest example of Trump’s seeming tendency to push policy without working out the details, which has frustrated even some of his closest allies. “That’s the dumbest fucking idea I’ve ever heard,” Graham evidently <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">told</a> Shanahan of Trump’s withdrawal plan in a meeting in Munich last Saturday. The South Carolina Republican, normally a staunch defender of the president, has been venting about the administration’s Syria policy since December, when Trump suddenly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/donald-trump-syria-troops\">announced</a> it would be up to other nations to fight ISIS there&#8212;despite also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1075397797929775105\">claiming</a> that the terrorist organization had been “defeated.” Graham torched the policy, saying at the time that he would “hold the administration accountable for this decision,” and threatened hearings over the planned move.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to imagine that any president would wake up and make this kind of decision with this little communication,” Republican Senator <strong>Bob Corker</strong> said at the time.</p>\n<p>But it appears that’s precisely how Trump has approached one of the most complicated foreign-policy conundrums of his presidency. While the commander-in-chief seemingly continues to talk out of his ass&#8212;on Friday, he said he would announce the “eradication of the caliphate . . . over the next 24 hours,” but no such announcement has come&#8212;U.S. allies appear to be losing patience. Last week, French Foreign Minister <strong>Jean-Yves Le Drian</strong> <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/u-s-pullout-from-syria-benefits-iran-says-french-fm-1.6938647\">called</a> Trump’s call for withdrawal a “mystery,” and British Foreign Secretary <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> has said that “there is no prospect of British forces replacing the Americans” in Syria. Their pushback has left Trump hanging. Whether it will be enough to force him to reconsider remains to be seen.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a

He often spends this time watching TV, tweeting, holding impromptu meetings and making phone calls, aides have said. Trump has played golf&#8212;the traditional kind, on an outdoor course&#8212;about 139 times as president, largely at his own golf clubs, according to an analysis by <em>The Washington Post.</em> There is no way to have an exact count because he usually does not acknowledge having played.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For those of you keeping track, an installation that took place “during the last few weeks” likely occurred at the tail end of the government shutdown, a period in which Trump reportedly <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-misses-mar-lago-stuck-white-house-shutdown-report-1292157\">complained</a> to friends about missing Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach resort and golf club of choice. Apparently, he got so wound up that he never again wanted to contemplate a situation in which he wouldn’t be able to stop whatever else he was doing during “executive time” to whack a few balls. (Thankfully, Trump broke his days-not-playing-golf streak on February 2, getting a round in with <strong>Tiger Woods</strong> and <strong>Jack Nicklaus</strong> at his course in Jupiter, Florida.)</p>\n<p>While Trump’s unparalleled laziness has been well-documented&#8212;we’ve known for some time now that the president <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/trump-schedule-executive-time\">rarely makes it out of the residence before 11 A.M., and punches out just after 4 P.M.</a>&#8212;people would probably care a lot less about his golf routine if he hadn’t spent eight years going after Obama (who also had an on-site simulator, though an “an older, less sophisticated” version) for the same nasty habit.

In fact, the whole thing felt so bizarre and over-the-top obsequious that A.M.I. apparently had some qualms of its own.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/national-enquirer-publisher-asked-justice-department-for-advice-on-saudi-connection-11549908996\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, the publisher “sought advice from the Justice Department” last year over whether its obvious propaganda would cross the line between substandard journalism and literally working as an agent of a foreign government. While A.M.I. claimed in the past that Saudi officials had no role in the magazine’s creation, in fact, the publisher gave an adviser to the Kingdom a draft of the magazine and followed the adviser’s editorial advice, per a letter to the D.O.J. However, because there was no official contract stating the company <em>had</em> to follow the adviser’s suggestions&#8212;because, in other words, A.M.I. did so simply out of its love for M.B.S., or as a person familiar with the matter put it, in an attempt to “kiss his ass”&#8212;the Justice Department ruled that the publisher was not required to register as a foreign agent, a conclusion it warned could change if the facts “are different in any way from those depicted in your submission.”</p>\n<p>Of course, last summer’s glossy isn’t the only time A.M.I. has crossed paths with the Kingdom, directly or indirectly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In recent years, American Media sought Saudi financial backing to finance a failed effort to acquire <em>Time</em> magazine, <em>Sports Illustrated,</em> <em>Fortune,</em> and <em>Money,</em> the <em>Journal</em> reported last year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>American Media confirmed the contacts but said the only deal that has ever been discussed with Saudi investors was the expansion of the Mr. Olympia bodybuilding competition, which American Media owns, into the Middle East and North Africa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The lawyer for [publisher <strong>David] Pecker,</strong> <strong>Elkan Abramowitz,</strong> on Sunday on ABC said American Media sought financing “from the Saudis, but never obtained any.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s also the matter of A.M.I.’s long-standing ties to Trump, who has gone out of his way to support Saudi Arabia, including (allegedly!) <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/unusual-statement-disputing-cia-filled-exclamation-points-trump-backs-saudi-n938526\">letting its de facto leader get away with the murder of a U.S. resident</a>. That issue came up last week, when Amazon founder <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> published a blog post <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-ami-medium\">accusing</a> <em>The National Enquirer</em> of attempting to extort him if he didn’t drop his investigation into how his private messages fell into their lap, and publicly state that that he had “no knowledge or basis for suggesting that A.M.I.’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.” As Bezos wrote in his <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/hes-a-genius-wall-street-praises-bezos-for-dick-pic-moxie\">widely praised dick-pic confessional</a>, “the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve.”</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Trump wants investigation into his sham charity halted because New York A.G.s were mean to him</strong></p>\n<p>Back in December, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/donald-trump-charity-shut-down\">shuttered</a> the Donald J. Trump Foundation as part of an agreement with the New York Attorney General’s office, which has alleged that the “charity” served as little more than a slush fund for the former real-estate developer’s business and political interests. In addition to allegedly spending $10,000 of the foundation’s money <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-clue-to-the-whereabouts-of-the-6-foot-tall-portrait-of-donald-trump/2016/09/14/ae65db82-7a8f-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html?utm_term=.76892d132ab1\">on a six-foot-tall oil painting of Trump</a>, the group’s board, made up of the president’s eldest children, never once held a meeting. (Trump Organization C.F.O. <strong>Allen Weisselberg</strong> apparently had no idea he was an officer <a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/779101/trump-foundations-treasurer-didnt-know-treasurer-until-investigators-told\">until investigators told him as much</a>.) Unfortunately for the Donald, simply closing the (<em>alleged</em>) sham charity has not stopped the investigation. “We’ll continue to move our suit forward to ensure that the Trump Foundation and its directors are held to account for their clear and repeated violations of state and federal law,” outgoing N.Y. A.G. <strong>Barbara Underwood</strong> said at the time. So now <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-11/trump-renews-claim-that-n-y-suit-against-his-charity-is-biased\">his lawyers are trying to get it thrown out on the grounds that investigators said mean things about him</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>New York’s June lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation should be barred over comments made by [the state’s new attorney general, <strong>Letitia] James,</strong> and predecessors Barbara Underwood and <strong>Eric Schneiderman,</strong> who were both vocal Trump critics, Trump’s attorney <strong>Alan Futerfas</strong> said in documents filed last week in state court in Manhattan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>James called Trump an “illegitimate president” in the months before her November election and vowed to “use every area of the law” to investigate the real-estate mogul, his businesses, and his family, according to the filing. Statements by all three attorneys general “express clear bias and animus and constitute an unlawful appearance of impropriety.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, it’s not surprising that a person vowing to use “the law” to investigate the president would send shivers down Team Trump’s collective spine, though it’s not clear this tack will work after having already failed a first time. Back in November, New York State Supreme Court Justice <strong>Saliann Scarpulla</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-23/trump-foundation-must-defend-attorney-general-suit-judge-says\">rejected</a> Trump’s attorneys’ attempt to get the suit dismissed on claims of “political bias,” saying, “There is no basis for finding that animus and bias were the sole motivating factors for initiating the investigation and pursuing this proceeding.” Or, in other words, <em>these officials might think you’re the world’s slimiest weasel, but that’s not the ONLY reason they launched this probe.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Founding member of the “Trump Caucus” still blowing campaign funds on leisure-time activities</strong></p>\n<p>Remember Rep. <strong>Duncan Hunter</strong>? For those who need a quick refresher, he’s the California congressman and Trump super-fan who was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/duncan-hunter-indictment\">indicted last year</a>, along with his wife, <strong>Margaret Hunter,</strong> on charges of wire fraud, falsifying records, campaign-finance violations, conspiracy, and “convert[ing] campaign funds to personal use,” the latter of which allegedly <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/22/politics/duncan-hunter-indicted/index.html\">included</a>: a 2015 family vacation to Italy that cost more than $14,000; a $6,500 spring-break trip to Hawaii; a $3,700 jaunt to Las Vegas and Boise; $229 at Disneyland’s Star Trader gift shop; $253.62 at SeaWorld’s Aquatica waterpark; meals at fine-dining establishments and fast-food restaurants alike; a $2,000 birthday gift for a family member to attend a Pittsburgh Steelers game; and a three-night, $1,000 stay at the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa and Casino for a “personal ski trip,” among other things. At the time, the Hunters insisted through a spokesman that the indictment against them was “politically motivated,” with Duncan later trying to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/23/politics/duncan-hunter-wife-margaret-campaign-finances/index.html\">blame everything on his wife</a>. Anyway, it appears that <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-hunter-douglas-drones-20190206-story.html\">the couple is up to their old tricks</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the last five weeks of 2018, Rep. Duncan Hunter’s campaign reported spending hundreds of dollars at a local amusement park and made $2,000 in charges&#8212;now disputed&#8212;to a technology company that flies drones. The spending at Belmont Park, [an amusement park] in Mission Beach, and the disputed charges at ByteSignal, a Missouri-based technology company, are among $119,861 in expenditures Hunter’s campaign disclosed to the Federal Election Commission on Thursday, in a financial report covering November 27 through December 31. During the same weeks, the campaign reported raising $2,376.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, these expenditures are a drop in the bucket compared to the $250,000 in campaign funds the Hunters allegedly misappropriated between 2009 and 2016, but if you’re facing a criminal trial&#8212;the couple has pleaded not guilty&#8212;maybe just use your own money at the amusement park.</p>\n<p><strong>Report: another shutdown would have not-great consequences</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to putting nearly 1 million federal employees out of work (or forcing them to work without pay), a second potential shutdown would <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-11/debt-limit-looms-as-mind-numbing-impasse-stokes-shutdown-risk\">put the U.S. economy at major risk</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The standoff in Washington that’s increasing the chances of another U.S. government shutdown at the end of the week is also raising the specter of bigger risks as the reinstatement of the debt ceiling approaches in early March.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moody’s Investors Service analysts have warned that shutdown 2.0 could have a “more severe impact” on U.S. output. And if it were to extend beyond the March 1 end of the suspension of the current cap on America’s statutory debt capacity, “it would complicate negotiations over the debt ceiling.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Last month, Fitch Ratings’ global head of sovereign ratings, <strong>James McCormack,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-is-turning-america-into-another-bankrupt-casino\">warned</a> that the country’s mounting debt is weighing on the U.S., and the inability to deal with “meaningful fiscal deterioration” with a shut government could put our triple-A rating at risk. (A credit downgrade&#8212;which has only happened once since 1941&#8212;would make it harder for the U.S. government to borrow money and increase borrowing costs.)</p>\n<p><strong>Area man doesn’t understand why Democrats get themselves so wound up over investigations, fascism, the law, etc.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094964052558823424\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094964052558823424\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094964052558823424</a></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>Morgan Stanley, in Its Biggest Deal Since Crisis, Courts Future Millionaires (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-in-its-biggest-deal-since-crisis-courts-future-millionaires-11549885394\"><em>W.S.J.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Kamala Harris calls for marijuana legalization: ‘I think it gives a lot of people joy’ (<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/11/kamala-harris-2020-marijuana-legalization-1163795\">Politico</a>)</p>\n<p>She Spoke Up About Sexual Harassment At Ernst &amp; Young And Got Caught In A Web of Retaliation (<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ernst-and-young-sexual-harassment-karen-ward_us_5c14080ee4b009b8aea73086\">HuffPost</a>)</p>\n<p>Millions of Americans could be stunned as their tax refunds shrink (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/02/10/millions-americans-could-be-stunned-their-tax-refunds-shrink/\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>)</p>\n<p>The Next Wave of ‘Unicorn’ Start-Ups (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/technology/new-wave-unicorn-start-ups.html\"><em>N.Y.T.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Grading the impact of Trump’s China tariffs (<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-tariffs-china-trade-war-impact-8dd42cf5-983a-4eb9-a111-16132eeef1f8.html\">Axios</a>)</p>\n<p>Fyre Fest founder ordered to pay $2.9M to investment company (<a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/02/08/fyre-fest-founder-ordered-to-pay-2-9m-to-investment-company/\"><em>N.Y.P.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Cows Get Own Tinder-Style App for Breeding (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-10/cows-get-tinder-app-as-u-k-breeders-seek-moo-love-for-herds\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>Does Your Company Need to Know Your Body-Mass Index?

Asked by <strong>Abby Huntsman</strong> whether she had any concerns about the project, the senior White House adviser <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/08/politics/ivanka-trump-russia-investigation/index.html\">responded</a> that she knew “literally almost nothing” about a Trump Organization proposal to build a skyscraper in downtown Moscow, and said she had “zero concern” that anyone in her family could be implicated in <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> investigation into Russian efforts to fix the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Of course, Ivanka’s account differs somewhat from various reports suggesting she knew a great deal about the project. According to <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/mueller-eyes-ivanka-don-jr-s-work-trump-tower-moscow-003012099.html\">Yahoo News</a>, both she and <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong> were involved in the project as far back as 2013, and were aware that former Trump lawyer <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> had been working to revive the deal. In October 2015, Trump Sr. signed a letter of intent to move forward with negotiations, but has continued to be evasive about the extent of his ambitions. In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress about the scope of the Trump Tower project, and BuzzFeed News recently reported that the president directed Cohen to say that those negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did, though the special counsel’s office issued an unusual statement disputing the BuzzFeed story as “not accurate.”</p>\n<p>According to the contested BuzzFeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation\">report</a>, both Ivanka and Trump Jr. received “regular, detailed updates” about the project from Cohen. Ivanka would reportedly have managed a spa at the tower, and per BuzzFeed, instructed Cohen to speak with a Russian athlete who had “synergy on a government level” to move the project along. A spokesperson for the First Daughter’s attorney told BuzzFeed that she was only “minimally involved” in proceedings, and “did not know about this proposal until after a non-binding letter of intent had been signed.” Her older brother, meanwhile, has testified under oath that he was only “peripherally aware” of the plans.</p>\n<p>She contested the Yahoo report too, insisting that her involvement in the project was limited to recommending an architect. But in her interview with Huntsman, she offered additional explanations: the Moscow deal was one of many she was juggling, she was too busy to have paid much attention, and it never moved beyond a theoretical stage. “There was never a binding contract,” she told Huntsman during the <em>Good Morning America</em> interview, part of which aired Friday. “I never talked to the&#8212;with a third party outside of the organization about it. It was one of&#8212;I mean, we could have had 40 or 50 deals like that, that were floating around, that somebody was looking at. Nobody visited it to see if it was worth our time. So this was not exactly like an advanced project.”</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing there, yet it’s created weeks and weeks and months of headlines,” she added. “So no, I have zero concern.”</p>\n<h3>More

Both lived on the same block on the Upper East Side. More notably, both were crucial supporting players in the Trump orbit. Cohen had been an indefatigable booster of <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> helping to arrange his real-estate deals, paying off alleged mistresses, and quashing would-be damaging stories regarding his boss. Wolkoff, for a time, was a lesser-known, but equally diligent enforcer for <strong>Melania Trump.</strong></p>\n<p>The two women had met years earlier, when Wolkoff helped produce the Metropolitan Museum’s Costume Institute Benefit. (<strong>Anna Wintour,</strong> who hosts the gala, is editor-in-chief of <em>Vogue</em> and the artistic director of Condé Nast, <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s parent company.) Over the years, Wolkoff would become a member of Melania’s small inner circle. After Trump’s surprise electoral-college victory, she went on to help the First Lady in Washington, serving as a senior adviser to her official governmental office on matters large and small. Wolkoff helped facilitate Melania’s transition to the White House, and advised her on policy platforms, East Wing décor, and her overall messaging.</p>\n<p>The two were close enough that Wolkoff could openly express divergent views. According to sources familiar with the conversations, Wolkoff told Melania and East Wing staffers that the name for her anti-bullying initiative, “Be Best,” sounded illiterate. (The First Lady, according to these sources, feared that an alternative, “Children First,” was too similar to her husband’s “America First” branding.) They also disagreed about the infamous “I Really Don’t Care, Do U?” jacket that the First Lady wore to the U.S.-Mexico border. (Melania, according to these sources, thought the trip would not get attention without such a brazen fashion gesture. In an interview with ABC News in October, she said that she wore the jacket for the media and people who were criticizing her, and wondered aloud whether the trip would have received similar attention without it.) But the two women remained close, nevertheless. On trips to D.C., Wolkoff would sometimes spend the night in the White House residence; other times, she would book a room in the Trump International Hotel down Pennsylvania Avenue. According to e-mail exchanges from the time, she was given the friends and family rate of $345 a night, and told to submit receipts to <strong>Reince Priebus.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/c97a4730-bc95-4032-b21a-a970764c038c?customColor=%23ff0000\"><iframe height=\"220\" width=\"750\" src=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/c97a4730-bc95-4032-b21a-a970764c038c?customColor=%23ff0000\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong><em>iTunes user?

Cohen, of course, went from being one of the president’s closest confidants to one of his most bitter and dangerous adversaries. Wolkoff’s separation was less public, but is increasingly newsworthy. Through her company, WIS Media Partners, Wolkoff oversaw Trump’s sprawling week-long inaugural festivities&#8212;she sourced and managed third-party vendors, entertainers, and broadcasters, and oversaw the themes and production of all the concerts, dinners, balls, and programming. She worked in close proximity to the Trump family and inaugural chair <strong>Tom Barrack,</strong> a billionaire private-equity real-estate investor who had been a close friend of the president for years. And yet a year after the swearing-in ceremony, Wolkoff left the White House amid an uncomfortable public-relations crisis regarding the president’s inaugural committee.</p>\n<p>Last February, <em>The New York Times</em> published an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/politics/trumps-inaugural-committee-paid-26-million-to-first-ladys-friend.html\">article</a> centered on WIS, headlined “Trump’s Inaugural Committee Paid $26 million to Firm of First Lady’s Adviser.” The inaugural committee had raised a stunning $107 million&#8212;about twice what <strong>Barack Obama</strong> had hauled in 2009&#8212;from donors such as <strong>Sheldon Adelson</strong> and corporations like AT&amp;T. But as the <em>Times</em> reported, the tax form revealed profligate spending&#8212;nearly $10 million on travel; $4.6 million on salaries and benefits; and $100,000 to <strong>Rick Gates,</strong> the former campaign aide and deputy chairman of the inauguration who, about a week later, became one of <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> first major cooperating witnesses. Some $40 million was publicly unaccounted for. Wolkoff, as the event planner in charge, became the face of the disarray. The <em>Times</em> story quoted an official from a government watchdog group accusing the inaugural committee of “fiscal mismanagement at its worst.”</p>\n<p>Privately, Wolkoff refuted the characterization. According to bank statements, checks, and internal documents that I’ve reviewed, the $26 million in payment to WIS was largely distributed to third-party vendors and labor. Nearly $24 million was paid for projects related to the work of a subcontractor, Inaugural Productions, an independent organization run by individuals formerly associated with television producer <strong>Mark Burnett,</strong> which was responsible for staging several events. Around $1.6 million was used to compensate 15 contract workers who worked with Wolkoff as staffers. Wolkoff herself received $500,000 for her work on the inauguration. She had submitted audited records to the inauguration committee in March 2017, a month after she signed a gratuitous-services contract to work as an unpaid strategist and senior adviser to the First Lady.</p>\n<p>After the <em>Times</em> article, given her established documentation, Wolkoff urged Melania to defend her. But the administration demurred. <strong>Stephanie Grisham,</strong> the First Lady’s spokesperson, wrote in an e-mail, “This messaging is the best way to go in order to minimize the negative press stories of today and protect FLOTUS &amp; this administration.” A week later, Wolkoff left the East Wing after the White House instilled new security protocols in the wake of the <strong>Rob Porter</strong> scandal. A member of the White House Counsel’s Office called her on February 20, 2018, to let her know that the White House would be terminating all gratuitous-services agreements, including hers. It had nothing to do with her work on the inauguration, this person told her. “I am sorry that the professional part of our relationship has come to an end, but I am comforted in the fact that our [friendship] far outweigh[s] politics,” Melania wrote her in an e-mail later that day. “Thank you Again! Much love.”</p>\n<p>Later that evening, in a phone call, Wolkoff told the First Lady that she worried it appeared as if she had been fired on account of her work on the inauguration. The First Lady urged her not to be “dramatic.” Less than a week later, however, the <em>Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/melania-trump-inauguration-adviser.html\">published a story</a> stating that the severance of Wolkoff’s contract had been “prompted by displeasure from the Trumps” over the $26 million payment. Grisham told the <em>Times</em> that Melania “had no involvement” with the inaugural committee, and “had no knowledge of how funds were spent.” The president would create similar distance. <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> would later say, “The president was focused on the transition during that time, and not on any of the planning for the inauguration.” (A spokeswoman for the First Lady declined to comment for this story, as did the White House.)</p>\n<p>By the time Cohen and Wolkoff spoke last summer, she had returned to her life in New York. He would soon plead guilty to eight counts in a federal courthouse downtown. But Cohen let Wolkoff know that, among other documents and recordings, the F.B.I. had seized hours of their own conversations that he had taped. According to people familiar with the recordings, some of the taped conversations dealt directly with the inauguration. In them, Wolkoff detailed her own contemporaneous concerns with the inauguration&#8212;about how money was being spent, the general chaos of the process, and the involvement of Trump’s adult children. During these conversations, Wolkoff also raised her issues with the two men in charge of the committee: Gates and Barrack.</p>\n<p>These recordings, in part, led the Southern District of New York to launch a criminal investigation into how the inaugural committee spent its record $107 million. Now, the investigation appears to be advancing. In December, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-inauguration-spending-under-criminal-investigation-by-federal-prosecutors-11544736455\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/trump-inauguration-investigation.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported that prosecutors are examining the committee’s spending, and investigating whether foreign donors from nations including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates funneled money to the committee in an effort to influence U.S. policy. On Monday, the inaugural committee received a subpoena from the S.D.N.Y. requesting documents related to spending and donors, vendors, and benefits handed out, as well as documents related to a wealthy donor who had once registered as a foreign agent working on behalf of the Sri Lankan government. The <em>Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-inauguration-spending-under-criminal-investigation-by-federal-prosecutors-11544736455\">reported</a> that prosecutors have asked Gates about the inaugural fund’s spending and its donors. (<strong>Lorin Reisner</strong>, an attorney for Wolkoff, said in a statement: “Stephanie is not going to comment on these reports. She remains proud of her work on the inauguration, and we are confident that her conduct was proper in all respects.” Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>The subpoena is the latest sign that, while the Mueller investigation could be winding down, the Southern District may be probing a variety of Trump-adjacent avenues into the foreseeable future. An inquiry into the inauguration might also be acutely poignant, given Trump’s concurrent association with both his business and his incoming administration in its earliest days. It involved big money and outside influence. And it involved the Trump family in intimate, important ways. Wolkoff, suddenly and unexpectedly, could find herself in the middle of the maelstrom.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Wolkoff had made a career in the events business, but she knew from the outset the inauguration would be a unique, and uniquely Trumpian, experience. First, she was a political novice who knew little about what an inauguration entailed. Then, there was Trump’s controversial reputation. Upon accepting the post on the Friday after his election, Wolkoff quickly reached out to her network of vendors. Most of them, according to people familiar with these conversations, resisted the opportunity to work with Trump. Even Burnett, who Trump enlisted to conjure up reality-show-like gimmicks (such as flying a gaggle of drones over the crowd), wanted to keep his involvement private. (Burnett did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>Moreover, and perhaps not surprisingly, Trump’s family wanted to be involved in certain aspects of the coordination. Part of this, of course, was because they were going to be included in many of the events and, logistically, they had to know where to be and what to wear. It was also because Trump’s adult children have always been involved in affairs pertaining to their father, from his businesses to <em>The Apprentice</em> to his campaign. Each week, Wolkoff met with senior inaugural-committee members to present itemized, detailed updates on the status of her planning and financial reports from each vendor and for each event. She was also making regular presentations to Trump, Melania, and the Trump family about various decisions, so that they could weigh in. (White House spokespeople have previously denied that the Trumps were involved in any planning, and said they knew little about the events.) Trump and <strong>Ivanka</strong> were briefed on Burnett’s drone idea, for instance, after they had met with singer <strong>Andrea Bocelli</strong> in his office in Trump Tower about the possibility of him singing at an event. (The Italian tenor did not end up performing.)</p>\n<p>Trump was focused on the big-picture theatrics. He wanted to arrive on the Mall in a military plane with a military escort, much as he had arrived for tapings of <em>The Apprentice</em> on Trump Organization helicopters. He also wanted to have a full military parade, as well as tanks and helicopters on the ground. Ivanka, meanwhile, had more particular interests, according to e-mail and text exchanges and people familiar with the conversations. Originally, Ivanka wanted to host an event for women on the Wednesday before her father’s swearing-in ceremony. (The plan was ultimately scrapped.) To be helpful, she suggested a photographer who had once shot her for <em>Town &amp; Country</em> as someone who could take the official family portrait. She also offered a D.J. friend of hers from New York as a possible performer. She texted photos of the Obama family standing onstage together, with <strong>Sasha</strong> and <strong>Malia</strong> prominently situated in the middle of the frame. “FYI regarding the swearing in, it is nice to have family with him for this special moment,” she wrote.</p>\n<p>In large part, Wolkoff worried about potential ethical issues surrounding the First Family-elect and their businesses. After all, Gates had been staying in a suite at the Trump Hotel for most of the inaugural planning. More than a dozen inaugural staffers had also been staying there. The <em>Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/trump-inauguration-spending.html\">reported</a> last month that WIS alone had charged $31,000 for hotel rooms in the span of less than two months, including almost $18,000 at the Trump International Hotel. That did not include what was charged for room service, meals, and travel. In all, the Trump International Hotel was paid more than $1.5 million in inaugural funds, according to the <em>Times.</em> (Wolkoff’s contract states that the inaugural committee would reimburse WIS for travel, long-distance phone calls, mail-delivery services, and expenses connected to the performance of its work. WIS stands for “Who Is She,” Wolkoff’s play on her own anonymity.)</p>\n<p>During the course of planning, Wolkoff had corresponded with Ivanka about the cost of using the Trump Hotel for events leading up to the swearing-in ceremony. On December 10, 2016, a Trump Organization employee sent an estimate for a ballroom rental and food and beverage minimum to use the Trump Hotel space for eight days. The price she quoted was $3.6 million, according to an e-mail. A week later, Gates e-mailed Ivanka about the cost. In this exchange, first <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-trumps-inauguration-paid-trumps-company-with-ivanka-in-the-middle\">published</a> this past December by ProPublica and WNYC, Wolkoff flagged her concern. “These events are in PE’s [the president-elect’s] honor at his hotel and one of them is for family and close friends. Please take into consideration that when this is audited it will become public knowledge,” she wrote. (<strong>Peter Mirijanian,</strong> a spokesperson for Ivanka’s counsel <strong>Abbe Lowell,</strong> said in a statement: “When contacted by someone working on the inauguration, Ms. Trump passed the inquiry on to a hotel official and said only that any resulting discussions should be at a ‘fair market rate.’ Ms. Trump was not involved in any additional discussions.”)</p>\n<p>For an event producer used to detailed lists and punctilious itemization, Wolkoff was often caught off guard by the ad-hoc nature of the committee. According to the two people familiar with the matter, Gates approached a couple individuals working on the inauguration and asked if they would be willing to be paid directly for their work by a donor, rather than by the inaugural committee. They had received more donations than they’d initially anticipated, Gates told these people. Skirting the usual payment route could allow the inaugural committee to avoid reporting the full amount raised from donors. (A lawyer for Gates did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>Wolkoff frequently told Melania about her concerns regarding Gates, these people said. She relayed her concern about the high access level of his security pass within Trump Tower and his closeness with the Trump family. In her view, these people said, he exacerbated a situation already fraught with potential conflicts of interest. Members of the inaugural committee talked about how he frequently worked out of <strong>Donald Trump Jr.’s</strong> office. He was in constant communication with the adult children in order to keep them in the loop about decisions surrounding the inauguration.</p>\n<p>Wolkoff also questioned Gates and Barrack about pricing and budgets across the board, according to the people familiar with the conversations. She started to grow concerned about being left out of meetings, particularly as she raised more red flags. Because part of her responsibilities included reviewing all budgets from her vendors and presenting them to other members of the inaugural committee, she studied the line items in order to be able to explain them. At points, she could not justify the numbers coming in. After circulation of a quote from one of their largest event-production vendors, Hargrove LLC, Wolkoff was shocked that no one in the organization appeared willing to question the figures. She suggested that the quote seemed far beyond what the Obama inaugural committee would have been charged in 2009. She sent an e-mail to her team and Barrack on December 31, 2016. “I am DISGUSTED by [Hargrove’s] lack of transparency and entitlement to [the Presidential Inaugural Committee’s] funding,” she wrote. “I can not approve any budget line items because I do not have a clue what these numbers represent!!” (Hargrove did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>One of the most concerning aspects to Wolkoff’s team, according to the people familiar with the situation, was the amount of money and attention being spent on Barrack’s chairman dinner, which he hosted on an evening before the swearing-in. A draft guest list for the event from days before the dinner included the likes of retired Lieutenant General <strong>Mike Flynn,</strong> G.O.P. fund-raiser <strong>Elliott Broidy,</strong> Michael Cohen, and key officials in the incoming administration. Among the list marked as confirmed were seven people described as “foreign ministers” for Saudi Arabia, one foreign minister from Qatar, and one from the United Arab Emirates. They were the only people on the list who were unnamed. (On Tuesday, ProPublica <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-tom-barrack-colony-company-of-trump-inaugural-chair-sought-to-profit\">published</a> a memo that showed Barrack’s investment firm planned to profit from its connections to the Trump administration. A spokesperson called it “an outline of a proposed potential business plan which was never acted upon or implemented.”)</p>\n<p>A spokesman for Barrack declined to comment, but pointed me toward comments Barrack made in a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chairmans-global-dinner-most-exclusive-event-preceding-trump-inauguration-1484571781\"><em>Journal</em> report</a> published days before the inauguration. “The evening is intended to be the president-elect’s first fingerprint on the global canvas of social democracy and outreach,” Barrack said at the time, explaining that the evening was set up to reach out to local international diplomats and create a “hopeful tapestry of international cooperation and respect.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Much has been made of the various problems with the inauguration, from the lackluster crowd size to the president’s own “American carnage” speech, which struck a tone so dark that <strong>George W. Bush</strong> was reportedly heard calling it “some weird shit.” But Wolkoff’s part, the event itself, went off without a hitch, and the family was pleased. The day after the swearing-in ceremony was Wolkoff’s birthday. The Trumps sent flowers to the Trump Hotel room where she had been staying. She flew back to New York on a military plane with Melania, her stylist, hairdresser, makeup artist, and the rest of the Trump family, apart from the president, Ivanka, and <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> who remained in Washington.</p>\n<p>Much is still unknown about how inaugural funds were managed, or if the unaccounted for $40-odd million will ever be publicly explained. It’s unclear whether there was foreign influence, or illicit attempts to profit off of proceedings. What Gates has offered investigators&#8212;about anything, really, but about the inauguration, in particular&#8212;is also unclear. How deep the Southern District’s investigation into all of this is yet unknown. But much like some of Cohen’s other taped conversations, the discussions with Wolkoff about the inauguration may have turned out to be consequential. On the witness stand during <strong>Paul Manafort’s</strong> trial in Virginia last summer, prosecutors asked Gates if he charged personal expenses to the committee. “It’s possible,” he responded.</p>\n<p>As investigators continue to pursue the matter, they may find themselves in a familiar situation: seeking out former Trump allies-turned-adversaries who saw it all go down firsthand. One of the most inexplicable plot points in the whirling Trump drama has been the president’s public treatment of his former lawyer. Trump was aware that Cohen possessed all manner of damaging information about him, and yet he wasted few opportunities to disparage him publicly. Ultimately, Cohen implicated Trump in federal campaign-finance violations as he pleaded guilty. He spent more than 70 hours cooperating with federal investigators, opening his book to tell them what he knew about the president, his business, and the campaign. While Wolkoff’s treatment has been gentler, she’s been similarly isolated and publicly disparaged. And now, what she knows could be of interest to investigators, too.</p>\n<p><em>This story has been updated to reflect Mark Burnett&#39;s connection to Inaugural Productions.</em></p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Trump’s World","socialTitle":"“I Am Disgusted”: Behind the Scenes of Trump’s $107 Million Inauguration","socialDescription":"Stephanie Winston Wolkoff was the mastermind event producer behind Trump’s inaugural celebration, which has since come under S.D.N.Y. investigation.

let go of his longtime rivalry with <em>S.N.L.,</em> squeezing in a ding at the “Democrat spin machine” here, a defense of <strong>Kanye West</strong> there, but largely ignoring its jabs. That appeared to change Sunday morning, as Trump resumed his full-throated attacks after a particularly scathing series of sketches. “Nothing funny about tired <em>Saturday Night Live</em> on Fake News NBC!” he tweeted.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The president presumably caught wind of Saturday’s cold open, which featured <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> reprising his long-standing impression to mock the president’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-national-emergency-declaration-wall\">declaration</a> of a national emergency on Friday.

Mick Mulvaney, chafing at the family, is eyeing the exits, as is Larry Kudlow.","body":"<p>After the pummeling he incurred during the 35-day shutdown&#8212;a self-inflicted punishment&#8212;<strong>Donald Trump</strong> was looking forward to his State of the Union address, seeing it as a presidential safe space where at least some of the attendees <em>had</em> to applaud for him. “He was in a great mood and really seemed ready to go,” a Republican who spoke with Trump before the speech told me. The generally positive response from his favored outlets&#8212;Drudge’s headline blared “Trump Rocks House”&#8212;has pleased the president this week, sources said. “He’s been in a good mood,” another prominent Republican said. And the no-socialism themes were seen as a potent weapon against Democrats in 2020&#8212;the first hopeful sign in a while.</p>\n<p>But while the State of the Union adjusted the president’s mood, it wasn’t enough to re-align the underlying dysfunction of the West Wing. Morale inside the White House, never high to begin with, has turned particularly bleak, according to interviews with 10 former West Wing officials and Republicans close to the president. The issue is that many see Trump himself as the problem. “Trump is hated by everyone inside the White House,” a former West Wing official told me. His shambolic management style, paranoia, and pattern of blaming staff for problems of his own making have left senior White House officials burned out and resentful, sources said. “It’s total misery. People feel trapped,” a former official said. “Trump always needs someone to blame,” a second former official said. Sources said the leak of Trump’s private schedules to Axios&#8212;which revealed how little work Trump actually does&#8212;was a signal of how disaffected his staff has become.</p>\n<p>White House Communications Director <strong>Bill Shine</strong> has told friends he’s angry that Trump has singled him out for the bad press during the government shutdown. “Bill is like, ‘you’re the guy who steps on the message more than anyone,’” said a Republican who’s spoken with Shine recently. Economic adviser <strong>Larry Kudlow</strong> has told people he’s probably got six months left. “Larry’s really tired of it all,” a source close to Kudlow said.</p>\n<p>What’s driving a lot of the frustration is that Trump, now more than ever, runs the West Wing as a family business. Four sources said the only White House advisers he truly consults are daughter <strong>Ivanka</strong> and son-in-law <strong>Jared Kushner.</strong> “This is a family affair, and if you’re not in the family, you’ve got problems,” a former official said. The special privileges and access afforded to Kushner and Ivanka have been alienating Trump’s acting chief of staff, <strong>Mick Mulvaney.</strong> “Mick is not entirely thrilled with the family,” a Republican close to Mulvaney told me. Multiple sources said Mulvaney is looking for a way out of the West Wing. He’s said to be interested in a Cabinet position, either at the Commerce Department or Treasury, and he’s reportedly been pursuing the University of South Carolina presidency. A senior White House official recently lobbied a friend of Mulvaney’s to convince Mulvaney to stay.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Mulvaney is working to stave off another political crisis before Trump either shuts the government down again or declares a state of emergency to fund his southern border wall. One source briefed on the internal debate said that Mulvaney is advising Trump to accept less than his demand of $5 billion and make up the difference by shuffling money around the existing budget. “Mick wants to re-program existing funds,” the source said. Trump has insisted he won’t compromise, but he faces no good options, with a G.O.P. revolt likely if he goes the national-emergency route. “Trump is going to declare whatever happens a victory,” a former West Wing official said.</p>\n<p>The White House declined to comment.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Capitol Hill","socialTitle":"“Trump Is Hated by Everyone”: Trump’s SOTU Euphoria Masks West Wing Misery","socialDescription":"The leak of his schedules is a sign of deep disaffection.

But when it comes to the federal contractors who also went unpaid during that period&#8212;up to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/13/18223471/back-pay-federal-contractors-shutdown\">580,000 people</a>, according to one estimate&#8212;it gets trickier. “I’ve been told the president won’t sign” anything that guarantees them back pay, Senator <strong>Roy Blunt</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-blocking-contractor-back-pay-gov-t-funding-deal-lawmaker-n971226\">told reporters</a> on Wednesday. “I guess federal contractors are different in his view than federal employees.”</p>\n<p>On the 2016 campaign trail, it was a well-known (but ultimately overlooked) fact that Trump <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-business-plan-left-a-trail-of-unpaid-bills-1465504454\">routinely refused to pay contractors</a> during his career as a businessman. But the idea of paying these contractors reportedly had bipartisan support, until <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> shot it down. A legislative source <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/429827-push-to-include-contractor-back-pay-in-funding-deal-hits-gop-roadblock\">told</a> the Hill that the administrative cost alone to pay back the contractors would be as high as the back pay itself, and that previous shutdown negotiations did not include this provision. “That was not initially part of our deal,” Senator <strong>Richard Shelby</strong> explained. “I personally would rather keep it narrow in scope.”</p>\n<p>Other Republicans, such as <strong>John Cornyn,</strong> seemed to take joy in turning contractor pain to political gain. “<strong>[Nancy] Pelosi</strong> and <strong>[Chuck] Schumer</strong> should have thought about this and other collateral damage when they initially refused to negotiate on border security, something they are apparently now willing to do,” he told NBC News. “Thousands of federal contractors have not been reimbursed from the 35-day shutdown,” Schumer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1095770911196831744\">said</a> in response to these reports. “This issue is hanging in the balance. . . . It’s just not fair.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

of Trump’s infamous hue?","body":"<p>Long before <strong>President Trump</strong> decried investigations of his office over Twitter, a gentler query dogged the celebrity businessman: how does he maintain his infamous orange hue, even while residing in wintry D.C.? It’s a question that persists into the third year of Trump’s tenure in the White House, and investigations of the matter have yielded surprising insight into the commander in chief’s styling habits.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/us/politics/trump-tan.html\">The New York Times</a></em> pursued the idea as a matter of Trump’s health, though a senior administration official only offered that Trump’s notable tan&#8212;in February, no less&#8212;is the result of “good genes.” Further investigation revealed that neither tanning beds nor spray-tan booths exist within the White House or Air Force One, at least according to senior officials. Former aide <strong>Omarosa Manigault Newman</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/death-spiral-why-omarosa-totally-triggered-trump\">wrote in a tell-all book</a> that Trump travels with a tanning bed, while lighter-hued circles around the president’s eyes have fueled speculation that he utilizes goggles to protect himself from ultraviolet rays.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, neither bronzer nor tanning cream has been observed among Trump’s bathroom grooming products, at least when the president has offered a tour of the facilities to supporters. Trump, who suffers from rosacea, is reported to apply his own translucent makeup powder before television appearances, and has even adjusted the lighting at White House events to avoid appearing too orange on-screen. When possible, he prefers the natural light of the White House Rose Garden.</p>\n<p>Trump’s orange hue has also proven a frequent source of media ridicule, even as <em>Saturday Night Live</em> star <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> has suggested makeup artists deliberately avoid exaggerating the shade&#8212;at <strong>Lorne Michaels’s</strong> behest&#8212;so as “not to over-orange anything out of malice.” Baldwin has otherwise described Trump’s look as somewhere between “Mark Rothko orange” and a “slightly paler Orange Crush.”</p>\n<p>The president is famously self-sufficient when it comes to appearance, even detailing the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/photos/2015/09/an-illustrated-history-of-donald-trumps-hair\">elaborate process</a> behind his signature swooping blond hair. And while an unnamed former campaign hand admitted Trump’s orange glow is “a captivating story,” they insisted Trump’s grooming habits are his own secret to keep.</p>","rubric":"45

The following is a list of his career highlights that presumably convinced Trump he should be given a job guiding the U.S.’s monetary policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>9-9-9:</strong> While running for president, Cain famously introduced a tax proposal called the 9-9-9 plan, which would have eliminated the tax system entirely and <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/sep/26/facts-about-herman-cains-9-9-9-tax-plan/\">replaced</a> it with a 9 percent personal income tax, a 9 percent corporate income tax, and a 9 percent national sales tax. Economists <a href=\"http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/9-9-9-the-most-massive-redistribution-of-taxes-ever-seriously-considered/\">called</a> it “The most massively regressive redistribution of taxes ever seriously considered” and <a href=\"https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/15/cain-unable/\">warned</a> that it would be “a huge tax increase on most Americans, but a huge tax cut on the wealthy.” (<strong>Paul Ryan</strong> and <strong>Larry Kudlow</strong> were, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/larry-kudlow-wants-trump-to-cut-taxes-again\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/paul-ryan-retirement-speech\">course</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/paul-ryan-loves-herman-cains-9-9-9-tax-plan-2011-10\">big</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/id/44909981\">fans</a>.)

And when they ask me who is the president of Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan I’m going to say, you know, I don’t know. Do you know?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-<strong>Gold:</strong> As of his presidential run, Cain <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/05/herman-cain-federal-reserve-chairman-tea-party-champion/239519/\">favored</a> a return to the gold standard, and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304070304577395891113592150\">wrote</a> in an op-ed for <em>The Wall Street Journal:</em> “A gold standard is to the moochers and looters in government what sunlight and garlic are to vampires.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pizza:</strong> Cain was the chief executive officer of Godfather’s Pizza. Trump obviously believes this makes Cain more qualified for the job than some loser PhD.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>-<strong>Sexual harassment:</strong> During Cain’s run for office, Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2011/10/exclusive-2-women-accused-cain-of-inappropriate-behavior-067194\">reported</a> that at least two female employees at the National Restaurant Association received financial settlements after making sexual harassment claims against Cain when he served as the group’s president. Cain vacillated between saying he was “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/01/herman-cain-settlement-sexual-harassment\">unaware of any sort of settlement</a>,” to admitting that they happened and he knew about them, to calling the whole thing a “witch hunt,” a line that undoubtedly scored him points with the Big Guy, who has been <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/women-accused-trump-sexual-misconduct-list-2017-12\">accused</a> of sexual misconduct by 22 separate women and has made “witch hunt” his <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/witches-to-trump-stop-calling-the-mueller-investigation-a-witch-hunt\">catchphrase</a> of choice.</p>\n<p>Shockingly for this administration, Cain <em>does</em> have some relevant work experience, having served as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City from 1992 to 1996, though, as <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/31/trump-considers-former-gop-presidential-candidate-herman-cain-federal-reserve/?utm_term=.0a2473cba88d\">notes</a>, “those posts are often given to business executives and community leaders who serve to inform top Fed officials about what they are seeing in the labor market and economy more broadly.” Or, as Dartmouth College economics professor <strong>Danny Blanchflower,</strong> who previously sat on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, put it:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/D_Blanchflower/status/1091015619061919745\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/D_Blanchflower/status/1091015619061919745\">https://twitter.com/D_Blanchflower/status/1091015619061919745</a></p></blockquote></div><p>One potential factor that <em>could</em> derail Cain’s candidacy? When he served on the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, he was known as an inflation hawk, which is the exact opposite of what Trump wants from the Fed, as exemplified by the fact that his handpicked Fed chair, <strong>Jerome Powell,</strong> is <em>this close</em> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/trump-spends-christmas-eve-trashing-the-federal-reserve\">to waking up with a horse’s head in his bed</a>. Still, it’s entirely possible, as <em>New York</em>’s <strong>Josh Barro</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbarro/status/1091013868715995137\">points out</a>, that “Trump assumes Cain has no fixed ideology and would do whatever he wants.” Anyway, if this Cain thing doesn’t work out, <strong>Jose Canseco</strong> is presumably <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/12/jose-canseco-wants-to-run-the-federal-reserve\">still interested in the gig</a>!</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Bernie Sanders not about to sit back and let Elizabeth Warren have all the fun</strong></p>\n<p>You want a “soak the rich”&#8211;style tax proposal? <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/01/31/bernie-sanders-propose-dramatic-expansion-estate-tax-richest-americans-including-percent-rate-billionaires/\">You got it</a>!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will unveil a plan Thursday to dramatically expand the federal estate tax on the wealthy, including a new 77 percent rate on billionaires&#39; estates, as leading Democratic politicians push new taxes on the richest Americans to combat inequality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sanders’s bill, the “For the 99.8% Act,” would tax the estates of the 0.2 percent of Americans who inherit more than $3.5 million, while the rest of the country “would not see their taxes go up by one penny under this plan,” according to aides to the Vermont senator, who is considering a 2020 presidential bid. . . . Sanders’s plan would restore the 77 percent top estate tax rate that was in place in the U.S. from 1941 to 1976, tax estates worth more than $3.5 million, and create several new estate tax brackets, including a 55 percent rate on estates worth more than $50 million.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Our bill does what the American people want us to be doing and that is to demand that the very wealthiest families in this country start paying their fair share of taxes,” Sanders <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/01/31/bernie-sanders-propose-dramatic-expansion-estate-tax-richest-americans-including-percent-rate-billionaires/?utm_term=.2268c54a4430\">said</a> in a press release. Of the decision by three top Republican senators this week to release a plan that would expunge the estate tax&#8212;already weakened from last year’s legislation&#8212;Sanders commented: “It is literally beyond belief that the Republican leadership wants to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top 0.2 percent of our population. . . . This is not only insane, it tells us the degree to which the billionaire class controls the Republican Party.”</p>\n<p><strong>Democrats are coming for Trump’s tax returns</strong></p>\n<p>Cue cries of “WITCH HUNT!” in <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/31/house-democrats-take-first-step-to-go-after-trumps-tax-returns.html\">3 . . . 2 . . .</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A House committee will hold a hearing next week on presidential tax returns as Democrats clamor for access to President Donald Trump’s elusive financial information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rep. <strong>John Lewis,</strong> a Georgia Democrat and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee’s Oversight Subcommittee, announced the event will take place on Feb. 7. The hearing in front of the Democratic-led panel is called “Legislative Proposals and Tax Law Related to Presidential and Vice-Presidential Tax Returns.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It marks the new Democratic House majority’s first formal step on the path to focusing on Trump’s tax returns. The president refused to release the documents during the 2016 campaign, in a break with decades of precedent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“This is the beginning of a court case,” Ways and Means Committee Chairman <strong>Richard Neal</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/29/politics/trump-tax-returns/index.html\">told</a> CNN. “I think the idea here is to avoid the emotion of the moment and make sure that the product stands up under critical analysis. And it will.”</p>\n<p><strong>Of course the White House used the shutdown to chip away at workers’ rights</strong></p>\n<p>With everyone focused on the wall, the Trump administration decided it was a great time to relieve employers of the burden of reporting workplace injuries to the Department of Labor, as part of the presidency’s ongoing attempt to return to the good old days when business owners didn’t have to comply with health and safety laws that obviously serve no other purpose than to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/29/18197346/trump-labor-electronic-injury-reporting-rule\">eat into their profits</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The partial government shutdown may have disrupted air travel and triggered financial hardship, but it didn’t stop the White House from continuing to dismantle regulations meant to protect U.S. workers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On Friday, the Trump administration gutted a 2016 rule that required most employers to electronically submit detailed reports of all workplace injuries to the Department of Labor each year&#8212;reports they’ve long been required to keep, but never required to submit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses rule would have allowed the government, for the first time, to get more complete data on how many U.S. workers are injured on the job and how those injuries happened. Enacted under the Obama administration, it was supposed to help inspectors identify dangerous work conditions, and in turn pressure businesses to comply with workplace safety laws.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Vox, the Office of Management and Budget “rushed the amendment through the three-month review process in just six weeks&#8212;even though the office was closed during the shutdown and two-thirds of the office’s employees were furloughed,” with the changes finalized on and published by Friday.</p>\n<p><strong>Hedge-fund C.E.O. thinks policy of ripping colleagues to shreds is actually really nice</strong></p>\n<p>“It’s kind of a family atmosphere,” Bridgewater Associates co-C.E.O. <strong>Eileen Murray</strong> <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/eileen-murray-bridgewater-associates-co-ceo-hails-hedge-funds-culture-51548870197\">said</a> of the firm’s unorthodox culture wherein employees must earn “<a href=\"https://inside.bwater.com/publications/principles_excerpt\">the right to have an opinion</a>,” are fired <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/what-in-gods-name-is-happening-at-the-worlds-largest-hedge-fund\">in firm-wide e-mails</a>, and are taken to task by the group in meetings called “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/business/dealbook/bridgewaters-ray-dalio-spreads-his-gospel-of-radical-transparency.html\">public hangings</a>.” She added: “I don’t know about you, but for me, my family tells me things I don’t want to hear. But they do it out of a sense of love and kindness . . . Some people think [the culture] sounds harsh and stressful. I think it’s very kind.”</p>\n<p><strong>Area man is very smart, very knowledgable about how stock market works</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed

Let Koch’s expert on water and chemical regulations decide.","body":"<p>Of all the federal agencies that fall under <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> purview, none embodies the administration’s unofficial mandate to do the exact opposite of its stated mission quite like the Environmental Protection Agency. For the last two years, the E.P.A.&#8212;which, as a reminder, is supposed to be protecting human health and the environment&#8212;has done everything in its power to turn the planet into an ashtray and convince Americans that toxic chemicals are actually totally fine to drink, breathe, and otherwise ingest, all in an effort to help companies secreting those chemicals maximize their profits. Which is to say, we probably should have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/04/former-koch-official-runs-epa-chemical-research-1136230\">seen this one coming</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Trump administration has placed a former Koch Industries official in charge of research that will shape how the government regulates a class of toxic chemicals contaminating millions of Americans’ drinking water&#8212;an issue that could have major financial repercussions for his former employer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Dunlap,</strong> a deputy in E.P.A.’s Office of Research and Development, is playing a key role as the agency decides how to protect people from the pollution left behind at hundreds of military bases and factories across the country. . .He spent the previous eight years as Koch Industries’ lead expert on water and chemical regulations, a position that typically includes helping companies to limit regulatory restrictions and liability for cleanups.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dunlap was hired in October, according to previously undisclosed documents. Since then, he has been extremely busy, having reportedly been involved in high-level meetings that preceded the agency’s decision <em>not</em> to set drinking water limits for chemicals known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which “have been linked with kidney and testicular cancer, as well as other ailments.” (In a statement, <strong>David Ross</strong>, EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Water, told the Hive: “Despite what is being reported, EPA has not finalized or publicly issued its PFAS management plan, and any information that speculates what is included in the plan is premature. The agency is committed to following the Safe Drinking Water Act process for evaluating new drinking water standards, which is just one of the many components of the draft plan that is currently undergoing interagency review.”) According to Politico, Dunlap has been able to avoid a Senate confirmation hearing in which his prior work experience might come up because Trump has not officially nominated anyone to run to office. (Dunlap’s <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/research/david-dunlap\">official bio</a> on the E.P.A. Web site declines to mention any of his employers during his “more than 30 years” working for “private industry, trade associations and as an environmental consultant.”) Currently, Koch subsidiary Georgia-Pacific, a paper and pulp conglomerate, is facing at least one class-action suit related to chemicals now under Dunlap’s purview.</p>\n<p>Koch’s various environmental crimes against humanity are laid out in several high-profile lawsuits over the past 20 years. According to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111005022145/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-02/koch-brothers-flout-law-getting-richer-with-secret-iran-sales.html\">Bloomberg</a>, “Koch Industries was assessed more than $400 million in fines, penalties, and judgments” between 1999 and 2003, such as for dumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of aviation fuel into a Minnesota wetland. “You want an independent, hardheaded scientific review of these issues; you don’t want somebody who is already taking the industry party line,” <strong>Erik Olson,</strong> who heads up the Natural Resources Defense Council’s public health work, told Politico. “There’s a legitimate threat there and, from my perspective, the conflicts of interest that [Dunlap] has having worked as a regulatory compliance director at Georgia-Pacific raises questions about whether he can make those objective decisions or should be recused.”</p>\n<p>Dunlap, of course, is unlikely to be replaced by someone without a host of conflicts of interest given that the guy currently running the E.P.A., <strong>Andrew Wheeler,</strong> is a walking, talking conflict of interest, having <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/07/06/626525274/get-to-know-andrew-wheeler-ex-coal-lobbyist-with-inside-track-to-lead-epa\">served as a coal-lobbyist</a> prior to taking over the top job from departed Grift King <strong>Scott Pruitt.</strong> It is, in other words, par for the course.

Trump</strong> has jumped the gun. Last week, the Trump administration revealed plans to remove all American troops from Syria by the end of April&#8212;a position long championed by the president. The move rankled even some congressional allies like Senator <strong>Lindsey Graham,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">apparently</a> made his displeasure known to Acting Defense Secretary <strong>Patrick Shanahan</strong> over the weekend. Now, it’s clear lawmakers weren’t the only ones blindsided by the planned withdrawal&#8212;key United States allies appear to have been left out of the loop as well.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/allies-say-they-wont-remain-in-syria-after-us-troops-withdraw/2019/02/20/62e503b2-3532-11e9-a400-e481bf264fdc_story.html?utm_term=.9c6870c65501\">reported</a> that U.S. allies “unanimously” declined the Trump administration’s request to pick up the slack fighting ISIS in Syria if the U.S. removes its troops in the spring, as Trump has apparently directed Shanahan to do. A senior administration official told the <em>Post</em> that allies have made it clear they “won’t stay if you pull out.” Trump’s hasty move, then, could leave behind a powder keg. “It’s not safe to leave these enemies there, without any referee or mediating force,” said a U.S. official.</p>\n<p>His approach to Syria is the latest example of Trump’s seeming tendency to push policy without working out the details, which has frustrated even some of his closest allies. “That’s the dumbest fucking idea I’ve ever heard,” Graham evidently <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">told</a> Shanahan of Trump’s withdrawal plan in a meeting in Munich last Saturday. The South Carolina Republican, normally a staunch defender of the president, has been venting about the administration’s Syria policy since December, when Trump suddenly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/donald-trump-syria-troops\">announced</a> it would be up to other nations to fight ISIS there&#8212;despite also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1075397797929775105\">claiming</a> that the terrorist organization had been “defeated.” Graham torched the policy, saying at the time that he would “hold the administration accountable for this decision,” and threatened hearings over the planned move.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to imagine that any president would wake up and make this kind of decision with this little communication,” Republican Senator <strong>Bob Corker</strong> said at the time.</p>\n<p>But it appears that’s precisely how Trump has approached one of the most complicated foreign-policy conundrums of his presidency. While the commander-in-chief seemingly continues to talk out of his ass&#8212;on Friday, he said he would announce the “eradication of the caliphate . . . over the next 24 hours,” but no such announcement has come&#8212;U.S. allies appear to be losing patience. Last week, French Foreign Minister <strong>Jean-Yves Le Drian</strong> <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/u-s-pullout-from-syria-benefits-iran-says-french-fm-1.6938647\">called</a> Trump’s call for withdrawal a “mystery,” and British Foreign Secretary <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> has said that “there is no prospect of British forces replacing the Americans” in Syria. Their pushback has left Trump hanging. Whether it will be enough to force him to reconsider remains to be seen.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a

These are all things <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has said or tweeted about his apparently unprecedented, Herculean work ethic since moving into the Oval Office. One thing he hasn’t tweeted? “I had a giant golf simulator built in the White House to break up <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/364094-trump-watches-at-least-four-hours-of-tv-per-day-report\">my long hours of TV watching</a> on the days I can’t make it to one of my many golf courses, where I’ve spent hundreds of mornings and afternoons over the past two years.” But according to <em>The Washington Post,</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/president-trump-installed-a-room-sized-golf-simulator-at-white-house/2019/02/13/ed3f6d5c-2e45-11e9-813a-0ab2f17e305b_story.html\">he has</a> in fact done just that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>President Trump has installed a room-sized “golf simulator” game at the White House, which allows him to play virtual rounds at courses all over the world by hitting a ball into a large video screen, according to two people told about the system. . . .

He often spends this time watching TV, tweeting, holding impromptu meetings and making phone calls, aides have said. Trump has played golf&#8212;the traditional kind, on an outdoor course&#8212;about 139 times as president, largely at his own golf clubs, according to an analysis by <em>The Washington Post.</em> There is no way to have an exact count because he usually does not acknowledge having played.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For those of you keeping track, an installation that took place “during the last few weeks” likely occurred at the tail end of the government shutdown, a period in which Trump reportedly <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-misses-mar-lago-stuck-white-house-shutdown-report-1292157\">complained</a> to friends about missing Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach resort and golf club of choice. Apparently, he got so wound up that he never again wanted to contemplate a situation in which he wouldn’t be able to stop whatever else he was doing during “executive time” to whack a few balls. (Thankfully, Trump broke his days-not-playing-golf streak on February 2, getting a round in with <strong>Tiger Woods</strong> and <strong>Jack Nicklaus</strong> at his course in Jupiter, Florida.)</p>\n<p>While Trump’s unparalleled laziness has been well-documented&#8212;we’ve known for some time now that the president <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/trump-schedule-executive-time\">rarely makes it out of the residence before 11 A.M., and punches out just after 4 P.M.</a>&#8212;people would probably care a lot less about his golf routine if he hadn’t spent eight years going after Obama (who also had an on-site simulator, though an “an older, less sophisticated” version) for the same nasty habit.

In fact, the whole thing felt so bizarre and over-the-top obsequious that A.M.I. apparently had some qualms of its own.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/national-enquirer-publisher-asked-justice-department-for-advice-on-saudi-connection-11549908996\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, the publisher “sought advice from the Justice Department” last year over whether its obvious propaganda would cross the line between substandard journalism and literally working as an agent of a foreign government. While A.M.I. claimed in the past that Saudi officials had no role in the magazine’s creation, in fact, the publisher gave an adviser to the Kingdom a draft of the magazine and followed the adviser’s editorial advice, per a letter to the D.O.J. However, because there was no official contract stating the company <em>had</em> to follow the adviser’s suggestions&#8212;because, in other words, A.M.I. did so simply out of its love for M.B.S., or as a person familiar with the matter put it, in an attempt to “kiss his ass”&#8212;the Justice Department ruled that the publisher was not required to register as a foreign agent, a conclusion it warned could change if the facts “are different in any way from those depicted in your submission.”</p>\n<p>Of course, last summer’s glossy isn’t the only time A.M.I. has crossed paths with the Kingdom, directly or indirectly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In recent years, American Media sought Saudi financial backing to finance a failed effort to acquire <em>Time</em> magazine, <em>Sports Illustrated,</em> <em>Fortune,</em> and <em>Money,</em> the <em>Journal</em> reported last year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>American Media confirmed the contacts but said the only deal that has ever been discussed with Saudi investors was the expansion of the Mr. Olympia bodybuilding competition, which American Media owns, into the Middle East and North Africa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The lawyer for [publisher <strong>David] Pecker,</strong> <strong>Elkan Abramowitz,</strong> on Sunday on ABC said American Media sought financing “from the Saudis, but never obtained any.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s also the matter of A.M.I.’s long-standing ties to Trump, who has gone out of his way to support Saudi Arabia, including (allegedly!) <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/unusual-statement-disputing-cia-filled-exclamation-points-trump-backs-saudi-n938526\">letting its de facto leader get away with the murder of a U.S. resident</a>. That issue came up last week, when Amazon founder <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> published a blog post <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-ami-medium\">accusing</a> <em>The National Enquirer</em> of attempting to extort him if he didn’t drop his investigation into how his private messages fell into their lap, and publicly state that that he had “no knowledge or basis for suggesting that A.M.I.’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.” As Bezos wrote in his <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/hes-a-genius-wall-street-praises-bezos-for-dick-pic-moxie\">widely praised dick-pic confessional</a>, “the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve.”</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Trump wants investigation into his sham charity halted because New York A.G.s were mean to him</strong></p>\n<p>Back in December, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/donald-trump-charity-shut-down\">shuttered</a> the Donald J. Trump Foundation as part of an agreement with the New York Attorney General’s office, which has alleged that the “charity” served as little more than a slush fund for the former real-estate developer’s business and political interests. In addition to allegedly spending $10,000 of the foundation’s money <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-clue-to-the-whereabouts-of-the-6-foot-tall-portrait-of-donald-trump/2016/09/14/ae65db82-7a8f-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html?utm_term=.76892d132ab1\">on a six-foot-tall oil painting of Trump</a>, the group’s board, made up of the president’s eldest children, never once held a meeting. (Trump Organization C.F.O. <strong>Allen Weisselberg</strong> apparently had no idea he was an officer <a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/779101/trump-foundations-treasurer-didnt-know-treasurer-until-investigators-told\">until investigators told him as much</a>.) Unfortunately for the Donald, simply closing the (<em>alleged</em>) sham charity has not stopped the investigation. “We’ll continue to move our suit forward to ensure that the Trump Foundation and its directors are held to account for their clear and repeated violations of state and federal law,” outgoing N.Y. A.G. <strong>Barbara Underwood</strong> said at the time. So now <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-11/trump-renews-claim-that-n-y-suit-against-his-charity-is-biased\">his lawyers are trying to get it thrown out on the grounds that investigators said mean things about him</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>New York’s June lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation should be barred over comments made by [the state’s new attorney general, <strong>Letitia] James,</strong> and predecessors Barbara Underwood and <strong>Eric Schneiderman,</strong> who were both vocal Trump critics, Trump’s attorney <strong>Alan Futerfas</strong> said in documents filed last week in state court in Manhattan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>James called Trump an “illegitimate president” in the months before her November election and vowed to “use every area of the law” to investigate the real-estate mogul, his businesses, and his family, according to the filing. Statements by all three attorneys general “express clear bias and animus and constitute an unlawful appearance of impropriety.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, it’s not surprising that a person vowing to use “the law” to investigate the president would send shivers down Team Trump’s collective spine, though it’s not clear this tack will work after having already failed a first time. Back in November, New York State Supreme Court Justice <strong>Saliann Scarpulla</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-23/trump-foundation-must-defend-attorney-general-suit-judge-says\">rejected</a> Trump’s attorneys’ attempt to get the suit dismissed on claims of “political bias,” saying, “There is no basis for finding that animus and bias were the sole motivating factors for initiating the investigation and pursuing this proceeding.” Or, in other words, <em>these officials might think you’re the world’s slimiest weasel, but that’s not the ONLY reason they launched this probe.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Founding member of the “Trump Caucus” still blowing campaign funds on leisure-time activities</strong></p>\n<p>Remember Rep. <strong>Duncan Hunter</strong>? For those who need a quick refresher, he’s the California congressman and Trump super-fan who was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/duncan-hunter-indictment\">indicted last year</a>, along with his wife, <strong>Margaret Hunter,</strong> on charges of wire fraud, falsifying records, campaign-finance violations, conspiracy, and “convert[ing] campaign funds to personal use,” the latter of which allegedly <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/22/politics/duncan-hunter-indicted/index.html\">included</a>: a 2015 family vacation to Italy that cost more than $14,000; a $6,500 spring-break trip to Hawaii; a $3,700 jaunt to Las Vegas and Boise; $229 at Disneyland’s Star Trader gift shop; $253.62 at SeaWorld’s Aquatica waterpark; meals at fine-dining establishments and fast-food restaurants alike; a $2,000 birthday gift for a family member to attend a Pittsburgh Steelers game; and a three-night, $1,000 stay at the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa and Casino for a “personal ski trip,” among other things. At the time, the Hunters insisted through a spokesman that the indictment against them was “politically motivated,” with Duncan later trying to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/23/politics/duncan-hunter-wife-margaret-campaign-finances/index.html\">blame everything on his wife</a>. Anyway, it appears that <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-hunter-douglas-drones-20190206-story.html\">the couple is up to their old tricks</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the last five weeks of 2018, Rep. Duncan Hunter’s campaign reported spending hundreds of dollars at a local amusement park and made $2,000 in charges&#8212;now disputed&#8212;to a technology company that flies drones. The spending at Belmont Park, [an amusement park] in Mission Beach, and the disputed charges at ByteSignal, a Missouri-based technology company, are among $119,861 in expenditures Hunter’s campaign disclosed to the Federal Election Commission on Thursday, in a financial report covering November 27 through December 31. During the same weeks, the campaign reported raising $2,376.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, these expenditures are a drop in the bucket compared to the $250,000 in campaign funds the Hunters allegedly misappropriated between 2009 and 2016, but if you’re facing a criminal trial&#8212;the couple has pleaded not guilty&#8212;maybe just use your own money at the amusement park.</p>\n<p><strong>Report: another shutdown would have not-great consequences</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to putting nearly 1 million federal employees out of work (or forcing them to work without pay), a second potential shutdown would <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-11/debt-limit-looms-as-mind-numbing-impasse-stokes-shutdown-risk\">put the U.S. economy at major risk</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The standoff in Washington that’s increasing the chances of another U.S. government shutdown at the end of the week is also raising the specter of bigger risks as the reinstatement of the debt ceiling approaches in early March.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moody’s Investors Service analysts have warned that shutdown 2.0 could have a “more severe impact” on U.S. output. And if it were to extend beyond the March 1 end of the suspension of the current cap on America’s statutory debt capacity, “it would complicate negotiations over the debt ceiling.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Last month, Fitch Ratings’ global head of sovereign ratings, <strong>James McCormack,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-is-turning-america-into-another-bankrupt-casino\">warned</a> that the country’s mounting debt is weighing on the U.S., and the inability to deal with “meaningful fiscal deterioration” with a shut government could put our triple-A rating at risk. (A credit downgrade&#8212;which has only happened once since 1941&#8212;would make it harder for the U.S. government to borrow money and increase borrowing costs.)</p>\n<p><strong>Area man doesn’t understand why Democrats get themselves so wound up over investigations, fascism, the law, etc.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094964052558823424\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094964052558823424\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094964052558823424</a></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>Morgan Stanley, in Its Biggest Deal Since Crisis, Courts Future Millionaires (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-in-its-biggest-deal-since-crisis-courts-future-millionaires-11549885394\"><em>W.S.J.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Kamala Harris calls for marijuana legalization: ‘I think it gives a lot of people joy’ (<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/11/kamala-harris-2020-marijuana-legalization-1163795\">Politico</a>)</p>\n<p>She Spoke Up About Sexual Harassment At Ernst &amp; Young And Got Caught In A Web of Retaliation (<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ernst-and-young-sexual-harassment-karen-ward_us_5c14080ee4b009b8aea73086\">HuffPost</a>)</p>\n<p>Millions of Americans could be stunned as their tax refunds shrink (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/02/10/millions-americans-could-be-stunned-their-tax-refunds-shrink/\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>)</p>\n<p>The Next Wave of ‘Unicorn’ Start-Ups (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/technology/new-wave-unicorn-start-ups.html\"><em>N.Y.T.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Grading the impact of Trump’s China tariffs (<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-tariffs-china-trade-war-impact-8dd42cf5-983a-4eb9-a111-16132eeef1f8.html\">Axios</a>)</p>\n<p>Fyre Fest founder ordered to pay $2.9M to investment company (<a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/02/08/fyre-fest-founder-ordered-to-pay-2-9m-to-investment-company/\"><em>N.Y.P.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Cows Get Own Tinder-Style App for Breeding (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-10/cows-get-tinder-app-as-u-k-breeders-seek-moo-love-for-herds\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>Does Your Company Need to Know Your Body-Mass Index?

this was a boxing match, the referee would have stopped it,” Romney’s campaign spokesman, Eric Fehrnstrom, gleefully declared in the spin room after the first Romney-Obama debate in October 2012. Obama had appeared tired, irritated, on the defensive. <em>The New York Times</em> noted his “flat, uninspired” performance. Even diehard Obama fan Andrew Sullivan tweeted, “He’s boring, abstract, and”&#8212;cue the ultimate zinger&#8212;“less human-seeming than Romney.” But it was James Carville who finally put a finger on it: “It looked like President Obama didn’t really want to be there!”\n<p>The first Romney debate was a significant waypoint in Obama’s slow drift from ebullient optimist to cranky, deflated cynic, sparking speculation that he might just be over being president. Republicans from Chris Christie (“I don’t think he likes being president”) to Donald Trump (“He’s just not into it”) made note. So did the liberal media, perhaps feeling betrayed by the vanishing act of their heretofore cheerleader in chief. Salon asked in a headline, “Does Obama just hate his job?” *Harper’*s Kevin Baker reminded readers, “Barack Obama has repeatedly informed us that he hates living in the White House and can’t wait to be an ex-president.”</p>\n<p>But Obama, an indefatigable basketball fan, soon turned it around and flashed his competitive side. He roundly beat Romney in the second and third debates, before soaring through November and concluding one of the most quietly accomplished portfolios of any president in the modern era: auto-industry bailout, Wall Street reforms, new fuel-efficiency standards, increased aid to veterans, expanded F.D.A. food-safety oversight, gay marriage, getting private lenders out of the federal student-loan program, the Iran deal, and of course, the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare. Not to mention ending the war in Iraq and drawing down our presence in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>So what’s next for the Obamas? “All the strands of my life came together, and I really became a man when I moved to Chicago,” Obama said in May 2015, announcing Chicago as the future home of his presidential library and leading to speculation that the departing First Family will resettle in the Windy City. Others had predicted Hawaii, Obama’s home state, as nice a place as any to unwind. Finally, in March, Obama put an end to the guessing game: the family will remain in Washington at least until youngest daughter Sasha graduates from high school in 2019. Wherever they end up, Obama will be hitting the phones: he’s raised just $5.4 million of the projected $1 billion cost of his 21st-century “digital-first” library and its endowment.</p>\n<p>And what of the first lady’s post&#8211;White House plans? Despite media speculation about a possible future in politics, “There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Michelle is not running for president,” Barack recently declared. Wherever they are, the windows are likely to be open. “We can’t do little things like open the windows,” the First Lady told Ellen Degeneres about life in the “prison-like” White House. “I haven’t been in a car with the window open for, like, seven years.”</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/25/5745d3d44f6c70a31f0528ea_hive-contributor-profile-barack-obama.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 25, 2016 12:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Lauren Jones","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-barack-obama.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-barack-obama.jpg","credit":"By Alex Wong/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5745d3d455f979a31fa989e9","createdAt":"May 25, 2016 12:33 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 25, 2016 12:43 pm","description":"Getty: 504677512","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/barack-obama","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/25/5745d3d44f6c70a31f0528ea_hive-contributor-profile-barack-obama.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 25, 2016 12:43 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Lauren Jones","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-barack-obama.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-barack-obama.jpg","credit":"By Alex Wong/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5745d3d455f979a31fa989e9","createdAt":"May 25, 2016 12:33 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 25, 2016 12:43 pm","description":"Getty: 504677512","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"5744a8bbc1f81aa45c811812","revision":5,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/barack-obama"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Hope vs. Change: Why Some Democrats Are Turning on Obama’s Legacy","promoHed":"Hope vs. Change: Why Some Democrats Are Turning on Obama’s Legacy","dek":"Obama was a visionary who gave us the Affordable Care Act, DACA, and the Paris deal, but many of the country’s most ominous trends also proceeded apace under his watch.

As the public’s attention starts to focus on the primaries of 2020&#8212;<em>God, didn’t we just do this?</em>&#8212;many Democrats are acting as if <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> who’s having a good day when his approval ratings stay in the 40s, would beat most of the field. Maybe that’s because they’re still recovering from the shock of 2016. But maybe it’s more serious than that. If today’s Democrats can’t beat Trump, then maybe <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> wasn’t as bad a candidate as her critics claimed. And if Clinton wasn’t the problem, then what was the problem? Such questions are behind a recent spike of debates on the left over <strong>Barack Obama’s</strong> record. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/1078689102797492229\">More</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeGrunwald/status/1078686964566712321\">more</a> voices seem to be saying, either obliquely or bluntly, that Obama was a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1080265059576745986\">bad president</a>.</p>\n<p>Certainly, almost anyone on the left will agree that Obama was preferable to his Republican opponents. If they object to how Obama handled issues such as health care, finance capitalism, immigration, economic stimulus, trade, or war and peace, it’s not because they feel a Republican president would have been better. That makes it tempting to say that Obama is being criticized only for pushing insufficiently to the left, settling for the Affordable Care Act rather than Medicare for All or a stimulus package under a trillion dollars rather than one twice that size. But such an explanation tends to assume a difference of degree rather than kind, with Obama dwelling in a more purplish spot than his bluer critics. In reality, the categories that matter as much as left and right are those of establishment and radical. Obama’s record of siding reliably with the former at a time when the zeitgeist had come to favor the latter is the source of much of the tension over his legacy.</p>\n<p>The categories of establishment and radical are tricky to define, except to say that the former wishes to preserve much of the status quo, while the latter seeks more fundamental change. If one side is full of people with opinions on how to set the dials, the other is full of people who say we need a new instrumental panel. This creates interesting alliances of left and right, ones that are less a union of extremes&#8212;a product of what political scientists call “horseshoe theory”&#8212;and more a union of dissent. A radical is <em>not</em> an extremist, necessarily. It’s someone who believes the fundamentals are flawed.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Many of the disputes between today’s establishment and its radicals are merely continuations of where we were about 25 years ago. When <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> intervened in the war over Kosovo, in 1999, the establishment center supported him, while the outer bands of right and left opposed it. Similarly, trade agreements such as NAFTA in 1993 and GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) in 1994, passed on the strength of a broad center, while Democrats and Republicans on the edges voted no. On immigration, the center took a high-influx view while the disruptors took a more restrictive one. On business policy, the establishment center supported things like the Export-Import Bank of the United States, while the left and right radicals deplored it as a special interest or, as a candidate named Barack Obama would one day put it, corporate welfare.</p>\n<p>Several factors reduced the urgency of these divisions for about a decade. One was blistering economic growth in the late 1990s. Another was a reasonably harmonious world. Then came 9/11, which reshuffled everything but also caused the right (with plucky exceptions such as <strong>Ron Paul</strong> and the founders of <em>The American Conservative</em>) to put aside internal disputes and, for the most part, fall in line behind <strong>George W. Bush.</strong> After the failures of Iraq and other Bush policies, though, the divisions roared back to life. If there was a crystallizing moment, it was when Wall Street as we knew it was about to collapse. In the eyes of the establishment, left and right, an unforeseeable real-estate crash had threatened the survival of the country’s vibrant financial sector and, with it, the wallets and neighborhood A.T.M.s of every American. In the eyes of the radicals, our financial sector was an out-of-control predator built on a rotten edifice that was finally about to crumble. Its collapse wasn’t the threat; it was the cure. For the first time in years, an immense policy question was breaking out not between parties but within them. Among both Democrats and Republicans, an establishment wing was supporting the bailouts, while the radical wing was opposing them.</p>\n<p>This was Obama’s moment of truth, and it happened months before he was elected. Would presidential candidate Barack Obama side with the radicals? Much of his campaign rhetoric suggested he would. Or would he side with the establishment? Again, much of his campaign rhetoric suggested he would. We all know how he chose, and people will long debate whether it was right or wrong. Siding with the establishment certainly earned him plenty of defenders, and it was the safer choice. But it also came at great cost. Only <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/only-one-top-banker-jail-financial-crisis.html\">one Wall Street executive</a> ever went to prison for his part in the financial crisis. For millions of Americans, any residual trust in the competence and integrity of the ruling class was lost, and Obama had become part of the problem.</p>\n<p>From that point on, it was predictable that Obama, when forced to choose, would side with the establishment. Those who knew best told him to send a surge of troops to Afghanistan, so he did it. They told him to keep the records of detainee abuse under Bush concealed, so he hid them. They said that nationalizing the banks or prosecuting the executives would be too risky, so he avoided it. They said that our trade agreements enriched the nation, so he promoted them. They called him callous when he originally refused to intervene in Libya, so he toppled its leader.</p>\n<p>Many of these positions, welcome as they were within the Beltway, were out of sync with the mood of the country. In the 1990s, the radicals had been on the fringes, but that was no longer the case after 2008. An anti-war and anti-corporatist message sent Ron Paul riding surprisingly high in 2012, and a filibuster by <strong>Rand Paul</strong> in 2015 over the issue of drone strikes prompted even Democrats to deploy the #StandWithRand hashtag. Tea Party Republicans began to team up with Democratic union members to oppose Obama’s trade deals. Fury over the bank bailouts made its way into the congressional campaigns of Republicans and Democrats alike.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Where does this leave us, and what does it portend for Democrats in 2020? On the one hand, it’s unfair to call Barack Obama an establishment president, with all the status-quo overtones of the term. He gave us the Affordable Care Act, the stimulus, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform, an executive action for Dreamers, the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” a nuclear deal with Iran, diplomatic relations with Cuba, a climate deal in Paris, a New START treaty, a reform of student-loan programs, and two liberal Supreme Court appointments. On the other hand, many of the country’s most ominous trends proceeded apace under his watch. The financialization of the economy kept increasing. Student debt kept exploding. Trade policy kept its same priorities. Opioid addiction kept spreading. Suicide numbers kept rising. Disparities in life expectancy between rich and poor kept widening. Union membership kept declining. Illegal border-crossers kept coming. Our defense commitments kept growing. In towns like Jasper, Indiana, and Mebane, North Carolina, factory workers&#8212;a hundred here, a couple of hundred there&#8212;kept losing their middle-class jobs, outcompeted by giant Chinese mills with appalling conditions.</p>\n<p>The concise and indispensable new book <em>The Nationalist Revival,</em> by the left-leaning <strong>John B. Judis,</strong> contains one especially haunting statistic: 3.4 million jobs lost to the growth of trade with China since 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organization. For many of these forgotten Americans, Obama’s final State of the Union address lauding a manufacturing surge rang hollow, and so did his vision of making “change work for us, always extending America’s promise outward, to the next frontier, to more people.” They had already heard, many times, that “they may have to retool, they may have to re-train.” It was Bill Clinton, still a canny reader of the public, at times, who had to observe that “millions of people look at that pretty picture of America he painted and they cannot find themselves in it.”</p>\n<p>Radicalism deferred was radicalism intensified. Donald Trump is failing in countless ways, but he is, if nothing else, a radical&#8212;so much so that telling him he can’t do something makes him likelier to do it. Elizabeth Warren is betting that voters will see her as a radical, even though she’ll have to embrace Obama’s record along with her own. Joe Biden is betting that Americans are done with Trump’s experiment and wish to return to the establishment. Other Democrats, such as <strong>Cory Booker</strong> and <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> and <strong>Beto O’Rourke,</strong> seem to be betting on a bit of both&#8212;establishment-friendly economics and radical-friendly social views&#8212;assisted by charisma, youth, and identity. Each bet could win or lose, because Trump is a wild card. Still, while revolution must give way to a new establishment eventually, the mood doesn’t seem to favor it yet, and our shifts are still ongoing. (Just look at <strong>Tucker Carlson’s</strong> recent <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-mitt-romney-supports-the-status-quo-but-for-everyone-else-its-infuriating\">monologue</a> attacking our ruling class and its quest to “make the world safe for banking.” Much of it could have been delivered by <strong>Bernie Sanders.</strong>) You could say Obama spent eight years deferring a radical disruption. His tragedy is that he could have led it.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Democrats","socialTitle":"Hope vs. Change: Why Some Democrats Are Turning on Obama’s Legacy","socialDescription":"Obama was a visionary who gave us the Affordable Care Act, DACA, and the Paris deal, but many of the country’s most ominous trends also proceeded apace under his watch.

prepares to bid 2018 farewell, <strong>Barack Obama</strong> has once again joined in a favorite Internet tradition, holding strong opinions about his favorite books, songs, and movies of the year. (Former presidents&#8212;they’re just like us!) As Obama explained in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/barackobama/posts/10156393283416749\">Facebook post</a>, the ritual of making a list is a favorite of his, as it affords him a moment to reflect on some of his favorite art. He added, in a subtle post-presidential flex, “It also gives me a chance to highlight talented authors, artists, and storytellers&#8212;some who are household names and others who you may not have heard of before.” Overall, Obama’s taste is quintessentially “cool dad”&#8212;it’s rife with picks that run the gamut of style and aesthetic, with a few well-chosen surprises peppered throughout. The author of his top book of the year, however, is adorably obvious.</p>\n<p>His book list was divided into books by authors who have appeared on earlier lists and those by his new favorites. At the top, of course, was <strong>Michelle Obama’s</strong> <em>Becoming</em>&#8212;with the parenthetical note, “obviously my favorite!” Other picks included literary fiction and nonfiction, such as <strong>Tayari Jones’s</strong> <em>An American Marriage</em>&#8212;an Oprah’s Book Club 2018 selection as well&#8212;<em>Futureface: A Family Mystery, an Epic Quest, and the Secret to Belonging</em> by <strong>Alex Wagner,</strong> <em>Warlight</em> by <strong>Michael Ondaatje,</strong> <em>Feel Free</em> by <strong>Zadie Smith,</strong> and <em>Florida</em> by <strong>Lauren Groff.</strong> (Notably, Groff’s <em>Fates and Furies</em> also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/10/obama-favourite-book-of-2015-lauren-groff-fates-and-furies\">topped</a> Obama’s 2015 list.) He also included some of the nonfiction that intrigued political commentators like <strong>David Brooks</strong> and <strong>Ezra Klein</strong> this year: <em>Factfulness</em> by <strong>Hans Rosling,</strong> <em>How Democracies Die</em> by <strong>Steven Levitsky</strong> and <strong>Daniel Ziblatt,</strong> and <em>Why Liberalism Failed</em> by <strong>Patrick Deneen.</strong></p>\n<p>Obama’s film picks for the year are an equally versatile blend of blockbusters and indie projects: <em>Annihilation</em>, <em>Black Panther</em>, <em>BlacKkKlansman</em>, <em>Blindspotting</em>, <em>Burning</em>, <em>The Death of Stalin</em>, <em>Eighth Grade</em>, <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em>, <em>Leave No Trace</em>, <em>Minding the Gap</em>, <em>The Rider</em>, <em>Roma</em>, <em>Shoplifters</em>, <em>Support the Girls</em>, and <em>Won’t You Be My Neighbor?</em> He declined to weigh in on whether or not he believes it’s essential to watch <em>Roma</em> in a movie theater, or if it’s O.K. to simply stream it at home. He left one of the most raucously funny films of 2018, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/02/game-night-rachel-mcadams-review\"><em>Game Night</em></a>, off his list&#8212;but something tells us the Internet and <strong>Jesse Plemons</strong> will forgive him.</p>\n<p>But it’s the music portion of the list that showcases Obama’s increasingly strong “cool dad” persona like a pair of sensible, relaxed-fit jeans. Yes, there are the more expected song picks for any music aficionado&#8212;including “Make Me Feel” from <strong>Janelle Monáe’s</strong> <em>Dirty Computer</em> and “Apeshit” by The Carters. Cardi B’s infectiously joyous “I Like It” and Courtney Barnett’s “Need a Little Time” also made the list. And then there’s “One Trick Ponies” by Kurt Vile, “Wait by the River” by Lord Huron, and “Nina Cried Power” by Hozier. “And in honor of one of the great jazz singers of all time, who died this year,” Obama wrote as he closed his list, “a classic album: <em>The Great American Songbook</em> by Nancy Wilson.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8211; Is this the end of <a

Less than one week after her victory in the midterm elections, after all, A.O.C. had joined environmental activists in a protest in Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi’s</strong> office. Later, on a call with the progressive group Justice Democrats, she encouraged activists to support an effort to primary Democratic House incumbents. Then, during the first week of the 116th Congress, Ocasio-Cortez dropkicked leadership by taking a stand against the House rules package. Many Democratic caucus-goers wondered if she was more interested in building a grassroots movement or establishing her own political brand than passing collaborative legislation. As one congressional aide to a progressive House Democrat characterized it to me, “a cloud” hovered over Ocasio-Cortez after the elections.</p>\n<p>Months later, however, much of that skepticism has dissipated. Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides I spoke with over the past week see A.O.C. as a charismatic young lawmaker eager to learn the ropes and build relationships. The progressive aide, who has had multiple interactions with the freshman lawmaker, described her as having “an incredible Obama-esque factor” when connecting with people but surprisingly lacking an ego. The first congressional aide echoed the sentiment. “She has a willingness to work with people and develop positive relationships, and I think we should let her do her job for a little while and wait to determine if she is going to be a flamethrower or someone who will do more and do something real,” this person told me. “I think there are other members that can be more of a pain than A.O.C.”</p>\n<p>Notably, some suggested, Ocasio-Cortez has accrued praise by handling herself admirably in the face of criticism, which has occasionally been laced with overt sexism&#8212;such as <em>Washington Examiner</em> reporter <strong>Eddie Scarry’s</strong> widely criticized tweet that her wardrobe betrayed her socialist street cred. (“I think a lot of members think that she is probably being treated unfairly,” another congressional aide told me.) Sources I spoke with said Democrats were also encouraged by comments from A.O.C. that suggested she was backing away from threats to primary more centrist colleagues. (“I’m focused on my job,” she <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/11/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-democrats-establisment-1093728\">told</a> Politico.) Moreover, others have been impressed by her swift mastery of procedure. Late last year, <strong>Elijah Cummings,</strong> chairman of the House Oversight Committee, specifically requested that A.O.C. be tapped to serve on said committee, hoping that she would ask the questions no one else was. “A lot of people said that she might not be a team player, and I have found it to be just the opposite,” he told me. “She has been a breath of fresh air.”</p>\n<p>Cummings acknowledged the disruptive nature of the new Congress; the freshman class will at times be at odds with other members of the Democratic caucus. Congresswoman <strong>Rashida Tlaib</strong> of Michigan launched a 24-hour news cycle when she declared she wanted to “impeach the motherfucker,” in reference to Trump. Tlaib and <strong>Ilhan Omar</strong> of Minnesota have also stoked controversy with their criticism of Israel&#8212;notably putting them at odds with some Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on which Omar sits. Just last week, Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib, Omar, and Congresswoman <strong>Ayanna Pressley,</strong> another freshman, signed a letter calling on the bipartisan conference committee negotiating a border security deal to cut, not increase, funding for the Department of Homeland Security and, specifically, the ICE and C.P.B. agencies&#8212;a move certain to complicate the negotiation effort.</p>\n<p>But Cummings suggested that disagreement within the ranks is a considerable strength. “It is important that you have people like her&#8212;not only on my committee, but in the Congress&#8212;to remind folks of who we are, who we are as the Democratic Party, and who we have been for many years,” he explained. “And so, sure, when you do that like Ms. Cortez, you may ruffle a few feathers, but I think that, in the end, it will make us a better and stronger party.”</p>\n<p>Last week, during a House Oversight Committee hearing on the cost of prescription drugs, the freshman congresswoman presented as measured and methodical as she probed the relationship between drug manufacturers and taxpayer-backed organizations like the National Institutes of Health. “She asked the best set of questions of anybody in her five minutes,” Cummings said, noting that the New York congresswoman stayed for the entire hearing, which stretched beyond the five-hour mark. “It was clear that she had done her homework.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>After years of Republican infighting on Capitol Hill, Trump allies have seized on this new, disruptive era in progressive politics as evidence that the Democratic Party, too, is in disarray. Right-wing media has eagerly latched on to these policy divisions, casting A.O.C. as the ringleader of a band of insurgents. Democrats I spoke with, however, argued that there have always been progressives and centrists under the party banner. Others pointed to the unified messaging around the shutdown as evidence that these tensions were overblown. “Maybe right-wing media is so sick of their Freedom Caucus thwarting everything they want to do that they finally want to create that sentiment here. I just don’t think it is going to happen,” the first congressional aide told me.</p>\n<p>The freshman class is under no delusion that there is a one-size-fits-all approach to promoting progressive policy. “Every member of the freshman class has their own politics and their own experience,” an aide to a freshman lawmaker told me. But, they added, “there is tremendous kinship and excitement about this class. I honestly don’t give too much credence to the narrative around divisions.”</p>\n<p>Underlying the various narratives surrounding A.O.C. and other members of the Democratic freshman class is a recognition of their power. <strong>Steve Doocy,</strong> <strong>Ainsley Earhardt,</strong> and <strong>Brian Kilmeade</strong> wouldn’t waste airtime attacking her, Tlaib, and Omar if they didn’t recognize that these women are threats to the ideology they seek to promote every morning. It is not unlike how the Republican Party has spent billions of dollars disparaging Pelosi, whose skills as a master legislator were on full display during the shutdown. (Two sources suggested to me that Pelosi likely sees herself in Ocasio-Cortez.)</p>\n<p>A.O.C. and her fellow progressives have already had an indelible impact on the national political discourse, despite only being in office a few weeks. Since Ocasio-Cortez floated a 70 percent marginal tax rate on income over $10 million during a <em>60 Minutes</em> interview, the proposal has emerged as a talking point for potential 2020 hopefuls. According to one recent poll, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/425422-a-majority-of-americans-support-raising-the-top-tax-rate-to-70\">59 percent</a> of registered American voters support the plan&#8212;including 45 percent of Republicans. Similarly, while A.O.C.’s bold yet publicly undefined Green New Deal initially drew criticism and caused some turmoil within the Democratic Party, it has quickly emerged as something of a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-green-new-deal-a-green-new-deal-whatever-it-is-2020-democrats-support-it/2019/01/30/a75166d4-2340-11e9-ad53-824486280311_story.html\">progressive litmus test</a> for the Democratic field. “She is a Democrat and she is a strong, vocal advocate for our agenda,” the third congressional aide told me. “I think while initially fearful&#8212;and maybe even right to be fearful because of some of the early things that were going on&#8212;she has now come into her own and realized that she has a lot of power.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"House Democrats","socialTitle":"How A.O.C.

But Biden has other ideas.","body":"<p>Word of <strong>Barack Obama’s</strong> mid-November meeting with <strong>Beto O’Rourke</strong> cheered the millions of O’Rourke fans who want the Texas congressman to run for president in 2020. And it delighted the political pundit-verse, which is always hungry for new gossip and intrigue. <strong>Joe Biden,</strong> however, is said to have been less than thrilled. Obamaworld insiders describe the former vice president as upset&#8212;not specifically by Obama’s conversation with O’Rourke, but by the former president’s willingness to talk to other plausible Democratic contenders while Biden is still deciding whether to run himself. “This is unequivocally false. Period,” Biden spokesman <strong>Bill Russo says.</strong> So just how does Biden feel about his ex-boss chatting with potential primary rivals? “I’m not going to comment further,” Russo replies.</p>\n<p>Obama has nothing against Biden&#8212;in fact, he still loves Amtrak Joe, according to a person familiar with the ex-president’s thinking. And Obama has been strict about not publicizing who has sounded him out. But he does not want to repeat what he considers a mistake from 2016, when the Democratic establishment wrapped its arms around <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> as the party’s nominee early in the process. “He contrasts that with 2008, when he came out of the primaries and he’d been to all 50 states and he was fucking ready to take on John McCain,” one former Obama advisor says. “So his position this time is, ‘If you’re serious and you want to talk, I’ll talk to you.’ As things unfold, he might say, ‘Let’s all stay focused.’ But he’s not going to pick a winner.”</p>\n<p>Obama’s current wide-open approach must feel painfully ironic to Biden: four years ago he was one of the prospective candidates being pressured to stand down in favor of Clinton. In August, 2015, not long after the death of Biden’s 46-year-old son, Beau, and with talk escalating that Biden might jump into the race, Obama’s longtime senior political advisor, <strong>David Axelrod,</strong> went on the <em>Today</em> show to say he would advise against a Biden run. “I know what it takes to put a presidential campaign together, and it is late in the game,” Axelrod said, sending an unmistakable message. “Secretary Clinton, for all her problems, some of them self-inflicted, still has a very high rating among Democrats, and that of course is what determines who the nominee will be, and a big head start.” Now a CNN poll of Iowa shows Biden far ahead of second place <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong>&#8212;yet Biden isn’t being given the same deference.</p>\n<p>“If the institutional players had limited their time and advice to a couple of handpicked candidates in 2006 and 2007, Obama wouldn’t have had an opportunity to move forward,” says <strong>John Del Cecato,</strong> a Democratic strategist who began advising then-Illinois state senator Obama in 2004, and who worked on both of Obama’s successful presidential campaigns. “I know President Obama has tremendous respect for Biden. But he also appreciates the dark-horse candidates, or those who haven’t been as plugged in.” Obama’s experience also shapes his view that a long haul of contested primaries ultimately produces a sharper general election candidate. “When we lost New Hampshire in 2008 and we were all so depressed, Obama was very zen about the whole thing,” Del Cecato says. “Not that he wanted to be set back on his heels, but it’s one thing to have campaigned successfully in a couple of places. He thinks the nomination is something that should be earned.”</p>\n<p>Biden is 76, and he has been a national political figure since 1973. With the party’s momentum moving toward younger, non-white, female, more liberal candidates, one top Democratic strategist believes Biden is actually better off with Obama talking to other presidential aspirants now. “If I were Biden, I wouldn’t want to be in a situation where Obama is saying, ‘Look, you’ve got to be for my VP.’ Democrats don’t like to be told who to vote for,” the consultant says. “Many people lined up behind Sanders in 2016 because they didn’t want to be told to support Hillary. Biden doesn’t want to fall into that trap, to have Obama embrace him too exclusively, too early.”</p>\n<p>A second strategist, who works for a likely Democratic contender, understands why Obama’s flirtations may sting Biden’s ego. But this strategist doesn’t believe the former president will end up having much real influence on who emerges from the crowded 2020 field. “If Obama is playing footsie with people now, it creates tension,” the advisor says. “And it gets you some media attention and maybe some staffing. But actual voters? Obama himself has always been popular with Democrats, but I’ve never seen his popularity be transferrable to someone else.” Don’t kid yourself, though: Biden, and all the others, would love any wink, nod, or blessing Obama might bestow.</p>","rubric":"2020","socialTitle":"Obama Has Flirted with Beto, and Biden Is Not Happy","socialDescription":"The former president wants to avoid the mistakes of 2016, when the field was cleared for Hillary.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, representatives for the Bush family and <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> have denied the allegation.</p>\n<p>“This should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me, and they all know it,” Trump said. “Some of them have told me that we should have done it.”</p>\n<p>Clinton spokesperson <strong>Angel Ureña</strong> explicitly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/04/trump-former-presidents-border-wall-1082562\">refuted</a> the president’s assertion, adding that the two men have “not talked since the inauguration.” Bush representative <strong>Freddy Ford</strong> said the wall has never been discussed between the two. Former president George H.W. Bush <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/george-hw-bush-dead-at-94\">died in November</a>, though it is seen as unlikely that he and Trump had any significant discussion of a wall.

An Obama spokesperson reportedly declined comment, though Obama himself has come out against the wall on numerous occasions.

All four major broadcast networks, as well as Fox News, Fox Business, MSNBC, PBS, and CNN, will air the address&#8212;which, in some cases, will involve bumping programming. <em>Black-ish, The Gifted, FBI, Splitting Up Together,</em> and <em>Ellen’s Game of Games</em> will <a href=\"https://www.tvguide.com/news/president-trump-address-tuesday-fbi-blackish/\">all have to wait</a> for the president to finish his speech, in which he will likely stoke immigration fears with racist rhetoric and false or misleading statements.</p>\n<p>Trump announced the speech on Twitter Monday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1082347305699889157\">writing</a>, “I am pleased to inform you that I will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border.” The speech will begin at 9 P.M., and Trump is also expected to travel to the border on Thursday. CBS told <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/424258-democrats-demand-air-time-to-counter-trumps-border-speech\"><em>The Hill</em></a> that the White House said the speech would last a maximum of eight minutes.</p>\n<p>For a few hours on Monday, networks <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/07/media/networks-trump-border-security-speech/index.html\">wrung their hands</a> over whether to air the speech&#8212;but before long, CBS acquiesced to the president’s request, with the rest soon following suit. Critics have already slammed the networks for caving to Trump, worrying that viewers could walk away from his speech believing untrue statements&#8212;and sullying an immigration debate that’s already been poisoned by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/07/trump-administrations-misleading-spin-immigration-crime-terrorism/\">lies, exaggerations, and false narratives</a>. As <strong>Mika Brzezinski</strong> <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/morning-joe-says-networks-should-not-broadcast-trump-primetime-address-stream-of-lies/\">put it</a> on Tuesday’s <em>Morning Joe,</em> “The networks should refuse to turn over the airwaves to Donald Trump tonight for what they know objectively to be a steady stream of lies. Maybe that will stop him from debasing yet another one of our historic, solemn, and cherished presidential traditions.”</p>\n<p>Many more are grating at the apparent hypocrisy inherent in the networks’ decision to run the speech in the first place. As <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/7/18172419/trump-immigration-speech-networks-obama\">Vox</a> notes, <strong>George W. Bush</strong> was given airtime for his own immigration speech in 2006&#8212;but when <strong>Barack Obama</strong> planned to give his own speech on the same subject in 2014, the major broadcast networks chose not to air it. Obama pointed out that Bush’s speech had aired; networks countered that it had been a bipartisan address, while Obama’s intended address&#8212;which announced a series of executive actions on immigration&#8212;was “an overtly political move by the White House,” as Politico’s Playbook wrote at the time. Ultimately, big broadcast networks did not air it. As Vox points out, Trump’s speech is certain to be “overtly political” as well.</p>\n<p>So, why give Trump this platform? Perhaps it’s because, as CNN’s <strong>Brian Stelter</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/07/media/networks-trump-border-security-speech/index.html\">noted Monday</a>, Obama never made a formal request for airtime&#8212;but Trump reportedly did.</p>\n<p>“When the president of the United States asks for airtime, you’ve got to do it,” veteran anchor <strong>Ted Koppel</strong> told <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/trump-address-border-visit.html\"><em>The New York Times,</em></a> adding that he believes the networks should give Trump the benefit of the doubt. “If what he has to say is clearly just in his self-interest and does not address the greater national interest, then the next time the White House comes around, I might not be inclined to offer it.”</p>\n<p>In response to Trump’s announcement, House Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> and Senate Minority Leader <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> issued a joint statement in which they argued for equal time to respond to the president’s speech, writing, “Now that the television networks have decided to air the President’s address, which if his past statements are any indication will be full of malice and misinformation, Democrats must immediately be given equal airtime.” But as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/01/08/this-president-lies-daily-critics-demand-networks-fact-check-trumps-live-immigration-speech/\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> points out, the fairness doctrine was repealed in 1987&#8212;meaning it’s up to networks themselves to decide whether to grant Democrats time to respond on air. According to <em>The Hill,</em> Fox News, Fox Business, NBC, CBS, ABC, and CNN all intend to do so.</p>\n<p><em>This post has been updated.</em></p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Don’t call it a Dernaissance, call it <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/laura-dern-cover-story?inline\">Laura Dern’s much-deserved close-up</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Ethan Hawke gets candid about the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/ethan-hawke-kevin-spacey-harvey-weinstein-little-gold-men-interview?inline\">Weinsteins and Spaceys of the world</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; “I have a little bit of control over my destiny” <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/nicole-kidman-destroyer-big-little-lies?inline\">&#8212;Nicole Kidman</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Harrowing tales from the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/st-barths-yacht-season-pippa-middleton-jared-leto-les-moonves?inline\">St. Barth’s Yacht Convention</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The year ahead in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/the-year-ahead-in-royals-2019?inline\">British royalty</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hollywood newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Trump Broadcast","socialTitle":"Networks Will Air Trump’s Surely Inflammatory Immigration Speech . . .

href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/12/michelle-obama-book-tour-at-barclays-center\">follow-up visit</a> for her national book tour. Speaking with <strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong> onstage, Obama seemingly took inspiration from the stylish star and seriously stepped up her shoe game, wearing a pair of glittery thigh-high, $4,000 <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6514751/Michelle-Obama-dresses-impress-4-000-glittery-thigh-high-Balenciaga-boots-yellow-gown.html\">Balenciaga boots</a> paired with a yellow Balenciaga wrap dress.</p>\n<p>Obama has always been careful about her fashion choices, from these Balenciaga boots to the sensible J. Crew cardigans she often wore as First Lady. “I did know that my clothes were making a statement, I knew that was the case,” she told Parker on Wednesday, reflecting on her time in the White House. “So we decided why don’t we use this platform to uplift some young new designers who normally wouldn’t get this kind of attention, because you can change their lives, which is one of the reasons why we <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/01/michelle-obama-jason-wu-inauguration-dress\">chose Jason Wu</a> for my inaugural gown.”</p>\n<p>Though she has been gone from the White House for nearly two years, Obama is still very much in the spotlight, even sometimes unintentionally sharing it with <strong>Melania Trump.</strong> Last week, she visited Children’s Hospital Colorado on the same day that Trump visited Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C.; naturally, their two visits, where they both read to and visited children, were compared in news coverage. While Trump’s recent <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/melania-trump-says-she-does-what-i-think-is-right-despite-facing-criticism-from-the-public-media\">Fox News interview</a> followed her around the day of the hospital visit, Obama’s day was celebrated as if she had never left the White House at all. And that was nothing compared to the fervor that met <strong>Barack Obama</strong> when he made his <a

But they desperately fear another Barack Obama.","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Don’t kid yourself: President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> could absolutely win re-election. The old man is preternaturally intuitive, resilient when most would wilt, and just plain lucky. Plus, just as Ferris Bueller drove Ed Rooney insane, Trump has a knack for goading his political opponents to self-destruct. But, as I like to caution Republicans, you never know what might happen in 2020 if the Democratic Party nominates a presidential candidate who is likable, trustworthy, and . . . not under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>\n<p>Perhaps that is why, as Republicans sift through the wreckage of another Trump meltdown, the demolition of their House majority in the midterm elections two months prior, the ouster of <strong>James Mattis,</strong> and a holiday shutdown over the border wall, party operatives were spending the most wonderful time of the year trying to figure out what it’s going to take to avoid an even worse fate. For as much as some Republicans would like to see the president return to Trump Tower, they’re not willing to give up the presidency. And so, as the 2020 primary season begins, they are beginning to make a list of Democratic candidates that they think Trump can credibly beat.</p>\n<p>Without naming names, I asked several senior Republican insiders which Democrat, or Democrats, at the top of the opposition ticket would most reassure them about 2020. Without exception, <strong>Elizabeth Warren,</strong> the 69-year-old progressive senator from Massachusetts, topped every wish list. “There’s a lot of <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> in her,” said a veteran Republican operative in D.C. who hails from the Midwest and keeps a close eye on the heartland. “She’s elitist and doesn’t appear very nimble. It would be hard for her to expand her base or reach directly into Trump’s base.” Close behind were Senators <strong>Cory Booker</strong> of New Jersey and <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> of Vermont, who, technically, is not a member of the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>There’s a theme here. For all of Trump’s faults&#8212;and Republicans who make a living trying to win elections tend to be honest about most of them, albeit privately&#8212;the United States is still a center-right country, at least according to the data the G.O.P. trusts. And Trump brings a certain gravitas to the job, despite his periodic tendency to diminish the presidency. A lightweight Democratic contender too enthralled with, or captive to, leftist dogma is an opponent that even a politically pockmarked Trump can exploit.</p>\n<p>To wit, Trump’s domestic populism, fraught with cultural nativism such as it is, looks far more reasonable when stacked against dubious promises of free stuff (actually financed by the taxpayers, so, not free.) Trump’s “America First” nationalism, fraught with a troubling pullback from the post&#8211;World War II, bipartisan foreign policy consensus and disregard for America’s unique role as global protector of the liberal world order such as it is, looks less drastic when stacked against . . . a Democrat who essentially wants to do the same thing, minus the military buildup&#8212;and the tweets.</p>\n<p>But more than all of that, Republicans are happy to run against any progressive who tries to compete with Trump on Trump’s terms. Exchanging barbs on social media platforms; name-calling; questioning his capacity mentally, physically, and the like. As much as the Democratic base might be clamoring for a standard bearer to force-feed the president a dose of his own medicine, there is no beating the genuine article at the game he perfected. Trump is too quick and too shameless, and that approach offers little change to voters who want to turn the page from the chaos and anxiety that has characterized the current era. “A Democrat is not going to defeat Trump by being more brash, blustering, and strident. They will win over voters they need to retake the ‘blue wall’ states by connecting with those voters on substance but presenting an alternative to his leadership style,” a Republican consultant told me in an e-mail.</p>\n<p>Indeed, if there’s a key aspect to the fear <strong>Beto O’Rourke</strong> inspires in some Republicans, it’s the outgoing Texas congressman’s combination of sunny disposition and 21st-century social media agility. Sure, he’s unabashedly progressive, but to borrow a phrase from Vice President <strong>Mike Pence</strong>: He’s not angry about it. Nor, as it happens, does O’Rourke look down upon so-called heretics, or, if you prefer, “deplorables.”</p>\n<p>Ignore the Beto mockery prevalent in Republican circles during O’Rourke’s near upset of Senator <strong>Ted Cruz</strong> this past November. Party insiders were taking notes, and taking the 46-year-old from El Paso far more seriously than suggested by the apparent delight they took in lampooning everything about a figure who has drawn comparisons to a onetime up-and-coming Democrat named of <strong>Barack Obama.</strong> “A Democrat who can carry Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, or North Carolina is problematic,” a Republican insider from a critical swing state said. “Someone like Beto, who can campaign on the fly, raise money, and excite young voters, could put those and other states in play.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>The midterms marked a turning point in the Republican Party’s confidence in the president. During most of Trump’s time in the Oval, his job approval rating has been remarkably stable, poor but not disastrously so, averaging in the low 40s. Throughout, the president has skated from scandal to scandal, any one of which would have hobbled past administrations. As last month’s elections approached, this dynamic, reinforced by the stability of a Republican majority in the U.S. Senate that ultimately expanded by two seats, created a false sense of security about the health of the G.O.P. among many Republicans, even those less than thrilled with Trump.</p>\n<p>November 6 provoked a brutal reassessment. Republicans saw their coalition crack, and many senior strategists blame the president. As a few well-placed strategists told me for reporting I did for the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/house-republicans-clash-over-trumps-role-in-downfall-look-to-2020\"><em>Washington Examiner</em></a>, after-action polling and analysis made it clear that Trump drove away soft Republicans, college-educated Republicans, female Republicans, moderate Republicans, basically every category of Republican not firmly ensconced in Trump’s base, plus crucial independents, handing House Democrats a larger victory than most had predicted, and with it, the majority. The right Democratic presidential nominee could capitalize on that.</p>\n<p>And who is that? As often as Warren and her like-styled cohorts were mentioned as easy Trump foils, former Vice President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> was cited as among the few Democrats who many Republicans believe might dispatch the incumbent with relative ease. Is Biden progressive? Absolutely. Gaffe-prone? Duh. But he is the antithesis of Trump, with the added benefit that he’s been vetted before, and passed muster. “He wreaks calmness and normalcy, which I feel like people crave over the chaos of the Trump administration,” a Republican strategist headquartered in the Southwest said. Another Democrat who fits that bill, more than one Republican volunteered to me, unprompted: <strong>John Hickenlooper,</strong> the 66-year-old outgoing two-term governor of Colorado, former Denver mayor, and small-business owner. “One of the main disasters to avoid is to think 2016 is like 2020,” the Republican strategist based in the Southwest explained. “Trump got lucky and people held their nose against Clinton. That’s not likely to happen this time.”</p>\n<p>The problem for Republicans, lamented a seasoned G.O.P. hand in Washington, is that despite the challenges the Democrats face heading into the next election&#8212;a crowded and divisive primary and a restless base not necessarily uninterested in nominating calm, competent, and normal&#8212;“is that the Trump apologists won’t put the blame where it belongs and are burying their heads in the sand.”</p>\n<p>Of course, countless other Democrats are expected to run for president. Republicans continue to assess the developing field of candidates, many of who either remain an enigma or who engender differences of opinion as to how they would measure up against Trump. For instance, some dismiss Senator <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> of California as another radical progressive who isn’t ready for Prime Time, even if she’s right out of central casting for Democratic presidential contenders. Others see in her a shrewd operator who could realistically win the nomination and put Trump on defense the same way House Democrats put House Republicans in a bind in the midterm elections.</p>\n<p>It’s much the same for <strong>Michael Bloomberg,</strong> the billionaire media mogul and former mayor of New York City. Here’s a politician with a large enough personal fortune to outspend Trump and the Republican National Committee put together, and the wiliness to overcome his shortcomings. But some Republicans are unimpressed, saying there are few Democrats as polarizing and sure to keep the G.O.P. coalition together the way Clinton did two years ago as would the crusading anti-soda, anti-gun Bloomberg.</p>\n<p>Then there are those Republican power brokers who, amid fretting about what might happen down ticket in 2020, neither fear the formidable Democrats nor welcome the weaklings. “Fear is an interesting word because I fucking hate Trump so much,” a Republican consigliere said. “I certainly wouldn’t be sorry to see him lose.”</p>\n<p><em>David M.

He went full dragon energy <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/even-trumps-closest-republican-allies-cant-stomach-syria-decision\">in December</a> after Trump abruptly announced that he was withdrawing nearly all U.S. troops from the war-torn region (“If <strong>[Barack] Obama</strong> had done this, all of us would be going nuts because it’s such a bad idea,” he told <strong>Mike Pence</strong>), and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Emma_Dumain/status/1075760112508329987\">promised</a> to tweet at Trump every time the president mentioned Syria (“I’m not letting this go”). Unfortunately, recent events have forced Graham to take more dramatic action to get the president’s attention, such as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/20/inside-patrick-shanahans-clash-with-congress-munich-over-syria/?utm_term=.a91455067823\">describing in detail</a> to <em>The Washington Post</em> how he impressed upon Acting Defense Secretary <strong>Patrick Shanahan</strong> his fervent belief that withdrawing from Syria is “the dumbest f---ing idea” he’s ever heard.</p>\n<p>The dramatic scene reportedly unfolded last Saturday at the Munich Security Conference, where several members of the U.S. congressional delegation privately confronted Shanahan about the administration’s plans. A day earlier, Graham <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/02/15/exclusive-lindsey-graham-pitches-syria-safe-zone-to-prevent-isis-reemergence/\">told Breitbart</a>, he had personally pitched Trump on establishing a Syria “safe zone” along the border with Turkey, which would allow a percentage of U.S. troops to remain in the region as a deterrent against ISIS, joining forces with European and Kurdish allies to monitor the area. Apparently he figured he’d made inroads with the president. But when he heard about Shanahan suggesting to European allies that Trump is preparing to withdraw <em>all</em> U.S. troops from Syria, Graham exploded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Are you telling our allies that we are going to go to zero by April 30?” he asked Shanahan, according to Graham.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Yes, that’s been our direction [from the president],” Shanahan replied.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“That’s the dumbest f---ing idea I’ve ever heard,” Graham responded.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Graham then launched into a list of consequences he feared would result from a precipitous U.S. withdrawal from Syria without a follow-up plan: the Islamic State would return, Turkey would attack Kurdish forces, Iran would gain the advantage. Graham asked Shanahan if he disagreed with that analysis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“That could very well happen,” Shanahan said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Well, if the policy is going to be that we are leaving by April 30, I am now your adversary, not your friend,” Graham told the acting Pentagon chief, according to Graham. (Several other lawmakers confirmed this exchange.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After a “deer in the headlights” response, Shanahan reportedly pinned the dumb f---ing idea on his dumb boss. (Or, as the <em>Post</em> put it, “he failed to articulate a substantive response&#8212;other than to re-iterate these were Trump’s instructions.”) “Shanahan did not have a good meeting,” said Democratic Senator <strong>Sheldon Whitehouse.</strong> Fellow Democrat <strong>Bob Menendez</strong> fumed that the Trump administration was not listening to a bipartisan opposition. “[Shanahan] got a chorus of voices that basically said, ‘This is not going to work, there is a bipartisan resolve not to let this happen, and you need to send a message back to the president that there’s a combined, unified view this is not the way to go and he should change course,’” Menendez said. “[Shanahan] basically said he got the message.”</p>\n<p>Should the Shanahan intervention move the administration’s needle on Syria, perhaps persuading Trump to join a coalition of the willing to establish a safe zone, Graham would like it known that he had something to do with it. “After Iraq, not only would this be a mistake, this would be almost an unpardonable sin, in the sense that you know what can happen.

But the theatricality with which he tells it may be his greatest vulnerability.","body":"<p>One word pops up quickly and prominently nearly every time <strong>Cory Booker</strong> speaks publicly. “I will continue to try to be as fearlessly authentic as I can,” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/us/politics/cory-booker-2020.html\">he told <em>The New York Times</em></a> during a visit to New Hampshire in early December. “Every candidate should run on their authentic self,” Booker <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/news/cory-booker-presidency-single-man-20181214.html\">told the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em></a> later that month. A Booker ally uses the same word to describe the New Jersey senator to me: “His real, deep, authentic connection to the city of Newark informs a lot of what he’s done in D.C.”</p>\n<p><strong>Cornell Belcher</strong> laughs. The Democratic pollster believes the repetitive choice of adjective is no coincidence. “I think perhaps some of that’s been poll-tested or comes from focus groups,” he says. Which would only be due diligence, in preparation for Booker, 49, making his decision official in the next several weeks. The Booker team is certainly savvy enough to have picked up the whispering by some of his possible competitors for the 2020 presidential nomination, using a line of attack that’s been wielded against Booker for years: “I hate the word ‘authenticity,’” one rival strategist says. “But he seems so hammed up.”</p>\n<p>Booker’s first crucial test would come in South Carolina’s primary, where black voters make up the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/21/cory-booker-bernie-sanders-2020-south-carolina-1116639\">majority</a> of the Democratic electorate. Voters there are more socially conservative than black voters in many other states, and the most efficient way to connect with them is through churches. So Booker’s first 2019 trip to an early-primary state was to South Carolina, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, for an appearance at Zion Baptist Church in the state capital, Columbia. <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> was there too, but Booker was promoted as the main attraction. “<strong>Barack Obama’s</strong> ability to break through with African-American voters in 2008 wasn’t simply around issues,” says Belcher, who worked for that campaign. “It was also around values, and what he represented. Remember the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/16/us/politics/16obama.html\">fatherhood responsibility speech</a> that he did? A lot of the chattering class elites had a bit of a problem with it. You know who didn’t have a problem with it? Those churchgoing black women in South Carolina who, every Sunday, that’s a conversation in their churches.”</p>\n<p>Obama demolished <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> in South Carolina by a 29-point margin, generating momentum that propelled him into a strong Super Tuesday showing. The context for Booker will be very different&#8212;in part because President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> looms over everything, but also because the South Carolina Democratic primary has never before included two black contenders. He would be going up against his good friend from the Senate, <strong>Kamala Harris.</strong> His strengths include the breadth of his life experience&#8212;Booker was a star student and football player who studied at Stanford and Oxford and Yale, but continually worked with low-income kids and moved to a Newark housing project before successfully running to become that city’s mayor in 2006. Booker would be the first former Democratic mayor of a major city to run for president since Cleveland’s <strong>Dennis Kucinich</strong> in 2008, providing a powerful voice for urban issues at a time when big cities are underrepresented in the national political process and discussion. Booker still lives in hardscrabble Newark, a decision his camp says was never a stunt&#8212;that it gave him a genuine understanding of working-class issues when he was mayor, and that it would distinguish him from the rest of the field if he runs for president.</p>\n<p>Booker, never married, would lack one key element that helped Obama sell himself on a human level in South Carolina: an exemplary wife and kids. His greatest weakness, though, may be the theatricality with which he expresses his experiences and opinions, a style that can produce compelling rhetoric, but one that also opens him up to skepticism that his actions are indeed stunts. In September, during the <strong>Brett Kavanaugh</strong> confirmation hearings, Booker declared, “This is about the closest I’ll probably ever have in my life to an ‘I am Spartacus’ moment,” as he <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/405345-booker-releases-confidential-kavanaugh-documents\">released</a> supposedly confidential documents. Unfortunately for Booker, the documents had already been released the night before, and did not back up Booker’s claims about Kavanaugh and racial profiling. “People may view some of the things he does as flashy, but they are effective and genuine,” the Booker ally says. “He’s a product of two parents who were active in the civil-rights movement, and he’s been seeking creative ways to elevate the causes he believes in for a long time. He also talks about love and unity of purpose in politics in a way that distinguishes him from many Democrats.” No less an authority on black churches and political performance than the Reverend <strong>Al Sharpton</strong> vouches for Booker’s abilities. “I’ve seen Cory mesmerize church audiences,” Sharpton says. “I don’t see that as a problem.”</p>\n<p>Other candidates will also be competing hard to win the support of black voters in South Carolina&#8212;<strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> stopped by for a rally on Wednesday&#8212;and demographics guarantee Booker and Harris nothing. Which doesn’t mean, of course, that they won’t try to turn that commonality into an advantage, and that they won’t inevitably fight over the same voters. Harris has been heavily emphasizing the fact that she attended the historically black Howard University, and on Friday she will speak at a charity event hosted by a chapter of her college sorority&#8212;in Columbia, South Carolina. Booker’s campaign would try to draw a contrast between his street-level empathy and Harris’s years as a prosecutor. “It would be wrong to think that just because you’re black, the African-American electorate is going to rally around you,” Belcher says. “If that were true, Barack Obama wouldn’t have been losing to Hillary Clinton by 20 or 30 points before we put in a plan. Every campaign has to find its lane. Kamala, and Booker, if he runs, are going to have to work to win over the audience of African-American voters. They are central to anyone becoming the nominee. And if you cannot come in first or second place in South Carolina, you cannot be the Democratic nominee.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The family drama surrounding <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/biden-2020-front-runner-family-divorce-drama?inline\">Joe Biden’s presidential bid</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; What to make of the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/buzzfeed-mueller-saga-veteran-journalists-circumspect-confused?inline\">BuzzFeed-Mueller mystery</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; A happy ending for one <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/fyre-festival-caterer-gofundme-maryann-rolle?inline\">Fyre Festival contractor</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Intrigue in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jesse-angelo-abruptly-exits-the-new-york-post-murdoch?inline\">Murdoch-land</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Yes, <em>Schitt’s Creek</em> really is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/yes-schitts-creek-really-is-that-good?inline\">that good</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"2020","socialTitle":"“He Seems So Hammed Up”: Cory Booker Battles an Authenticity Problem","socialDescription":"The former Newark mayor can tell a compelling story about urban issues and his own background.

Surprise people, of course! On Tuesday, <strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong> did just that as he welcomed <strong>Michelle Obama</strong> back to <em>The Tonight Show</em>&#8212;to the great delight of many guests at 30 Rock. The gambit? Very simple: stand outside the elevators and wait.</p>\n<p>As the doors opened, multiple tour groups at NBC’s headquarters were treated to the surprise of a lifetime: Fallon and Michelle Obama, waiting to be glimpsed by them. One group saw the pair sitting in armchairs, casually reading one another’s books. Another saw the two playing around with a piano. Yet another saw Obama jumping rope. Regardless of what Obama was doing, the reaction was always the same: gleeful screams.</p>\n<p>This is not the first time Obama and Fallon have teamed up for a heartwarming prank. Last year, as the Obamas departed the White House, Fallon invited guests to record farewell messages for Michelle&#8212;but did not inform them that the First Lady was listening to their heartfelt words from behind a screen. The reactions were about as <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/michelle-obama-tonight-show\">emotional</a> as you’d expect. In fact, the idea was such a success that Fallon later repeated it with guests including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=expKmfdoo28\"><strong>Chadwick Boseman</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/04/tina-fey-surprise-mean-girls-fans-jimmy-fallon-tonight-show\"><strong>Tina Fey</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this is the kind of late-night fare we could use more of. After all, gleeful videos of celebrity pranks and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/cardi-b-carpool-karaoke-james-corden-late-late-show\">senior-center concerts</a> make a pretty solid balm for troubled souls.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8211; Is this the end of <a

Eleven years after a young <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> purchased an aging skyscraper that would become an albatross around his family’s neck, and six months before the Kushners would have to cough up the $1.4 billion that was due on the mortgage for 666 Fifth Avenue, a Canadian asset-management company <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/nyregion/kushners-building-fifth-avenue-brookfield-lease.html\">swooped in</a> and agreed to take a 99-year lease on the building, paying a near-century’s worth of rent upfront. The bailout was surprising for a few reasons, chief among them being comments by the Kushners’ previous partner that 666 Fifth “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/is-jared-kushner-the-worlds-worst-real-estate-investor\">would be worth a lot more if it was just dirt</a>,” plus the fact that the family had spent two years trying to get new partners or financing to no avail. Also, there was the matter of the Qatar Investment Authority being a major investor in the company, Brookfield Asset Management, and Kushner’s <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/jared-kushner-backed-qatar-blockade-after-qataris-wouldnt-finance-his-property-828847\">support of a Saudi- and U.A.E.-led blockade of Qatar</a>. To some, it sure <em>sounded</em> like a foreign government was trying to influence policy by greasing the president’s son-in-law’s wheels! At the time, Brookfield told reporters that the Qataris “had no knowledge of the deal before its public announcement”&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/nyregion/kushner-deal-qatar-666-5th.html\">apparently they don’t read <em>The New York Times</em></a>&#8212;and now that the deal has officially gone through, Doha is doubling down, insisting, somewhat curiously, that the government <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qatar-fund-kushner-insight/qatar-revamps-investment-strategy-after-kushner-building-bailout-idUSKCN1Q00W3\">had absolutely nothing to do with the 666 debacle</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When news emerged that Qatar may have unwittingly helped bail out a New York skyscraper owned by the family of Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, eyebrows were raised in Doha. . . . The bailout, in which Doha played no part and first learned about in the media, has prompted a rethink of how the gas-rich kingdom invests money abroad via its giant sovereign wealth fund, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The country has decided that the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) will aim to avoid putting money in funds or other investment vehicles it does not have full control over, according to the sources, who are familiar with the QIA’s strategy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Qatar started looking into how its name got involved into the deal and found out it was because of a fund it co-owned,” said one of the sources. “So QIA ultimately triggered a strategy revamp.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is it possible that Qatar truly had no knowledge of its role in doing a major solid for the Kushners just months before a make-or-break deadline? Sure, just like literally anything is possible. But many are suspicious!</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/jedshug/status/1095198659870945281\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jedshug/status/1095198659870945281\">https://twitter.com/jedshug/status/1095198659870945281</a></p></blockquote></div><div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/espiers/status/1095362087038140416\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/espiers/status/1095362087038140416\">https://twitter.com/espiers/status/1095362087038140416</a></p></blockquote></div><p>In addition to likely having had the chance to hear about the deal through Brookfield directly or read about it in the paper of record, one would imagine the Qataris were keeping tabs on all things Kushner on account of Jared’s father, <strong>Charles Kushner,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kushner-companies-confirms-meeting-with-qatar-on-financing/2018/03/18/55e281ac-1e3c-11e8-9de1-147dd2df3829_story.html\">taking a meeting</a> with Qatar’s finance minister, <strong>Ali Sharif Al Emadi</strong> in April 2017.

One stop on his itinerary is likely to steal the show.","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>This weekend, <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> will board a military plane and embark on a six-country trip to present foreign diplomats with part of his long-awaited proposal to solve an epic quandary and bring peace to the Middle East. Kushner has said that he and the other members of the trip, including Middle East envoy <strong>Jason Greenblatt,</strong> State Department policy adviser <strong>Brian Hook,</strong> and deputy assistant to the president <strong>Avi Berkowitz,</strong> will not present the full peace plan until after the Israeli elections in April. Instead, they will gauge support for various economic incentives in the proposal, including foreign aid for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. These enticements are intended to persuade Palestinian officials to seek a broader deal.</p>\n<p>Over the course of seven days, Kushner’s team will travel to Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey. They will also make a stop in Saudi Arabia, where Kushner plans to meet with Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman.</strong> It will be the first time the two will meet since 15 Saudis brutally strangled <em>Washington Post</em> journalist Jamal Khashoggi and dismembered him with a bone saw last fall.</p>\n<p>Kushner and M.B.S., as he is known, struck up a relationship nearly two years ago, when the Saudi prince visited the White House. Kushner and M.B.S., youthful heirs with complex family rivalries, have met a handful of times since. For a while, it was a mutually beneficial alliance. M.B.S. provided Kushner with a key ally and envoy in the region. Kushner, in turn, convinced his father-in-law to make Riyadh his first stop on a sweeping presidential tour of the Middle East, and helped promote an arms deal between the United States and the kingdom. But their bond came under great scrutiny last fall, after the assassination of Khashoggi.</p>\n<p>In the days following, Kushner reached out to M.B.S as the administration launched its investigation, and urged him to be as transparent as possible. (The C.I.A. later concluded that M.B.S. ordered the operation, although the Saudi government has denied the crown prince played any role in the killing.) In a rare town-hall interview with CNN in October, Kushner offered a chilling realpolitik explanation for the administration’s failure to condemn the Saudis. “We have to be able to work with our allies,” he said. “The Middle East is a rough place. It’s been a rough place for a very long time, and we have to be able to pursue our strategic objectives, but we also have to deal with what obviously seems to be a terrible situation.”</p>\n<p>The uncomfortable optics of the meeting are not lost on those planning the road show. But Kushner is meeting with the heads of states from the region, a person familiar with the trip explained, and M.B.S. is a head of state. Indeed, Saudi Arabia appears to be the lynchpin of Kushner’s unprecedented strategy to forge lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Whereas past administrations sought to negotiate with both parties, the Trump White House is hoping to assemble a coalition of Gulf states aligned against Iran to exert influence in the region.</p>\n<p>The whirlwind tour will come on the heels of a two-day conference in Warsaw last week, during which Kushner met with leaders from 60 countries and obliquely discussed the plan. Israeli Prime Minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu,</strong> who was in attendance during Kushner’s closed-door presentation, reportedly <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/israel-gulf-states-commend-kushners-peace-effort-11550182508\">congratulated</a> him for being “crazy enough” to “come up with ideas” to resolve the conflict. A foreign-affairs minister from Saudi Arabia also offered support for Kushner’s plan, according to <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Palestinian officials, who have not engaged in peace talks since the U.S. moved its embassy to Jerusalem, did not attend the conference. On Friday, Kushner, the grandson of Holocaust survivors, joined Vice President <strong>Mike Pence</strong> at Auschwitz-Birkenau, before they flew to Germany for the weekend to attend the Munich Security Conference. Kushner’s wife, <strong>Ivanka Trump,</strong> also made the trip.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Much has been said recently, both inside and outside the White House, about Jared and Ivanka’s influence within the Trump administration. The couple survived a series of power struggles with <strong>Steve Bannon, Sean Spicer, Reince Priebus,</strong> and finally <strong>John Kelly.</strong> With the West Wing thinned out, aides have been referring to Kushner as the de facto chief of staff, one person close to the couple told me. But it’s not that Jared or Ivanka have more power as a result of others leaving. It’s that Trumpworld is finally beginning to understand the extent of the power they’ve had all along. “They’ve always been son and daughter of a president who is a famously familial person,” this person said. “The people who misunderstood that are no longer there. Everything takes time, and they have the luxury of time in this administration when most other people do not.”</p>\n<p>Trump, of course, is most comfortable when the West Wing is operating as a family office. It was how he ran his business in Trump Tower, and it remains the best way to assess who has staying power. It also helps to explain why, despite an anti-nepotism law that stood for 50 years, he deputized his son-in-law to lead some of the most significant foreign-policy initiatives of his administration, and why his daughter frequently represents the administration on trips abroad. While the rest of the White House is in a state of constant turnover, Kushner remains firmly ensconced in a closet of an office near the Oval. Ivanka has a sunny corner room just upstairs, outside of which hangs a blown-up photo of her and Kushner dancing onstage at inauguration, with a note from her dad scrawled out in gold Sharpie, saying how proud of them he was.</p>\n<p>They still worry about how they are portrayed in the media, though the negative press has slowed as their antagonists have left the White House. When Ivanka sat down with ABC for an interview earlier this year, she was caught off guard by questions she thought had been deemed off-limits, according to two people familiar with the situation. But as time has gone on, Jared and Ivanka, like everyone else, have cared less and less about about each individual story. The country, after all, has reached a late stage of Trump fatigue. Though news cameras panned to take in Ivanka’s stony expression in Munich when German chancellor <strong>Angela Merkel</strong> criticized her father’s foreign policy, the schadenfreude was fleeting. Back in New York, their social circle is similarly dazed. One former friend of the couple shrugged when NBC News <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/officials-rejected-jared-kushner-top-secret-security-clearance-were-overruled-n962221\">reported</a> that Kushner had only gotten his security clearance restored after a Trump appointee overrode the recommendation of career White House security specialists. “Tomorrow, no one is going to talk about this,” this person said. “Is anything ever going to stick?”</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Middle East","socialTitle":"Jared Kushner Is Preparing for Another Face-to-Face Meeting with M.B.S.","socialDescription":"Kushner is embarking on a six-country tour to begin rolling out his Middle East peace plan.

Like <strong>Omarosa Manigault Newman, Sean Spicer, Mr. Mooch,</strong> and all the previous Dickensian characters gunning for their own spin-off series, the former governor of New Jersey has picked up a pen to put his dysfunctional time around the White House to paper. The book, <em>Let Me Finish,</em> isn’t only about the president’s son-in-law, <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> who manages to wield power in Washington despite all odds, but much of it is, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/chris-christie-book-trump.html\"><strong>Maggie Haberman’s</strong> report</a> in <em>The New York Times.</em></p>\n<p>The two men have a history. When he was U.S. attorney for New Jersey, Christie prosecuted Jared’s father, <strong>Charles Kushner,</strong> on 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering, and making illegal campaign donations. The elder Kushner served 14 months at a federal prison camp in Alabama beginning in 2005. (He served the rest of his term in a halfway house in Newark.) Kushner the younger, then 25, visited him on most weekends, and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/12/jared-kushner-education-donald-trump\">reportedly blames Christie</a> for refusing to release the elder Kushner from his sentence 28 days early, as the family expected.</p>\n<p>And now, Christie claims, Kushner’s son held the grudge for years. He describes a meeting in which <strong>Donald Trump</strong> put together his transition team, when Kushner said, in front of Christie, “He tried to destroy my father.” Christie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/11/chris-christie-dropped-trump-transition-team\">was eventually replaced</a> by Vice President <strong>Mike Pence&#8212;</strong> though at the time, Christie was dealing with impeachment murmurs in Trenton after two of his former aides were convicted on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/11/chris-christie-dropped-trump-transition-team\">counts related to the notorious Bridgegate incident</a>. Still, he remained close to the White House, and as his name came up for various appointments like attorney general and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/us/politics/chris-christie-trump-chief-staff.html?module=inline\">chief of staff</a>, he would hear from various staffers that Kushner had intervened. He would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn’t for that meddling kid.</p>\n<p>So how do you undermine the underminer in this administration, in this particular MAGA moment? Accuse someone of eating salads <em>every day.</em> Kushner decided to join a lunch that Christie and his wife had scheduled with President Trump on Valentine’s Day 2017. As Kushner was enjoying one of his “typical salads,” Christie wrote, Trump expressed confusion over why firing <strong>Michael Flynn</strong> didn’t end the Russia probe, while Christie laughed in his face, per the former governor’s telling:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“‘Sir,’ I said, ‘this Russia thing is far from over,’” Mr. Christie\nwrote. Mr. Trump responded: “What do you mean? Flynn met with the\nRussians. That was the problem. I fired Flynn. It’s over.” Mr. Kushner\nadded, “That’s right, firing Flynn ends the whole Russia thing.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What else can you expect from a person who eats <em>leaves</em>? Christie is making a wise move here, positioning himself as the one guy who can save the Trump White House from the self-inflicted damage of listening to salad-eaters. Maybe it will pay off for him in the Infowars-supplement crowd.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Behind the scenes of Rent’s new <a

immigration.","promoDek":"The president’s son-in-law is convinced that he&#8212;and he alone&#8212;can strike a compromise on immigration.","body":"<p><strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, is hoping he can break the impasse between <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and the Democrats on immigration, reportedly spitballing solutions to the problem during a White House whiteboard meeting last week in an effort to, as one attendee told Axios, “replicate” for border security the kind of bipartisan deal he managed to strike on criminal-justice reform. “They would like to try and replicate at some level a bipartisan coalition on immigration issues, something paired with border security as well,” <strong>Mark Holden,</strong> a Koch Industries executive, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/jared-kushner-immigration-plans-government-shutdown-f5e144d4-5342-4509-a56e-627eb1a8a9c1.html\">told</a> the publication.</p>\n<p>It’s an ambitious&#8212;and likely unrealistic&#8212;undertaking. Last year, Kushner convinced Trump, who ran as a law-and-order candidate, to sign a bill that emphasized reducing recidivism rates, providing exemptions to mandatory minimum sentences, and expanding opportunities for early release in what was seen as a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/criminal-justice-reform-bill-metaphor-for-the-trump-presidency-that-wasnt\">strong step</a> toward improving the broken criminal-justice system. In that instance, however, he was simply nailing down specifics around a bipartisan consensus. As a senior White House official put it to Axios, “He convinced Democrats to support something they already agreed with.”</p>\n<p>That’s not so with immigration. Here, Trump’s marquee demand is his long-promised border wall, which he wants close to $6 billion in taxpayer dollars to build. Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, have no desire or reason to give it to him, particularly after Trump caved on his own request last week and reopened the government without a cent for the wall. To get Dems to budge, Kushner will have to offer a concession significant enough for them to consider yielding the upper hand. The problem, of course, lies in convincing his father-in-law to go along with such a concession, especially in the face of inevitable backlash from his base.</p>\n<p>Further complicating the issue is Trump’s warning that, if a bipartisan panel doesn’t come up with a workable solution by February 15, he’ll either shut down the government again&#8212;something <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> and other Republicans on Capitol Hill have suggested they <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/427574-no-gop-appetite-for-a-second-shutdown\">could overrule</a>&#8212;or declare a national emergency to fund the wall without Congress. Putting the nuclear option on the table, as Trump apparently did against Kushner’s wishes, may already have doomed a potential compromise. After all, what motivation does Trump’s base have to go along with a middle ground when they’re convinced he can easily avoid compromising altogether?</p>\n<p>Given all the obstacles in his path, even conservatives are questioning why Kushner thinks he can succeed where so many others have failed. “Border security and immigration reform are much more complex issues than criminal justice reform,” Tea Party Patriots co-founder <strong>Jenny Beth Martin</strong> told Axios. Kushner’s mandate, which includes nothing less than the reinvention of the executive branch itself, has always seemed comically broad, in part due to his total lack of relevant experience or expertise. But with two parties at total loggerheads, and apparently no confidence from the president, he seems especially in over his head, despite his insistence that he’s the one who can “land this plane.” “Unless he’s able to convince his father-in-law to abandon his obsession with building a medieval border wall,” Rep. <strong>Hakeem Jeffries</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/us/politics/jared-kushner-immigration-reform.html\">told</a> <em>The New York Times,</em> “then he’s not going to be successful in finding a bipartisan agreement.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The family drama surrounding <a

Trade negotiations with China, a nation he was supposed to be bolstering relations with, have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/466cc9e2-1e4c-11e9-b126-46fc3ad87c65\">unraveled</a>. His friendship with <strong>Mohammed bin Salman</strong> got <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/playtime-over-for-jared-kushner-and-his-new-saudi-friends\">bone-sawed</a>. A top Palestinian negotiator recently called the First Son-in-Law a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/palestinian-negotiator-called-kushner-a-glorified-real-estate-agent\">glorified “real-estate agent.”</a></p>\n<p>Kushner’s name might not come to mind, then, when picturing a political strategist with the requisite skills, experience, and influence to end the government shutdown, now in its second month. But, possessed of the same delusional self-confidence that’s led him to reckon <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/jared-kushner-sean-hannity-saudi-arabia\"><em>he</em>’s going to be the guy to finally bring peace the Middle East</a>, the Boy Prince of New Jersey apparently believes he’s just days away from getting the Democrats to crack.</p>\n<p><em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/master-negotiator-or-nonentity-kushner-thrusts-himself-into-middle-of-shutdown-debate/2019/01/23/a8b5bf42-1e69-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html\">reports</a> that Kushner, “fueled by a burst of self-confidence following his help in passing criminal-justice legislation”&#8212;which, as a refresher, had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/politics/senate-criminal-justice-bill.html\">wide bipartisan support</a>&#8212;has recently “thrust” himself in the middle of shutdown talks, positive that he will be the dealmaker to break the impasse while somehow also getting <strong>Donald Trump</strong> his wall:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Repeatedly assuring Trump that he can personally strike a deal with Democrats, Kushner has overshadowed other advisers in a largely empty West Wing this month. He usually huddles to discuss strategy each morning with the president, Vice President Pence and a few others, White House aides said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Convinced that Senate Democrats will eventually crack and that there are votes for a bipartisan agreement, Kushner has urged the president to dig in while also adjusting his position as his popularity suffers in public polls, according to a person close to him and White House officials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the <em>Post,</em> “Kushner’s imprint” was all over the president’s offer to Democrats last weekend, which <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> immediately rejected. Yet the First Son-in-Law is unbowed, telling advisers that he has “solid relationships with several Democrats” and “can sell a compromise” to moderate lawmakers “with whom he built a rapport while working on the criminal-justice bill.” Except there’s one small flaw in that plan:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“He is totally a nonentity,” one senior Democratic aide said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, Senator <strong>Lisa Murkowski,</strong> one of those key moderates who Kushner evidently believes he has a great rapport with, said Wednesday that <strong>Ivanka’s</strong> husband “doesn’t have the experience” of someone like Pence, who actually worked on Capitol Hill. “It’s really hard to understand the dynamics unless you’ve really been immersed in this,” she added, presumably trying to let Little Kush down easy.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, White House mouthpiece <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> has gone on the record to claim “it’s no wonder the President asked him to join the negotiating team to work on a deal to open the government and secure our border,” on account of Kushner’s work on criminal-justice reform and a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/10/01/trumps-new-nafta-is-pretty-much-the-same-as-the-old-one-but-at-what-cost/?utm_term=.00d685353e10\">essentially the same as the old agreement</a>. Behind the scenes, however, administration officials are more skeptical:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Shahira Knight,</strong> the legislative affairs director, has expressed unease with the White House’s operation during the shutdown. Another senior White House official called Kushner’s positioning “delusional.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Trump reportedly endorsed Kushner’s efforts in a recent Oval Office meeting, in a backhanded sort of way. “Apparently, Jared has become an expert on immigration in the last 48 hours,” he exclaimed (playfully!), according to people in the room. Less confident in the Kush is acting chief of staff <strong>Mick Mulvaney,</strong> who is reportedly making preparations for the government shutdown to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/white-house-seeks-list-of-programs-that-would-be-hurt-if-shutdown-lasts-into-march/2019/01/23/661adb3a-1f55-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html\">continue through March, or even April</a>.

has some interesting views on federal crime.","body":"<p>The Trump White House was always bound to be a low-wattage operation, considering the professional grifters the campaign attracted. Candidate Trump, after all, never actually planned on <em>winning</em> the election. Still, the incoming administration had a chance to avoid making complete and total fools of itself in the months before the inauguration, by (begrudgingly) hiring <strong>Chris Christie</strong> to run federally-mandated preparations to take over the government. While hardly anyone’s idea of a political savant, the former governor of New Jersey was at the very least a semi-competent manager who had served as both a federal prosecutor and in an executive role. Christie, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/27/this-guy-doesnt-know-anything-the-inside-story-of-trumps-shambolic-transition-team\">by all accounts</a>, spent much of 2016 trying to find quality Republican establishment appointees to serve in the administration, so that Trump’s government might have a chance at functioning. But shortly after winning the election, the ex-Miss Universe owner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/27/this-guy-doesnt-know-anything-the-inside-story-of-trumps-shambolic-transition-team\">decided</a> to unceremoniously fire the guy, throw his team’s work in the trash, and handle things “more or less by himself,” a turn of events that led to the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-didnt-realize-a-government-shutdown-would-shut-down-the-government\">bumbling shit-show that is our current executive branch</a>. And apparently, we have <strong>Jared Kushner’s</strong> unique view of the law to thank for that.</p>\n<p>In a memoir slated for release at the end of the month, the ex&#8211;New Jersey governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/15/chris-christie-book-jared-kushner-accusations-hit-job\">accuses</a> the First Son-in-Law of carrying out a political “hit job” on him as revenge for prosecuting his father, <strong>Charles Kushner,</strong> a decade prior. For those not up to speed on the criminal history of the president’s in-laws, in 2005, Kushner the Elder pleaded guilty to 18 counts of illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering, following an investigation by then&#8211;U.S. Attorney Chris Christie. The witness-tampering charge was a result of Chuck’s decision to retaliate against his sister’s husband, <strong>William Schulder,</strong> who was cooperating with the feds, by hiring a sex worker to seduce him, filming the encounter, and sending the tape to his sister. Jared, unsurprisingly, had bad feelings about his father going to prison for 14 months, though his anger didn’t lie with his (extremely guilty) dad but rather prosecutors, who a man now working in the upper echelons of the U.S. government believed had overstepped their bounds.  During an April 2016 meeting, the Boy Prince of New Jersey reportedly pleaded with his father-in-law not to name Christie transition chairman, implying, per Christie, that “I had acted unethically and inappropriately,” and making the bold claim that when it came to the sex tape and the blackmailing, such things were “family matter[s], matter[s] to be handled by the family or the rabbis.”</p>\n<p>Trump ended up hiring Christie anyway, but Jared, who seemingly believes criminal acts should be settled at a diner on the New Jersey Turnpike, never relented. Shortly after the election, he got his wish: Christie was given the heave-ho and told by then&#8211;senior adviser <strong>Steve Bannon</strong> that “one person only was responsible for the . . . execution . . . Jared Kushner, still apparently seething over events that had occurred decades ago,” an account <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/27/this-guy-doesnt-know-anything-the-inside-story-of-trumps-shambolic-transition-team\">echoed</a> in <strong>Michael Lewis’s</strong> book about the administration. “The kid’s been taking an ax to your head with the boss ever since I got here,” Bannon apparently told Christie.</p>\n<p>While the former governor of New Jersey has his own history of <a href=\"https://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/mc-nws-nj-bridgegate-cost-15-million-20180430-story.html\">political revenge</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/15-chris-christie-controversies-you-missed-101999\">corruption</a>, and score-settling, Jared Kushner has gone on the record with his belief that his father did nothing wrong in committing a host of federal crimes. In 2009, he <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/57891/index1.html\">explained</a> to <em>New York</em> magazine that his father was actually the true victim in all this: “His siblings stole every piece of paper from his office, and they took it to the government,” Jared insisted, not mentioning that the things on the pieces of paper showed evidence his father had committed a cornucopia of crimes. “Siblings that he literally made wealthy for doing nothing. He gave them interests in the business for nothing. All he did was put the tape together and send it. Was it the right thing to do? At the end of the day, it was a function of saying, ‘You’re trying to make my life miserable? Well, I’m doing the same.’”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Lessons from the “Trump and the Media” <a

While in Palm Beach, Florida, the couple decompressed from their political power positions, and the stress of the government shutdown, by venturing out to the local multiplex to see a movie.</p>\n<p>The duo had an array of screening options. If they wanted to go light, they could have seen <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/mary-poppins-returns-movie-review-emily-blunt\">Mary Poppins Returns</a>.</em> If they wanted to feel hopeful about the next chapter of their lives, they could have checked out <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/jennifer-lopez-movie-interview\"><strong>Jennifer Lopez’s</strong></a> feel-good comedy <em>Second Act.</em> If they were in darker moods, they could have opted for the gritty <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/nicole-kidman-destroyer-big-little-lies\"><strong>Nicole Kidman</strong></a> thriller <em>Destroyer.</em> But for controversial key figures in a highly divisive political administration, the couple went in an interesting direction, according to <a href=\"https://people.com/politics/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-saw-vice-but-left/\"><em>People</em></a>&#8212;by seeing <em>Vice,</em> <strong>Adam McKay’s</strong> biopic about <em>another</em> controversial key figure in a highly divisive political administration: <strong>Dick Cheney.</strong></p>\n<p>Sure, it is a little curious why the president’s senior aides were at a Florida multiplex at all during a government shutdown. (Though <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/christian-bale-vice-heart-attack\"><strong>Christian Bale</strong></a> really is great.) And if they <em>were</em> going to wait out their administration’s consequential political decision in a movie theater, why wouldn’t they at least pick a different film? Aren’t movies supposed to be escapes from our own dark realities?</p>\n<p>But there is another intriguing detail to the report: “Partway through the showing, [Trump] and Kushner and their Secret Service detail got up and left,” per <em>People.</em> “It remains unclear what prompted the exit, though the witness describes it as abrupt.”</p>\n<p>What was the reason behind the sudden exit? A source close to the administration confirms to <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s <strong>Emily Jane Fox</strong> that the couple did see the movie during their vacation, and did exit early&#8212;though close to the end of the film. So they could not have been upset by Bale and <strong>Amy Adams’s</strong> bedroom <em>Macbeth</em> monologue, which takes place about halfway through the film, or the split-second cutaway to a young <strong>Donald Trump.</strong> If they had been shaken by the portrayal of a morally bankrupt business executive pursuing his own personal interests inside the White House, they presumably would have left a little earlier in the film.</p>\n<p>So maybe it was the gory heart-attack details that got to them? Maybe the early exit was just a security precaution. Or maybe there was simply an issue with the babysitter&#8212;er, two nannies&#8212;at home.</p>\n<p><em>Vice</em> is not the only entertainment project premiering last year that McKay used to hold a mirror up to the members of the First Family. McKay also executive produces the HBO series <em>Succession,</em> which was partially inspired by the trials of Kushner’s family.</p>\n<p>“The show very much reflects our time&#8212;this whole idea of a generation of rich kids who have this sense of entitlement. We see examples of it every day in the press, particularly in relation to our POTUS,” McKay told <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/hbo-succession-rupert-murdoch-trump-kushner-family\"><em>Vanity Fair</em></a> earlier this year. McKay wondered what Kushner’s family might think of <em>that</em> project of his, telling us, “Would they watch it and be like, ‘Oh cool, it’s us.’ Or would they watch it and be like, ‘Those sons of bitches, how dare they?’ My guess is they don’t watch it. I would love to hear a reaction from one of these families.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/58b09b14fd2e6133ee000003.js?muted=1\"></div></div><h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Don’t call it a Dernaissance, call it <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/laura-dern-cover-story?inline\">Laura Dern’s much-deserved close-up</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Ethan Hawke gets candid about the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/ethan-hawke-kevin-spacey-harvey-weinstein-little-gold-men-interview?inline\">Weinsteins and Spaceys of the world</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; “I have a little bit of control over my destiny” <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/nicole-kidman-destroyer-big-little-lies?inline\">&#8212;Nicole Kidman</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Harrowing tales from the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/st-barths-yacht-season-pippa-middleton-jared-leto-les-moonves?inline\">St. Barth’s Yacht Convention</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The year ahead in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/the-year-ahead-in-royals-2019?inline\">British royalty</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hollywood newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"HOLIDAY VACATION","socialTitle":"The Mystery of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s Movie Date","socialDescription":"The D.C. power couple took in Adam McKay’s political biopic Vice over the holidays.","seoTitle":"Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s Mystery Movie Date","seoDescription":"Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner—along with their Secret Service detail—took in a surprising choice of movie over their holiday break.","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Award Season","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":[],"revisionAuthor":"Anna  Raya","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"interactiveOverride":"","id":"5c37cdf69565e41ee72418b6","revision":47,"createdAt":"January 10, 2019 5:57 pm","modifiedAt":"January 10, 2019 9:32 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 10, 2019 9:32 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Hollywood","slug":"hollywood","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fae03af0739cf33e0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Award Season","slug":"award-season","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120b4f5c10202b9717a","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Movies","slug":"movies","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120c639a3587939aa6b","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Julie Miller is a Senior Hollywood writer for <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s website.

He <a href=\"http://www.saveourschoolsnj.org/2017/12/19/save-our-school-nj-cautiously-looks-forward-to-a-post-chris-christie-new-jersey/\">gutted</a> public-school funding and regularly <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/christie-defends-berating-constituent-for-asking-if-he-sends-his-kids-to-private-school-4664c752b3ad/\">brawled with constituents</a>. He closed state beaches on Fourth of July weekend, only to be caught lounging on one <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/03/535335917/chris-christie-closed-new-jersey-s-beaches-and-then-went-to-the-beach\">without a care in the world</a>. Then, of course, there was “<a href=\"https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/columnists/charles-stile/2018/11/28/bridgegate-scandal-closure-not-coming-soon-guilty-pair-chris-christie/2126842002/\">Bridgegate</a>,” an act of petty retribution the governor supposedly knew nothing about, despite the fact that it sounded <em>exactly</em> like something he would do. Unsurprisingly, Christie left office <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-chris-christie-became-least-popular-governor-in-new-jersey-history-2018-1\">with a 14 percent approval rating</a>. But there’s nothing like an exponentially worse politician to rehab one’s image by comparison, a dynamic the former governor has really leaned into over the past month!</p>\n<p>Yukking it up at a party to celebrate the release of his memoir, <em>Let Me Finish,</em> at the 9,000-square-foot penthouse of hedge-fund manager <strong>Steve Cohen</strong>&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.6sqft.com/billionaires-midtown-penthouse-got-the-biggest-price-chop-in-nyc-history-now-70m-off/\">which could be yours for the severely discounted price of $45 million</a>&#8212;Christie <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-13/christie-handicaps-the-field-of-democratic-presidential-hopefuls\">reportedly</a> regaled the crowd with his takes on the 2020 field. On <strong>Kamala Harris:</strong> “She’s articulate and she presents herself pretty well, O.K. So she’s got some advantages.” <strong>Cory Booker</strong>? “Everybody’s going to listen to that first speech and go, ‘I love him.’ Will they love him for the second speech, third speech, and fourth speech, and is there a second speech, third speech, and fourth speech?” <strong>Joe Biden</strong>? Apparently it comes down to if he comes off as “the adult in the room” or “crazy Uncle Joe . . . saying wacky stuff.” <strong>Amy Klobuchar</strong>? Christie, who dropped out of the Republican primary after winning just 7 percent of the vote in New Hampshire, thinks this business about her <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/amy-klobuchar-you-bet-your-ass-im-a-tough-boss\">reportedly</a> being awful to her staff will be tough to overcome. Christie, who claims he was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jared-kushner-chris-christie-book\">kicked off the White House transition team</a> by <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> also made a point of enumerating all the jobs <strong>Donald Trump</strong> <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/chris-christie-donald-trump-white-house-discussion-a8e00121-f094-4197-a62c-53d4cbcba20e.html\">supposedly offered him</a>: “Secretary of labor, twice. Secretary of homeland security, twice. Ambassador to Rome. Ambassador to the Vatican. And special assistant to the president.”</p>\n<p>Cohen’s Midtown duplex was a fitting pit stop on Christie’s current rehabilitation tour, given their long, mutualistic relationship. When Cohen’s hedge fund S.A.C. Capital Advisors <a href=\"https://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/11/chris_christie_invited_embattled_hedge-fund_billionare_steve_cohen_to_victory_party_report_says.html\">pleaded guilty to insider trading</a>, Christie <a href=\"https://dealbreaker.com/2013/11/chris-christie-and-steve-cohen-had-a-little-chat\">bucked Cohen up</a> the very next day with an invite to his re-election party and a private dinner. (Cohen himself was never charged.) Later, in 2015, Cohen <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/22/steven-cohen-pledges-250000-to-pro-christie-super-pac/\">wrote sizable checks to a pro-Christie super-PAC back when the governor had his eye on the White House</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/cfc76f84-a44f-4420-b825-6b55c781fab4?customColor=%23ff0000\"><iframe height=\"250\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/cfc76f84-a44f-4420-b825-6b55c781fab4?customColor=%23ff0000\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong><em>iTunes user?

In <em>Let Me Finish,</em> Christie <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jared-kushner-chris-christie-book\">claims</a> that Jared got him fired from Trump’s transition as revenge for prosecuting his father over a decade earlier. Jared, it seems, argued that the then-U.S. attorney general should have minded his own business when it came to Charles’s decision to hire a prostitute to seduce his sister’s husband&#8212;who was cooperating with the feds at the time&#8212;tape the encounter, and send the tape to his sister. According to Christie, Jared insisted such things were “family matter[s], matter[s] to be handled by the family or the rabbis,” an argument he has somehow made <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/57891/index1.html\">on more than one occasion</a>!</p>\n<p>Whether throwing Trump and Jared under the bus will be enough to refurbish Christie in the public eye remains to be seen. On the plus side, several of the president’s stooges and lackeys who have <a

Khashoggi, and <strong>Donald Trump</strong> shrugged it off. Sure, U.S. intelligence agencies <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html\">concluded</a> that Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman</strong> had ordered the hit (which Saudi Arabia denied), and yes, lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/04/graham-senate-rebuke-saudi-arabia-1041379\">offered</a> some vocal criticism of the regime, but all in all, things worked out pretty well for M.B.S., who received neither punishment nor condemnation from the White House over the grisly dismemberment of a <em>Washington Post</em> columnist and U.S. resident. And yet, according to <em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-crown-prince-pivots-to-asia-from-critical-west-11550249887\">the young prince is pissed</a>!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Saudi Arabia’s crown prince is embarking on a five-country sweep through Asia to nurture alliances there as the murder of a Saudi dissident and the Saudi-led war in Yemen continue to disrupt the kingdom’s relations with the U.S. and European powers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Angered by Western criticism, Prince Mohammed Bin Salman has told aides that he would seek diplomatic support from Asian powers including China and India, according to senior Saudi government advisers. . . . The tour includes stops in China and India&#8212;for whom a stronger relationship with the heir to the Saudi throne could help secure energy resources for their expanding economies&#8212;along with Malaysia, Indonesia, and Pakistan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to reporters <strong>Jared Malsin</strong> and <strong>Summer Said,</strong> bin Salman “will likely receive a warmer reception on his Asia tour, as he focuses on trade and relations” with governments that are unlikely to raise pesky, downright offensive objections to Saudi Arabia’s less-than-stellar human-rights record. (In addition to the Khashoggi killing and Yemen, Human Rights Watch estimated last year that the Kingdom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/26/saudi-arabia-criticised-over-executions-for-drug-offences\">executed</a> 48 people in the first four months of 2018 alone, many for nonviolent offenses.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The tour is set to begin on Sunday in Pakistan, where the crown prince is bringing the promise of billions of dollars in support to an ally facing an economic crisis. Prince Mohammed is expected to sign at least $12 billion in agreements, including plans for a new oil refinery, investments in renewable energy, and an umbrella agreement to invest in the mining sector. He is also expected to approve an agreement to supply $3 billion in oil on a deferred payment basis. . . . In China, Prince Mohammed will meet the leaders of a country that is an important customer for oil and gas exports&#8212;Saudi Arabia is China’s largest supplier of crude. Beijing is itself investing in infrastructure and trade to extend its influence throughout Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While M.B.S. may indeed be feeling sensitive about the U.S., whose outrage over Khashoggi he <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-prince-salman-reportedly-confused-khashoggi-outrage-report-2018-10\">reportedly</a> couldn’t comprehend, there may still be an opportunity to patch things up. <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/world/middleeast/saudi-mbs-jared-kushner.html\">special friend in the White House</a>, will shortly embark on a tour of the Middle East that will include <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/07/kushner-mideast-peace-plan-1157710\">a pit stop in Saudi Arabia</a>. Said pit stop will presumably entail an intimate dinner in which the First Son-in-Law will assure the prince that everyone in Washington has his back, and that together, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-killing-saudi-arabia.html\">they’ll get through this</a>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Some people are taking the Amazon news better than others</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/mrkorangy/status/1096434850607910914\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrkorangy/status/1096434850607910914\">https://twitter.com/mrkorangy/status/1096434850607910914</a></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>On second thought, Deutsche Bank won’t go through with its pledge to help distressed homeowners</strong></p>\n<p>Back in late 2016, as part of a $7.2 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over crappy mortgage bonds it sold in the lead-up to the financial crisis, Deutsche Bank promised to spend $4 billion on consumer relief. Specifically, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-deutsche-bank-mueller-2017-12\">the president’s favorite bank</a> said it would help people who were at risk of defaulting on their mortgage payments, locked into extremely high interest rates, or owed more money on their mortgage than the value of their home. Now, Deutsche has taken some time to think that pledge over and has decided <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-15/deutsche-bank-reverses-pledge-to-help-distressed-homeowners\">not to go through with it at all</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deutsche Bank AG has decided that none of the more than $4 billion it promised to spend on consumer relief after the global mortgage crisis will go to distressed U.S. homeowners, according to a report by the monitor of the 2017 settlement. Instead, the consumer-relief money will be spent on originating new loans, according to the February 13 report by the bank’s monitor, <strong>Michael Bresnick.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The change in plans “may disappoint distressed homeowners and others, including the many individuals who have reached out to the monitor over the past two years, hoping to receive different types of consumer relief from the bank,” Bresnick wrote in the report, which was posted online.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The report did not go on to say “sorry, but them’s the breaks,” though clearly that‘s what is trying to be expressed here. In a statement, Deutsche said “As reported by the monitor, we have decided to focus our efforts on helping people purchase homes as the most efficient and effective way of delivering consumer relief given current market conditions and our financing expertise.”</p>\n<p><strong>How are the U.S. trade talks going with China?</strong></p>\n<p>If you ask White House National Economic Council director <strong>Larry Kudlow,</strong> they’re a regular night at Studio 54. “They’re covering all the ground. They’re hard at it. They’re just soldiering on. The vibe is good,” Kudlow <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2186292/us-china-trade-talks-good-vibes-and-laughter-venue-rivals-work\">told</a> reporters on Thursday. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/business/trump-china-us-trade.html\">On the other hand</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>. . . significant differences remain in the trade talks, and it is unclear whether they can be resolved, people briefed on the negotiations said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The most difficult and intractable issue involves the Trump administration’s desire to put meaningful restrictions on China’s ability to keep investing enormous sums of money from the government, and from government-affiliated financial institutions, in a wide range of advanced manufacturing sectors that compete with American industries. These include areas like commercial aircraft manufacturing, semiconductors, and artificial intelligence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Earlier this week, Trump said he might let the March 2 deadline, at which point tariffs on Chinese goods will increase from 10 to 25 percent, “slide for a little while” if progress was being made. He’s presumably stuck between wanting to please Wall Street&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/trump-admits-his-incredible-deal-with-china-is-bullshit\">as he has done in the past with bold, easily debunked lies</a>&#8212;and dragging out the drama for the next two weeks like the economy is a contestant on <em>The Apprentice.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>Trump’s “National Emergency” Speech Was a Rambling Mess (<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-national-emergency-declaration-wall\">The Hive</a></p>\n<p><strong>Eric Trump</strong> Blames Democrats for Ruining His Plans to Profit Off the Presidency (<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/eric-trump-blames-democrats-for-ruining-his-plans\">The Hive</a>)</p>\n<p>The Federal Debt Is Rising.

ahead, the musician reflects on the beauty-blogger phenomenon, her Gucci perfume campaign, and why disposable culture has her chasing that “forever feel.”","body":"<p>When has Los Angeles lore not been in fashion? As the Chateau Marmont earns its nonagenarian stripes this month, that “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/secrets-of-the-chateau-marmont\">high-thread-count clubhouse</a>” lives on as the nexus of Hollywood’s foibles and fascinations. In 2011, when the ingenue <strong>Lana Del Rey</strong> released the single “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE6wxDqdOV0\">Video Games</a>,” the music video shimmered with vintage footage of the property. Years later, Gucci’s <strong>Alessandro Michele</strong> took his own deep dive into Marmont memorabilia, turning out logo-embossed satchels and reimagined laundry bags for his Cruise 2019 collection. “It’s possible that no hotel in America inspires so much nostalgia, speculation, and sheer devotion,” writes <strong>Mark Rozzo</strong> in the 2019 Hollywood Issue of <em>Vanity Fair.</em> It’s not a surprise that Del Rey and Michele are fans.</p>\n<p>This time, the musician and the designer are coming together for a different kind of rewind&#8212;back to an era of body-hugging jumpsuits and sparkling laundromats, hairspray and patchouli-tinged perfume&#8212;to launch the campaign for <a href=\"https://www.macys.com/shop/product/gucci-guilty-pour-femme-eau-de-parfum-3.3-oz.?ID=7996939\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gucci Guilty</a>. Del Rey, the face of the his-and-hers fragrance alongside <strong>Jared Leto,</strong> recalls meeting Michele early into his Gucci tenure. “He told me that he had been putting together a lot of his collections while listening to my music,” she says in a call from rainy Los Angeles. “Needless to say, I was definitely flattered!”</p>\n<p>The campaign has a big-screen flair, with locations ranging from a classic diner to a nondescript supermarket (a roaming ostrich notwithstanding). The glamour&#8212;like the hair, styled by <strong>Paul Hanlon</strong>&#8212;is dialed way, way up. “We hadn’t really been thinking about nostalgia but just something that had a forever feel,” she says, likening the shoot to her recent Super 8-style music videos. “If you can mix that sensibility with a modern one”&#8212;Gucci’s mission in a nutshell&#8212;“you know you’re doing it right.”</p>\n<p>Here, Del Rey, whose sixth album, <em>Norman Fucking Rockwell,</em> is out later this year, unpacks that loaded title, laughs about the slow-dance lesson with a teenage crush, and talks up her version of self-care.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Vanity Fair:</em> The title of your new album brings to mind a certain classic vision of America. What was your headspace like for this record?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Lana Del Rey:</em> It was weird how that actual title came to me. I was riffing over a couple of chords that <strong>Jack [Antonoff]</strong> was playing for the title track, which ended up being called “Norman Fucking Rockwell.” It was kind of an exclamation mark: so this is the American dream, right now. This is where we’re at&#8212;Norman fucking Rockwell. We’re going to go to Mars, and <strong>[Donald] Trump</strong> is president, all right. Me and Jack, we just joke around constantly about all the random headlines we might see that week, so it’s a slight cultural reference. But it’s not a cynical thing, really. To me, it’s hopeful, to see everything as a little bit funnier. The chaos of the culture is interesting, and I’m hopeful that there’s room for there to be some movement and excitement within it.</p>\n<p><strong>There’s a line in “Video Games” about “[putting] his favorite perfume on”&#8212;a reminder that scent is as much a public performance as a private gesture. Do you have a relationship to it?</strong></p>\n<p>I love fragrance. I was always hesitant about being a crossover person, like a singer-slash-whatever. But if I had had less reservations, I [might have created] my own fragrance before I became the face of one. I didn’t want to do it in a big way&#8212;just for my own fans to enjoy. But I really do like fragrance. Being in L.A., you can tell the change of seasons depending on what flowers you can smell in the air. And I like the pink pepper and the peach [in Gucci Guilty]&#8212;very light, but a little spicy, which I think makes it easier to wear every day. In that way, it kind of reminds me of something I would have liked when I was a little bit younger. When I was in middle school, me and [my] cousins would go down to Bath &amp; Body Works and get an apple perfume, with one note, or a vanilla roller. It was thrilling. I still like a one-note perfume. Even if I’m putting on a Hawaiian Tropic suntan lotion, I like the smell of a little coconut. Or a rosewater spray.</p>\n<p><strong>Was there chemistry between you and Jared Leto, as subjects in this strange fantasy world in the Gucci campaign?</strong></p>\n<p>We work pretty differently. He’s been acting for so long that it’s very easy for him to just come in and off the set, but I like to hang out with the crew and Alessandro and see if they were shooting an ostrich [laughs]. So no, I didn’t get to pretend that I was with my old crush from <em>My So-Called Life</em>&#8212;although I did have one moment where we were supposed to be slow-dancing in the laundromat. I freaked out because I forgot how to do that for some reason. He was really nice and taught me how to dance again, so that was our most couple-ish moment.</p>\n<p><strong>The old-school hair salon appears in so many classic movie scenes. Did it bring up certain associations for you?</strong></p>\n<p>I spent years putting my hair into wet sets, so I’ve sat under those giant hoods myself. I’m sure I loved them at one point, but I just hate them now! I’d put my hair into rollers, dry them into curls, and then brush them out, so it was like a big Texas triangle. I would do that like every four days, if I was playing shows or for little appearances. Now I put it into braids and hope for the best!</p>\n<p><strong>Those curl sets were all about glamour. What do you make of the beauty upkeep of the Instagram age? Is there a kinship with midcentury perfectionism?</strong></p>\n<p>Totally. I find myself on random beauty-blogger pages, and I have no idea how I got there, watching a cat eye. All of the girls with those perfect pictures&#8212;you know, I don’t hate it. I totally see the connection between that old 50s Hollywood glamour and whatever you want to call what’s going on now. There’s definitely a modern, heightened take.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you imagine yourself playing a character while you were shooting the campaign?</strong></p>\n<p>I was stressing a little bit because I was hopping out of my Lululemon leggings and Ugg boots and getting into my jumpsuit&#8212;and getting into a lot of hair, a lot of makeup, which I love doing. But I feel like my at-home weirdness is very normal-looking, so it was almost uncomfortable to be outwardly in diamonds at the grocery store! But that was the point: wouldn’t it be funny if these two people just lived every day like this? I told [Alessandro] that’s how everyone in L.A. is. They’re at Erewhon with their diamonds on.</p>\n<p><strong>Just the title of the song “Venice Bitch” calls to mind a juice-drinking Erewhon habitué. Do you eye-roll at L.A.’s wellness scene, or are you into it?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh, yeah&#8212;I’m that girl. I’m at Erewhon; I’m in yoga classes. I love L.A. for that reason. I’m so lucky that when Jack or <strong>Rick [Nowels]</strong> are in town, I get to work, but it’s such a blessing for me to be able to run down the street somewhere on La Brea and go to the DEN Meditation or do a spin class. You could literally go on every corner and find some type of deep-breathwork class. I do all that stuff, so yeah: Venice bitch [laughs].</p>\n<p><strong>What do you consider your main form of self-care?</strong></p>\n<p>I could sum it up in one word: girlfriends. I see my friends every day; I’m in coffee shops for hours talking to them. It’s just pretty simple&#8212;not isolating and planning little things. For me, because I’m a really sensitive person, surrounding myself with a gentle personality type&#8212;which is the rarer type&#8212;that’s my biggest form of self-care. And the rest kind of falls into place.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The dirty truth about <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/the-dirty-secret-of-el-chapo-downfall?inline\">El Chapo’s downfall</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; That time <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/brian-rea-modern-love-death-wins-a-goldfish?inline\">death took a break</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The 25 <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/25-best-movie-scenes?inline\">most influential movie scenes</a> of the past 25 years</p>\n<p>&#8212; Acupuncture and hypno-birthing?

national-security secrets.","promoDek":"Jared Kushner isn’t the only Trump official who got a special pass after security experts said he shouldn’t be allowed to access national-security secrets.","body":"<p>In May, after months working under an interim clearance, <strong>Jared Kushner’s</strong> request for a permanent security clearance, which would allow him to see top-secret material, was finally granted. At the time, observers took this as an indication that <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> son-in-law, who’d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jared-kushner-now-a-focus-in-russia-investigation/2017/05/25/f078db74-40c7-11e7-8c25-44d09ff5a4a8_story.html\">reportedly</a> attracted <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> attention for his ties to various foreign entities, was in the clear. On Thursday, however, an NBC News <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/officials-rejected-jared-kushner-top-secret-security-clearance-were-overruled-n962221\">report</a> threw that conclusion into doubt. In fact, two sources familiar with the matter told the outlet, Kushner’s clearance was only approved because Trump’s handpicked director of security personnel overruled two career White House security specialists, who had recommended against Kushner receiving top-secret clearance after seeing the results of his F.B.I. background check.</p>\n<p>Kushner’s case represents a worrisome pattern for the White House. Per NBC, Trump’s director of security, <strong>Carl Kline,</strong> overruled security experts in at least 30 cases, recommending that Trump officials be granted clearances despite troubling information uncovered in their background checks. (The sources noted that the Trump White House “attracted many people with untraditional backgrounds who had complicated financial and personal histories, some of which raised red flags.”) That number is indeed extraordinary. Prior to the Trump administration, White House security experts had only been overruled <em>once</em> in the past three years. (The White House told NBC, “We don’t comment on security clearances.” A C.I.A. spokesman said the same, and Kushner’s lawyer, <strong>Abbe Lowell,</strong> had “no comment.” Kline, a former Pentagon employee, could not be reached for comment.)</p>\n<p>Denying a security clearance to a White House official, noted <strong>Daniel Jacobson,</strong> a former lawyer in <strong>Barack Obama’s</strong> administration, is not something that’s done lightly. “It is not normal for the head of the Personal Security Office to ever overrule the career employees who adjudicate clearances,” he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dan_F_Jacobson/status/1088614823859023872\">wrote</a> on Twitter. “It takes some pretty bad stuff to be denied a clearance. The fact that there have been thirty denial recommendations of WH staff in the last 1.5 years is itself crazy, before you even get to the overruling part.”</p>\n<p>After he was cleared by the White House, Kushner’s file was reportedly submitted to the C.I.A. to be evaluated for an S.C.I., or “sensitive compartmented information” clearance&#8212;an even higher designation. It didn’t go well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After reviewing the file, C.I.A. officers who make clearance decisions balked, two of the people familiar with the matter said. One called over to the White House security division, wondering how Kushner got even a top-secret clearance, the sources said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given his various entanglements, the C.I.A.’s alarm makes sense. As <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/kushners-overseas-contacts-raise-concerns-as-foreign-officials-seek-leverage/2018/02/27/16bbc052-18c3-11e8-942d-16a950029788_story.html\">reported last year</a>, the president’s son-in-law is viewed by several foreign countries&#8212;the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, China, and Israel among them&#8212;as a potentially manipulable asset, given his fraught business dealings and his notable lack of political experience. Along with his communications with Russia during the transition, which <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/jared-kushner-russia-investigation-robert-mueller-mike-flynn-cnn-1246401\">caught Mueller’s attention</a>, Kushner helped <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90233994/how-a-secret-seychelles-meeting-signaled-the-uae-pull-in-trump-d-c\">establish a back channel</a> with the U.A.E. while <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/03/02/jared-kushner-real-estate-qatar-blockade/\">supporting a blockade against Qatar</a>, and has maintained a close personal friendship with Saudi Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/saudi-arabia-united-arab-emirates-jared-kushner-robert-mueller\">reportedly bragged</a> last spring that he had Kushner “in his pocket” after Kushner allegedly turned over a list of Saudi dissidents being monitored by the U.S. (Kushner’s team has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/russia-isnt-the-only-country-with-its-hooks-in-jared-kushner\">called</a> this allegation “obviously false and ridiculous”; shortly after the gruesome death of Jamal Khashoggi, Kushner apparently became a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/world/middleeast/saudi-mbs-jared-kushner.html\">reliable defender of the crown prince</a> within the White House.)</p>\n<p>Presumably, some or all of these dealings factored into career officials’ recommendation that Kushner be denied a security clearance. “They would not do that lightly for someone of Kushner’s stature and position,” Jacobson wrote. “The fact that the C.I.A. then denied his S.C.I. application is equally damning,” he added. “And the fact that they were so disturbed by the granting of his [top secret] clearance that they called over to the WH? Hooboy.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The family drama surrounding <a

The choice made sense. Clinton was the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, traversing battleground states to shore up voters and delegates and sell the exact kinds of qualities that would make someone among Americans’ most respected people. That this was the 20th time that Clinton topped the list&#8212;since 1993&#8212;is a testament to the role she has played in the modern fabric of American politics. (Only Eleanor Roosevelt, with 13 years atop the list, and Margaret Thatcher, who bested the rest six times, come close to Clinton’s Gallup reign.)\n<p>To be sure, there are a good many Americans who do not feel such affection for Clinton. As First Lady for eight years, she forgave her husband, Bill, for cheating with an intern, covering up the affair, and being impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice. After the Clintons left the White House for New York, she voted in favor of the Iraq war&#8212;a decision that has since raised questions about her hawkish judgement. She lost her 2008 bid for the White House, which some assumed she’d win handily, to a first-term community organizer turned senator from Chicago. And when that newcomer took office as the 44th president and named her secretary of state, she hosted her work e-mails on a private server and took responsibility for a 2012 security breach in Benghazi that led to the death of four Americans.</p>\n<p>But the Wellesley- and Yale-educated lawyer, champion for women’s rights, advocate for children, and well-regarded glass-ceiling smasher finally seems as though she is headed back to the Oval Office, on her own terms. After a drawn-out primary process with Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton appears to have locked up enough super-delegates to win the nomination.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/574325b6614dc9a45cb0a2b0_hive-contributor-profile-hillary-clinton.jpg","width":1400,"height":700},"16:9":{"width":1232,"height":693,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":84,"width":1232,"height":693}}},"9:16":{"width":387,"height":688,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":506,"width":387,"height":688}}},"1:1":{"width":700,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":350,"width":700,"height":700}}},"3:2":{"width":1050,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":350,"height":700,"width":1050}}},"2:3":{"width":466,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":467,"width":466,"height":699}}},"4:3":{"width":932,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":234,"width":932,"height":699}}},"5:3":{"width":1165,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":117,"width":1165,"height":699}}},"7:3":{"width":1400,"height":600,"modifications":{"crop":{"width":1400,"height":600}}}},"revisionCreatedAt":"July 25, 2017 1:45 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Aminata Dia","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-hillary-clinton.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-hillary-clinton.jpg","tags":[],"credit":"By Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574325b5c1f81aa45c8117d7","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 11:45 am","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"July 25, 2017 1:45 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 513012906","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/hillary-clinton","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/574325b6614dc9a45cb0a2b0_hive-contributor-profile-hillary-clinton.jpg","width":1400,"height":700},"16:9":{"width":1232,"height":693,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":84,"width":1232,"height":693}}},"9:16":{"width":387,"height":688,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":506,"width":387,"height":688}}},"1:1":{"width":700,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":350,"width":700,"height":700}}},"3:2":{"width":1050,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":350,"height":700,"width":1050}}},"2:3":{"width":466,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":467,"width":466,"height":699}}},"4:3":{"width":932,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":234,"width":932,"height":699}}},"5:3":{"width":1165,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":117,"width":1165,"height":699}}},"7:3":{"width":1400,"height":600,"modifications":{"crop":{"width":1400,"height":600}}}},"revisionCreatedAt":"July 25, 2017 1:45 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Aminata Dia","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-hillary-clinton.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-hillary-clinton.jpg","tags":[],"credit":"By Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574325b5c1f81aa45c8117d7","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 11:45 am","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"July 25, 2017 1:45 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 513012906","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"5743260055f979a31fa98971","revision":4,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/hillary-clinton"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"“Take Her at Her Word”: Hillary Allies Address the 2020 Rumors","promoHed":"“Take Her at Her Word”: Hillary Allies Address the 2020 Rumors","dek":"John Podesta offers more “media catnip.”","promoDek":"John Podesta offers more “media catnip.”","body":"<p>In October, <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> told <strong>Kara Swisher</strong> she would “like to be president,” spawning <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/us/politics/hillary-clinton-run-president.html\">dozens of headlines</a> in publications that gamed out the viability of a potential 2020 bid. To hear the press tell it, she was “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/well-id-like-to-be-president-hillary-clinton-sends-mixed-signals-on-a-2020-white-house-bid/2018/10/29/d17257a0-db6c-11e8-85df-7a6b4d25cfbb_story.html\">sending mixed signals</a>,” and “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/413572-hillary-clinton-leaves-door-open-for-2020-run-id-like-to-be-president\">leaving the door open</a>,” characterizations Swisher herself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1056924474367533059\">took issue with</a>. Yet for some reason, rumors continue to swirl around Clinton, inspired by an errant word from a longtime adviser <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/10/19/hillary-clinton-democrats-go-away-2018-2020-221608\">here</a>, a trolling <em>Wall Street Journal</em> op-ed <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-will-run-again-1541963599?ns=prod/accounts-wsj\">there</a>. Most recently, CNN’s <strong>Jeff Zeleny</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/27/politics/inside-politics-forecast-cnntv/index.html\">reported</a> on that Clinton was once again floating a candidacy to her friends: “[S]he was telling people that look, given all this news from the indictments, particularly the <strong>Roger Stone</strong> indictment, she talked to several people, saying ‘look, I’m not closing the doors to this,’” he said, adding that other associates still were dubious. (Said one: “it would surprise me greatly if she actually did it.”)</p>\n<p>This, said <strong>John Podesta,</strong> Clinton’s 2016 campaign manager, is nonsense. “Look, first of all, I love her, I wish she was president, she got 3 million more votes than <strong>Donald Trump</strong> did, she would have been a great president,” he <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2020-presidential-election-hillary-clinton-not-running-podesta-070ef325-dd68-480e-98ea-99ebd619d047.html\">said</a> on CNN Tuesday. “But she says she’s not running for president.”</p>\n<p>“I take her at her word,” he continued, adding that the Democratic Party has “got a lot of great candidates out there right now, and I think the Democratic primary”&#8212;already a crowded affair&#8212;”is going to be a spirited one with a lot of great ideas coming forward.” He dismissed the narrative that Clinton was mulling another presidential run as “media catnip.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, there seems to be something irresistible to the media in the idea of Clinton resurfacing. Perhaps it’s simply difficult to imagine that arguably the most qualified candidate to ever run for president is content at the prospect of spending her days <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/deals/gl-lnc-the-clintons-la-2019\">selling speaking tour tickets on Groupon</a>, or even, as Podesta described, visiting Puerto Rico to “help the people that Donald Trump has abandoned” as the island recovers from Hurricane Maria. Whatever the reason, each new story in the genre is met with an inevitable backlash. The response to the <em>Journal</em> op-ed is a prime example: “Please, Hillary, Don’t Do It,” two CNN contributors <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/opinions/hillary-2020-prospect-opinion-honan-wierson/index.html\">wrote in panicked response</a>, while <strong>Chris Cilizza</strong> devoted <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T9hcFrD6Ns\">six-and-a-half minutes</a> to calling it a “terrible idea,” and <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/no-hillary-clinton-wont-be-the-2020-democratic-nominee.html\">countless</a> <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/a-request-to-mark-penn-andy-stein-and-any-other-so-called-democrats-talking-up-clinton-2020-respectfully-shut-up\">hot</a> <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/807216/hillary-2020-cannot-serious\">takes</a> <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/418137-foxs-pirro-to-clinton-on-2020-the-only-place-that-you-need-to-run-is-back-into\">emerged</a> panning possibility. (The one exception was Trump White House adviser <strong>Kellyanne Conway,</strong> who tweeted: <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/conway-jokes-about-prediction-hillary-clinton-will-run-again-in-2020-1.6640531\">“Dear God, please, yes.”</a>)</p>\n<p>But the myth of Clinton as leader-in-exile will persist as long as she remains a public figure, buoyed both by people who believe she would’ve won in 2016 save for a few targeted Russian hacks, and by those who see rumors about her potential run as a characteristic display of unalloyed ambition and hubris. The Clinton persona has become symbolic of the rift in the Democratic Party that paved the way for Trumpism, and rumors of her return are all but guaranteed to trigger meltdowns.</p>\n<h3>More Great

But that doesn’t mean that no woman will pass it, or that disliking a certain woman stems solely from misogyny.","body":"<p>From time to time, the political press propagates a thought that, whatever its validity, dominates the discourse. It’s akin to a spontaneous combustion, and the truism it produces lasts until the next one comes along. As in: <strong>Amy Klobuchar’s</strong> two-and-a-half-minute exchange with <strong>Brett Kavanaugh</strong> about his drinking habits gave instant rise to the widespread conclusion that she should be the Democratic nominee.</p>\n<p>And no sooner had <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> entered the race in late December than the question of whether she’s “likable” was immediately interpreted as misogynistic.</p>\n<p>Warren’s talents as a campaigner were evident in her foray into Iowa during the first week of January. She’s quite skilled at drilling down to a simple, comprehensible point, usually having to do with economic justice. Her anecdotes go over well. For example, in Iowa she told the story of getting in touch with Iowa Republican Senator <strong>Chuck Grassley,</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/bipartisan-over-the-counter-hearing-aid-legislation-to-become-law\">working with him</a> to get a bill through Congress that lowered the cost of hearing aids. (Cheers and applause.) She’s earned bragging rights for having spawned the idea&#8212;before she entered the Senate&#8212;of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to protect individuals from scams in credit cards, mortgages, and loans. The new agency was relatively successful, until the Trump administration took over and began to de-fang it.</p>\n<p>But there’s another aspect to Warren’s economic populism&#8212;one that makes her less than popular among her Senate colleagues. This friction has nothing to do with Warren being a woman in politics, or displaying political ambition&#8212;just as much of what bothered people about <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> had nothing to do with her gender. For an explanation of what it is about Warren that perturbs her colleagues, I sought out an observant former Senate Democratic aide of many years’ standing. What he said echoed comments and stories I’d heard from senators and reporters who’ve dealt with Warren. “She projects a ‘holier than thou’ attitude that her colleagues find irritating. She’s very doctrinaire. She’s somewhat ‘My way or the highway’&#8212;not as much as <strong>Bernie Sanders,</strong> but up there,” he said. “She has a moralizing to her . . . She rails against Wall Street, which may be appealing to some people, but it’s too simplistic to work as an analysis. But she’s very good at finding issues that resonate with middle Americans,” he added, citing the hearing-aid story. He went on: “She’s a little aloof; she’s strong in her convictions, unwilling to bend.”</p>\n<p>He then offered a comparison between Warren and Clinton as senators. Of Warren he said, “She’s never tried very hard to make friends there. Compare that to Hillary: She knew coming into the Senate that she was viewed by many there as the devil incarnate, and she kept her head down and worked to make friends on both sides of the aisle.”</p>\n<p>Of course, despite her best efforts, the “unlikable” tag has also been attached to Clinton. What bothered many people (women, as well as men) about Clinton was that she gave off an attitude of entitlement&#8212;the tin ear and air of superiority that led her to label half of <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> supporters “a basket of deplorables.” That misogyny dogged Clinton is without question, but some of her own personality traits were responsible for the way she was seen by a substantial segment of the public.</p>\n<p>The fact that Warren’s likability, like Clinton’s, has been questioned has led numerous observers to conclude that no woman in politics can overcome criticism based on her gender. That’s nonsense. After all, a <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/12/18/record-number-women-in-congress/\">record</a> 102 women were elected to the House of Representatives in 2018. (The previous House record was 85 women.) Republicans simply haven’t made the same effort that Democrats have to bring women into their ranks, with the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/12/18/record-number-women-in-congress/\">result</a> that women now represent 8 percent of House Republicans, as opposed to 38 percent of the Democratic caucus. (Democrats also stressed diversity, and sought out candidates of both genders who’d served in the military.) In the Senate, midterms plus the appointment to fill the remainder of John McCain’s term, added 15 women, for a total of 25 women senators; previously, the <a href=\"http://cawp.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/resources/results_release_5bletterhead5d_1.pdf\">record</a> was 23. Two incumbent women senators lost to men on clear substantive issues. Midterms also saw women pick up gubernatorial seats, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/opinion/election-michigan-women-stabenow-whitmer.html\">four of the top statewide offices</a> in Michigan. A black woman fell just short of winning the governorship of Georgia, overtaken at least in part by the fact that her opponent was also the secretary of state who set and twisted the rules of the race. The direction is clear. A country that couldn’t see women through other than a misogynistic lens wouldn’t produce such results.</p>\n<p>Another way to look at Warren’s situation in Congress is to compare it to that of <strong>Nancy Pelosi,</strong> as House Speaker far and away the most powerful woman on Capitol Hill, if not in all of Washington. Despite the attacks on her in national politics&#8212;the right charges her with being a “San Francisco liberal,” though in fact she’s a product of the brass-knuckle politics of Baltimore, where her father was the boss-mayor&#8212;Pelosi’s colleagues don’t raise the issue of her likability. Under pressure from their Republican opponents, some Democrats running for the House for the first time pledged not to support her for Speaker (though not all of them held to this promise). But no serious challenge developed. It was clear, as she skillfully dispatched possible rivals&#8212;who said it was time for fresh blood in the Democratic leadership&#8212;that Pelosi is admired by most of the men as well as the women in the Democratic caucus for her legislative smarts and her toughness wrapped in a certain grace. Several said that Pelosi was just who was needed to deal with Donald Trump. She met the argument of those who said she should make way for younger leadership by agreeing to step down from the Speakership after four more years. The contrasting cases of Warren and Pelosi show that people&#8212;both men and women&#8212;are capable of making distinctions among women in politics.</p>\n<p>The question arises: What does likability matter in politics? Does it&#8212;should it&#8212;matter at all, if someone can get elected? In fact, it counts for a lot in determining whether a political figure can work effectively with others&#8212;whether she or he can build coalitions&#8212;or can lead the public. A politician whom large numbers of people find grating simply has a harder time leading the country. This is one reason I don’t complain about the length of presidential campaigns: It usually helps sort out who will wear well. Usually. The fact that Trump is disliked by a majority of the country has been one factor getting in the way of his possible effectiveness.</p>\n<p>It’s undeniable that, while women have been making headlong progress in politics, as well as in some other professional fields, they still carry an extra burden. The double standard still exists: A man who speaks out strongly or objects to something a male boss has done is “strong,” “tough.” A woman who does the same thing is likely to be termed “difficult.” That word, “difficult,” stated or insinuated, haunts women in the workplace. Fortunately, an increasing proportion of men have enough inner strength or are sufficiently enlightened that they deal with women the same way they do men. Sexism in the workplace and in politics may be fading, but not quickly enough.</p>\n<p>At least for a while longer, women in certain fields will endure a different kind of test than men do&#8212;or an additional one. But that doesn’t mean that no woman will pass it, that it’s the only test applied to women candidates, that people can’t make distinctions, or that disliking a certain woman stems solely from misogyny. Nor does it mean that, like men, women can’t find a female candidate wanting on other grounds.</p>\n<p>Misogyny can certainly affect women in politics, but they’ll also be judged on other factors on a case-by-case basis. Other female candidates warming up for the race warrant scrutiny for other traits. Ultimately, candidates of both genders must grapple with the valid question of “likability,” which will help answer a far more important question: How will they govern?</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The real story behind the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/the-real-story-behind-the-havana-embassy-mystery?inline\">Havana embassy sonic “attacks”</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Meet 2019’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/politics-power-players-portfolio?inline\">political power players</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is the left lane big enough for both <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/why-bernie-sanders-and-elizabeth-warren-are-the-closest-of-frenemies?inline\">Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; What the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/what-the-left-can-learn-from-the-maga-cult?inline\">left can learn from MAGA</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The pop-culture releases that will <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/pop-culture-shows-movies-2019?inline\">save us in 2019</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Elizabeth Warren","socialTitle":"“She Has a Moralizing to Her”: Is Elizabeth Warren Actually “Unlikeable?”","socialDescription":"Women in certain fields endure a different kind of test than men do—or an additional one.

Unlike <strong>Corey Lewandowski,</strong> who was hired to great consternation during the 2016 election cycle (and then terminated), Flores won’t simply be an ideological talking head&#8212;she’ll be playing a larger role in the editorial process. Despite a lack of journalism experience, she will <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/media/reliable-sources-02-19-19/\">be helping</a> to coordinate CNN’s political coverage across platforms, as well as <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/19/sessions-sarah-isgur-cnn-political-editor-1174527\">occasionally appearing on-air</a> as a political analyst, which is the more customary role for former politicians and government officials. Within the media world, she is seen as a controversial and unorthodox appointment. Moreover, Isgur apparently has a history of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/19/18231993/cnn-gop-operative-2020-election-coverage\">lambasting the mainstream media</a> on Twitter, including CNN, which she once termed the “Clinton News Network.”</p>\n<p>All of this has led to a fair amount of bafflement as to why CNN would hire her in a senior editorial role reporting to political director <strong>David Chalian.</strong> “Why CNN made this move to begin with is the deeper and more troubling question,” <strong>Margaret Sullivan</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/cnns-hiring-of-a-gop-operative-as-political-editor-is-even-worse-than-it-looks/2019/02/20/93d03fa4-350b-11e9-854a-7a14d7fec96a_story.html\">wrote</a> Wednesday in <em>The Washington Post.</em></p>\n<p>As far as how the talks came about in the first place, it appears that Isgur, as she was preparing to exit the D.O.J., wasn’t only shopping around for a media gig at CNN. Cable-news sources told me that she also passed through 30 Rock to discuss a potential role at MSNBC, where she met with top newsroom management in recent months. “She had a detailed idea of what she wanted to do,” someone with knowledge of the discussions told me. “She wanted to do something on-air combined with some sort of quasi-management, behind-the-scenes planning kind of work. I think she looked at Dave Chalian and said, I wanna do that.” A second source with direct knowledge of the talks said that such a role “was never under consideration.” This person added, “She was pitching her intimate knowledge of the Mueller probe as a selling point.” (CNN has said that Isgur will have no role in any coverage related to Mueller or the Department of Justice.) MSNBC declined to comment, and CNN didn’t immediately have a comment. Isgur didn’t immediately return an e-mail, but after this article was initially published, a source close to her provided a different characterization, saying that anything related to Mueller was always off the table in Isgur&#39;s conversations with both MSNBC and CNN.</p>\n<p>My CNN sources corroborated the general sentiment that’s been conveyed in <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/media/reliable-sources-02-19-19/\">other</a> news <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnn-staffers-demoralized-by-hiring-of-gop-operative-sarah-isgur-to-oversee-2020-coverage\">reports</a> about the episode: that journalists at the network are concerned and confused about the hire. “It’s perplexing to a lot of people,” one of them told me. But in a <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnn-defends-hiring-former-gop-operative-as-political-editor\">memo</a> to employees on Wednesday, three top CNN managers&#8212;Chalian, Washington bureau chief <strong>Sam Feist,</strong> and senior vice president of newsgathering <strong>Virginia Mosley</strong>&#8212;stood by the decision, saying they were “thrilled” that Isgur was joining the network next month. “With more than two dozen candidates to cover, constant coordination is needed more than ever,” they wrote.</p>\n<p>Likewise, unnamed CNN executives defended the move to <strong>Brian Stelter,</strong> the network’s chief media correspondent. “They described her [as] an exceptional person whose political experience will improve CNN’s coverage,” Stelter <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/media/reliable-sources-02-19-19/\">wrote</a>. “The fact is, political insiders have been joining newsrooms for decades. The executives pointed to past examples like <strong>George Stephanopoulos,</strong> who went from [the] Clinton White House to the ABC News anchor chair.” A CNN source added to me, “She is super-smart, has experience in the media, is a spokesperson who understands the media&#8212;seems like these are all good characteristics.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity

Boyz II Men’s “End of the Road” spent 13 weeks at the top of the Billboard charts, teens looked to Seattle for fashion inspiration, and <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> claimed he didn’t inhale. Yes, looking back, it’s hard to believe, both the Seattle thing and the fact that a presidential hopeful admitted he tried a marijuana cigarette during his youth&#8212;but claimed the smoke never hit his lungs.</p>\n<p>That was more than a quarter-century ago. Sometimes progress looks like a heart monitor attached to a healthy human&#8212;up and back, up and back, ever forward, never changing. But here now, in 2019, a presidential hopeful can say, “Of course.” Of course she inhaled. And she can say it while laughing a lot with an incredibly popular radio host on an incredibly popular morning show.</p>\n<p>When asked Monday morning about her youthful weed consumption on <em>The Breakfast Club,</em> Senator <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> told D.J. <strong>Charlamagne tha God,</strong> “I joke about it&#8212;half my family is from Jamaica, are you kidding me?” she said, referring to her father’s relatives, near the end of her 40-minute interview. “And I inhaled,” she said, giggling. “I did inhale. It was a long time ago,” adding later, “I think it gives a lot of people joy. We need more joy in the world.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed block video row\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><iframe height=\"315\" width=\"560\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kh_wQUjeaTk\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"> </iframe></div></div><p>Many people in elected posts have copped to using marijuana.

Obama said at a conference for magazine editors in 2008, “When I was a kid, I inhaled frequently. That was the point.” Even human bunion <strong>Newt Gingrich</strong> has said as much: “That was a sign we were alive and in graduate school in that era [circa 1968].” Rather than just seeking “thank you for your candor” points, however, Harris is normalizing use of the drug in an effort to legalize it. In 2017, Harris backed the Marijuana Justice Act, which fellow presidential candidate Senator <strong>Cory Booker</strong> introduced.</p>\n<p>Booker himself broke some news on <em>The Breakfast Club</em> last week. When asking about whether the senator has a girlfriend, Charlamagne was able to extract the words “I got a boo” from the senator, a reference to his <a href=\"https://people.com/politics/cory-booker-says-he-has-a-girlfriend/\">secretly-not-secret girlfriend, <strong>Rosario Dawson</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The host is also credited with getting one of the most genuinely delightful interviews from <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> during her presidential campaign. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/18/hillary-clinton-joins-the-breakfast-club-to-talk-beyonce-hot-sauce-in-her-bag-swag/?utm_term=.8e27e77c2483\">In April 2016</a>, he playfully accused her of “pandering to black people” by claiming to carry hot sauce in her bag for years. “Is it working?” she asked.

latest episode of <em>True Detective</em> online a little early. You can watch Season 3, Episode 5, “If You Have Ghosts,” on HBO Go and other streaming platforms right now. But just make sure you are all caught up before you dive into the latest theory here, because it involves some very important revelations from the latest hour. You can listen to our full dive into the episode, including an interview with cast member <strong>Scoot McNairy,</strong> on the most recent episode of <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s podcast <a href=\"https://megaphone.link/PPY3889133426\"><em>Still Watching: True Detective.</em></a></p>\n<p>But if you’re not ready to listen to that or read the latest theory on whodunnit, we’ll throw up a little warning until you get a chance to watch Episode 5. But we <em>can</em> tease that this latest development will take us all the way to the White House.</p>\n<p>Half the fun of wading into the complicated <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/true-detective-season-3-timeline\">timeline</a> of <em>True Detective</em> is analyzing the theories&#8212;half-baked though they may be. Earlier in the season, we were chasing a solution that was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/true-detective-who-is-the-killer-amelia-season-3-episode-3-the-big-never\">close to home</a> for the Hays family, but now something much more complicated and juicy has emerged. Enter: Gerald Kindt.</p>\n<h2>ARKANSAS ATTORNEY GENERAL GERALD KINDT</h2>\n<p>One of the most striking scenes in Episode 5 saw Tom Purcell hunched over what is likely a recording of his adult daughter, Julie. Taken at face value, the audio is damning to Tom. Julie accuses her father of hurting Will and taking her. But what does she <em>really</em> say?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I saw him on the television. Make him leave me alone. Tell him to\nleave me alone. I know what he did. The man on TV acting like my\nfather. Where’s my brother, Will? I don’t know what he did with him.\nWe left him resting. He took me and I’m never coming back. Just leave\nme alone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All season, <em>True Detective</em> has been fond of vague pronouns as misdirect to keep the audience guessing. Up until Episode 5, Brett Woodard was referred to as “a Man” in the 1990 timeline simply so we wouldn’t be able to track who was convicted in the Purcell case in 1990. Similarly, here, Julie (if that’s who it is) seems to be talking about Tom, but she <em>could</em> be talking about someone else she saw on the TV. She only says someone is <em>acting</em> like her father. In other words, she could be talking about Gerald Kindt.</p>\n<p>Is Kindt her real father? Not necessarily. Though who knows? We know Lucy slept around, we know the rumors about when Julie was born. But Julie was tiny when she was taken and it’s unclear what she remembers about her life before 1980. More important, there have been indications that someone on the law-and-order side of things has been tampering with the case, which brings us to . . .</p>\n<h2>OFFICER HARRIS JAMES</h2>\n<p>James gets name-dropped in this episode as someone who went missing when the case was reopened in 1990, and several clues&#8212;including a suspiciously familiar ghost in Wayne’s study&#8212;indicate that perhaps Wayne and Roland had something to do with his disappearance. In fact, the show is implying they killed him&#8212;we don’t know why. Most pertinently, Harris James is the officer on the scene at the Woodard house back in 1980 who makes the connection between a bright red backpack and Will Purcell. If the Purcell evidence <em>was</em> planted at the scene in the 80s, Harris could have easily been the one to do it.</p>\n<p>We also know that a key set of fingerprints has gone missing from the case file and a mysterious someone&#8212;either a real cop or someone impersonating one&#8212;has been making inquiries around the neighborhood. It feels likely that James would be acting on the orders of someone higher up, and who better to turn up the heat than a powerful man like Gerald Kindt. One more detail about the Harris angle: in the 2015 story line, Wayne and Roland discuss the fact that Hoyt came to visit Wayne (likely) after Harris James died. Which brings us to . . .</p>\n<h2>HOYT FOODS</h2>\n<p>It’s useful to think of real-world parallels when chewing over this next part, which links Attorney General Gerald Kindt to Lucy Purcell’s old employer: Hoyt Foods. This massive company, which seems to employ many of the Arkansas locals, is a clear stand-in for the real-life Tyson Foods. Both companies are based in Arkansas and got their start with chicken. Tyson Foods has been in the news a good deal lately for <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/01/29/tyson-chicken-recall-rubber-may-contaminate-nuggets-usda-says/2717993002/\">various</a> unsavory <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/poultry-workers-denied-bathroom-breaks-wear-diapers-oxfam-report-n572806\">reasons</a>, but the company was in the news a good deal in the late 70s, 80s, and 90s for its connection to Arkansas’s real attorney general-turned-president: <strong>Bill Clinton.</strong></p>\n<p>The show has already made a few connections between Kindt and Clinton. For one, Clinton <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bypWnBR47Rk\"><em>very</em> famously appeared</a> on <em>The Phil Donahue Show</em> in 1992 and self-righteously clutched his pearls when host <strong>Phil Donahue</strong> dared question the stability of the Clinton marriage. The would-be president got thunderous applause. Kindt also makes a <em>Donahue</em> appearance.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to be an expert in all things Clinton or Arkansas to know that the politician and the state enjoyed an especially messy entanglement between politics and big business in the 80s and 90s. (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/timeline.htm?noredirect=on\">Whitewater, anyone?</a>) Tyson Foods C.E.O. Don Tyson had a very cozy relationship with the Clintons. A 1992 <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/03/22/in-arkansas-the-game-is-chicken/6244e0fa-5416-4a6a-bae8-a229b854ed98/?utm_term=.fb189aeea3eb\">Washington Post</a></em> report opened with this evocative lede: “Don Tyson kills 25 million chickens a week on his assembly lines, 10 times as many birds as there are people in Arkansas.” Further down the page: “It would be an overstatement to say that Clinton and Tyson could not have succeeded without each other&#8212;for the most part their relationship has been of mutual benefit, helping Tyson expand his operations and Clinton ascend politically.” In 1994, <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/31/magazine/the-president-s-past.html\">The New York Times</a></em> further investigated the connection:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“[Clinton] was young and he was impressive,” Tyson recalls. “I don’t\nbelieve we ever talked about his politics; hell, he was a Democrat.”\nTyson put a modest sum of money on Clinton in his yearling race, a\ncongressional run in 1974. Although Clinton lost that election, he\nshowed excellent form, and Tyson backed him again in his successful\n1976 run for state attorney general; and again in 1978, when the\n32-year-old ran as the overwhelming favorite for governor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tyson’s support came with what appears to have been a lot of <a href=\"https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/02/02/Why-37-Year-Old-Clinton-Financial-Scandal-Still-Relevant\">leniency and kickbacks</a> from the Clinton administration and even messier entanglements including, what else, an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/18/us/top-arkansas-lawyer-helped-hillary-clinton-turn-big-profit.html\">investment scandal</a> for <strong>Hillary Clinton.</strong></p>\n<p>Before you start any silly “lock them up” chants, let’s focus back on <em>True Detective.</em> It’s safe to assume the show could easily connect the shadowy billionaire owner of Hoyt Foods with Gerald Kindt. And if he’s involved somehow, everything Hoyt has done so far to stymy both the 1980 investigation and the 1990 re-investigation makes sense. But what on earth is the motivation here?</p>\n<p>Some eagle-eyed Redditors noticed a connection between a portrait of Hoyt’s daughter and missing granddaughter in Episode 3 and a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZinAVMvdI8\">behind-the-scenes shot</a> of Devil’s Den in a video HBO released about shooting the show in Arkansas. It’s easy enough to imagine a scenario where Hoyt’s daughter&#8212;driven mad with grief over having lost her own daughter&#8212;might snatch Julie Purcell. Will would be collateral damage. Almost every investigator agrees Will’s death looked like an accident. Perhaps he cracked his head open trying to get his sister back. Perhaps Hoyt’s daughter lured Julie and Will into the woods with shiny toys, corn-husk dolls, and elaborate fantasies about being a secret princess. Perhaps this is the mysterious white woman many Arkansas locals spotted in a fancy brown car. Wouldn’t a chicken heiress drive a fancy car? But did she do it alone?</p>\n<h2>SAM WHITEHEAD</h2>\n<p>All reports of that shifty-looking white woman also mention a black man with a scar or “dead eye” along with her. When questioned about it, Sam brings up the killing line at Hoyt Foods as a likely place for someone to get injured. A one point, Wayne suggests they cross-reference the fingerprints found on the toys in the woods with the men who have been injured at Hoyt Foods. He might be onto something there. Hell, it might even be Sam himself. But that’s not all.</p>\n<h2>LUCY PURCELL</h2>\n<p>In this week’s episode, Wayne draws a connection between Lucy Purcell and the ransom note. Both use the phrase “children should laugh.” He suggests maybe she just wrote the ransom to calm Tom down and ensure he would stop worrying about Julie. But did she do that of her own accord? Out of concern for Tom? Unlikely. A compelling theory is that Lucy was somehow involved in the disappearance of the kids and that maybe, just maybe, she willingly sold them to Hoyt&#8212;her former employer. Maybe her cousin Dan helped her do it. Maybe she genuinely convinced herself that Will and Julie would have a better life with such a rich family. Certainly she didn’t think Will would die. That never seemed to be part of anyone’s plan.</p>\n<p>Did Lucy sleep with Kindt? Is he the real father? Does that embolden him to act on behalf of the Hoyt family? Oh, maybe. If we’re making real-life comparisons already, then we might as well mention “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/08/01/republicans-differ-on-whether-troopergate-remains-a-scandal-for-clinton/?utm_term=.78ccc8b75d96\">Troopergate</a>” and Bill Clinton’s particular sexual appetites when he held high office in Arkansas. In Episode 4, Amelia overhears Lucy wrapping up a call: “Don’t call,” Lucy says. “Who the fuck do you think you’re talking to, motherfucker? Huh? Hello? Hello?” She then tells Amelia that theirs was “not a happy home” (no duh) and that all she could hope for was that her kids would have a better life than she did. But that she messed that up.</p>\n<p>It’s not concrete proof by any stretch, but here’s one more piece of compelling evidence from a <a href=\"https://megaphone.link/PPY3889133426\"><em>Still Watching: True Detective</em></a> listener. Lucy, Tom, Will, and Julie Purcell all shared an unhappy home on Shoepick Lane. (The camera has lingered on that street sign more than once.) In <strong>Nic Pizzolatto’s</strong> home state of Louisiana, there’s an alternative name for bowfins, which are considered largely flavorless, “trash” fish.

Despite efforts to project a manly ardor, the current leader of the free world spends most of his free time tweeting, calling friends, and watching Fox News. Of his <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/how-much-time-trump-spending-trump-properties-n753366\">745 days in office</a>, Trump has spent 222 days unwinding at Trump-branded properties and 168 days golfing. According to the testimony of numerous West Wing staffers, he struggles to focus in meetings, largely ignores intelligence briefings, and tunes out policy minutiae. Once, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/absolutely-out-of-control-cliff-simss-book-depicts-life-in-trumps-white-house/2019/01/21/883d2412-1d92-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html?utm_term=.ba9c2ccede7a\">according</a> to former White House aide <strong>Cliff Sims,</strong> Trump literally got up and wandered away while <strong>Paul Ryan</strong> was in the Oval Office attempting to explain the Republican health-care bill. While Ryan was still talking, Trump walked down the hall to his private dining room and turned on the TV.</p>\n<p>We’ve known since January 2018 that White House staffers have an official designation for these unstructured periods on Trump’s private schedule: “<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/scoop-trumps-secret-shrinking-schedule-1515364904-ab76374a-6252-4570-a804-942b3f851840.html\">Executive Time</a>.” What we didn’t know is exactly how much of the president’s average day is spent un-presidenting.</p>\n<p>In fact, “Executive Time” is far more than just a respite from the duties of the office. In perhaps the most remarkable White House leak this year, Axios on Sunday published about <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-private-schedules-leak-executive-time-34e67fbb-3af6-48df-aefb-52e02c334255.html\">three months’ worth</a> of Trump’s private daily schedules, dating back to the day after the midterm elections. They reveal that Trump has spent around 297 hours&#8212;or roughly 60 percent of his waking hours since the midterms&#8212;in “Executive Time.” For comparison, he’s only spent about 77 hours in meetings&#8212;less time than his travel (51 hours) and eating lunch (39 hours) combined.</p>\n<p>Leaks are endemic to the Trump administration, but this one has especially rattled an already paranoid White House. “If most [leaks] are involuntary manslaughter,” Sims <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/white-house-reaction-trump-private-schedules-leak-a0c23dc5-ad34-47f5-830f-1bc496398cc2.html\">told</a> Axios, “this was premeditated murder.” Morale inside the West Wing has reportedly taken a substantial hit. “What a disgraceful breach of trust to leak schedules,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/madwest45/status/1092186986486657024\">tweeted</a> <strong>Madeleine Westerhout,</strong> the White House’s director of Oval Office operations. “What these don’t show are the hundreds of calls and meetings @realDonaldTrump takes everyday.”</p>\n<p>If Trump really is taking “hundreds” of undocumented calls and meetings every day, that’s another problem entirely, at least for those who care about transparency. But it’s hard to believe Westerhout’s denial, especially when the evidence of how Trump spends his time is so obvious online. From shortly after he wakes up until mid-morning, the president’s Twitter feed is often just responses to what he is watching on Fox News. Often, there is a consistent delay between what had just aired on <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> and a Trump tweet, suggesting that the president watches his programs on a DVR. In the evening, he returns to live-tweeting his favorite Fox hosts, or raging against an unflattering story on CNN.</p>\n<p>In stark contrast, Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-schedule-obama-bush-clinton-513c73ff-4d15-4e7a-9676-334557a894ee.html\">predecessors’ schedules</a> were fully booked. <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> was known to work <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/21/hillary-clinton-white-house_n_5360575.html\">constantly and at all hours</a>, sometimes calling aides in the middle of the night. <strong>George W. Bush</strong> began his day at 5:15 A.M., and <strong>Barack Obama</strong> would stay up until 2 A.M. reading. Trump seems to believe that nobody has ever worked harder&#8212;“[Obama] just sat in here and watched basketball all day,” Sims recalls Trump saying in the Oval Office&#8212;but his protestations appear to be little more than projection.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear whether Trump’s leaked post-midterm schedules reflect an increase or decrease in “Executive Time” over the past year, but it’s clearly information the White House didn’t want made public. The image of the 72-year-old president doddering around the White House with nothing to do for 60 percent of the time is hardly the image his campaign wants seen by the public before the next election. But this particular leak is unnerving for other reasons, too. It suggests, once again, that Trump’s inner circle is not loyal to him. It also would seem to confirm many of the other unflattering portraits of the president as incurious, disorganized, and distractible. ”Trump does review briefing materials, at least if you make it a point to have him do so,” one former senior White House official <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-white-house-meeting-preparation-eee8f937-a45d-499d-b322-acde6b50268c.html\">told Axios</a>. “But only if you talk and guide him through it as he’s reading.”</p>","rubric":"Executive Time","socialTitle":"A Huge Leak Confirms the Worst-Kept Secret of Trump’s

Giuliani,</strong> the relationship is not without its difficulties. “Rudy hates the job,” a Republican briefed on Giuliani’s thinking <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/rudy-hates-the-job-trumps-multi-front-war-is-taking-its-toll\">told</a> my colleague <strong>Gabriel Sherman</strong> last month. “Trump is very hard to deal with.” Trump, in turn, has occasionally exploded at his personal attorney for his <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/rudy-giuliani-robert-mueller-collusion-russia\">bewildering, confessional television appearances</a>. “Trump is screaming. He’s so mad at Rudy,” a source close to the president <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/giulianis-fate-is-uncertain-after-interviews\">said</a> after Giuliani participated in a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/even-if-he-did-do-it-it-wouldnt-be-a-crime-rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-robert-mueller-moscow-buzzfeed\">rambling Q&amp;A</a> with <em>The New Yorker.</em> Several people close to Trump have suggested that he fire Giuliani before he does any more damage.</p>\n<p>These tensions have largely played out behind the scenes, in the West Wing. But on Thursday, the president addressed the latest controversy surrounding Giuliani directly. “Rudy has been wrong,” Trump claimed in his first sit-down <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/us/politics/trump-interview-transcripts.html\">interview</a> with <em>The New York Times</em> in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/us/politics/trump-interview-excerpts.html\">over a year</a>, contradicting his attorney’s shifting statements regarding efforts by the Trump Organization to build a luxury high-rise in Moscow during the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>While Giuliani has since walked back his comments about the Moscow development, his original conjecture&#8212;that Trump was involved in conversations about the real-estate project up until November 2016&#8212;created a massive political headache for the White House. In late January, Giuliani <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/us/politics/trump-tower-moscow-cohen-giuliani.html\">told the <em>Times</em></a> that the talks were “going on from the day [he] announced to the day [he] won,” then immediately told <em>Meet the Press</em> that it was an <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-january-20-2019-n960731\">“active proposal”</a> through the very end of the election.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Trump attempted to repair the damage by tossing his attorney under the bus. “So let me tell you about about Trump Tower Moscow,” he told <em>Times</em> reporters <strong>Maggie Haberman</strong> and <strong>Peter Baker,</strong> who were accompanied in the Oval Office by the paper’s publisher, <strong>A. G. Sulzberger.</strong> “This was a very unimportant deal. This was a very unimportant deal. No. 1. No. 2, this was a deal, the only thing you heard is through Rudy [Giuliani]. Is that what you heard? Through Rudy?”</p>\n<p>“More recently we heard through Rudy, he quotes you,” said Baker.</p>\n<p>Trump responded by making it exceedingly clear that Giuliani did not know what he was talking about:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rudy was incorrect. No. 1, he was incorrect, and we’ve explained that, he was wrong. Rudy has been wrong. A little bit. But what has happened is this. I didn’t care. That deal was not important. It was essentially a letter of intent or an option. I’m not even sure that they had a site. And if you look at where that was sent to, that was a Michael Cohen thing. If you look, I always say, Why don’t you bring this up, to Jay Sekulow, good guy. I think it was sent to almost like a public address for Moscow. If you take a look at it. Take a good solid look. The original letter or something was sent. They didn’t even have anybody to send it to. But that deal is just like other deals. I was doing other deals. I was running for president, but I was also running a business.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even that admission is problematic, of course. Throughout the 2016 election, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-russia-hillary-clinton-emails-dnc-hack\">claimed</a> that he had “nothing to do with Russia,” despite his senior campaign staff meeting with a Russian lawyer peddling dirt on <strong>Hillary Clinton,</strong> and a longtime adviser making nice with WikiLeaks. As the <em>Times</em> recently reported, there were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/26/us/politics/trump-contacts-russians-wikileaks.html\">more than 100 contacts</a> between Trump, his associates, and Russians before the inauguration. In a string of indictments, special counsel <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> has described a vast web of interactions between people in Trump’s orbit and Russians seeking to influence the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Given all that has come to light, the president’s narrative has shifted. Sure, his real-estate company had business with Russia during the campaign, he has said, but it was only speculative. (BuzzFeed has <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation\">reported</a> that the Trump Tower Moscow project would have netted the Trump Organization some $300 million in profit&#8212;among the most lucrative deals he might ever have made.) Where’s the crime?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TIMES: Clearly there was a hope of having money. That was the reason you were pursuing it, right?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TRUMP: My point is this&#8212;It was a free option to look at a deal, to look at deals. That was not like, “I’m going to buy a property in Moscow. I’m going to do&#8212;or I’m building a building in Moscow.” Now, I would have had every right to do a deal. That’s what I did. That’s what I did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rudy was wrong in that he went&#8212;I think what Rudy was looking at, I think, was that in the statement I made to the Mueller group, we talked about during that period of a year, up until the election, we talked about that. So he may have been referring to that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

Remember July 4th weekend when Crooked went before FBI &amp; wasn’t sworn in, no tape, nothing?” (Never mind that Trump has his own <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/emmet-flood-named-white-house-counsel-on-a-temporary-basis/2018/10/18/79b346aa-d2f2-11e8-83d6-291fcead2ab1_story.html\">Clinton lawyer</a> serving as his acting White House counsel.)</p>\n<p>Ironically, it was Trump’s threats, along with those of his lawyer, <strong>Rudy Giuliani,</strong> that Cohen cited in his decision to back out of testifying in the first place. As my colleague <strong>Emily Jane Fox</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/inside-michael-cohens-decision-to-postpone-his-big-day-on-capitol-hill\">reported</a> on Wednesday, Cohen said he was concerned for his own safety and the well-being of his family after several tweets by the president (last year, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1069613383622803456\">tweeted</a> that Cohen ought to serve a “full and complete sentence” for “all of the TERRIBLE, unrelated to Trump, things” he had done), not to mention Trump’s phone call into Fox News wherein he cast aspersions on Cohen’s father-in-law. Giuliani continued the drum beat over the weekend, <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1901/20/sotu.01.html\">suggesting</a> on CNN’s <em>State of the Union</em> that Cohen was cooperating with law enforcement to protect his father-in-law, who he alleged had ties to organized crime in Ukraine. “He goes and testifies against some people that are possibly in organized crime, they ain’t going to be applauding for him when he goes into a restaurant in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, believe me,” Giuliani said.</p>\n<p>Reps. <strong>Elijah Cummings</strong> and <strong>Adam Schiff,</strong> who chair the House Oversight and Intelligence committees, respectively, released a joint statement saying they “understand” Cohen’s position, and have offered to work with him to ensure security meets his standards, but added that, for Cohen, “not appearing before Congress was never an option.” The Senate Intelligence Committee also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2019/01/24/ex-trump-fixer-michael-cohen-subpoenaed-by-senate-committee-lawyer-says-a-day-after-cohen-sought-to-back-out-of-house-testimony/?utm_term=.fcbe9fbdf501&amp;wpisrc=al_news__alert-politics--alert-national&amp;wpmk=1\">has subpoenaed</a> Cohen, according to his lawyer, <strong>Lanny Davis.</strong> When he does testify, Democrats will have plenty to ask him about. Since he was sentenced to prison in December for tax fraud and lying to investigators, reports have emerged that Cohen not only discussed plans for a Trump Tower Moscow during the height of the presidential campaign in 2016, but paid someone to rig online polls for Trump in 2015, and was reportedly directed to lie to Congress by Trump himself. (The last allegation, reported by BuzzFeed News, was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/buzzfeed-mueller-saga-veteran-journalists-circumspect-confused\">thrown into question</a> after <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> issued a carefully worded denial of some elements of the story.)</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Cohen’s team is keeping pressure on the president. “Let me be very clear: the House of Representatives now has an obligation&#8212;a resolution of censure, when the president of the United States indisputably intimidates and obstructs justice to prevent a witness from testifying, is in order,” Davis <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/24/trump-michael-cohen-testimony-1121852\">argued</a> on <em>Good Morning America</em> on Thursday. “So is a federal criminal investigation of Rudy Giuliani for witness tampering. Calling out a man’s father-in-law and wife in order to intimidate the witness is not fair game.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The family drama surrounding <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/biden-2020-front-runner-family-divorce-drama?inline\">Joe Biden’s presidential bid</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; What to make of the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/buzzfeed-mueller-saga-veteran-journalists-circumspect-confused?inline\">BuzzFeed-Mueller mystery</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; A happy ending for one <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/fyre-festival-caterer-gofundme-maryann-rolle?inline\">Fyre Festival contractor</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Intrigue in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jesse-angelo-abruptly-exits-the-new-york-post-murdoch?inline\">Murdoch-land</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Yes, <em>Schitt’s Creek</em> really is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/yes-schitts-creek-really-is-that-good?inline\">that good</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Mueller Investigation","socialTitle":"Trump Mocks Cohen After He Says He Fears for His Safety","socialDescription":"The president’s former lawyer postponed a congressional appearance after the president threatened his father-in-law.

At the time, just a year before 9/11, pop music might have been at its creative nadir, the Billboard charts painted with a tableau of barely-remembered artists who couldn’t be bothered by political commentary: <strong>Sisqó,</strong> Creed, <strong>Rob Thomas</strong> and <strong>Santana,</strong> Savage Garden, and various musicians who wore carpenter jeans and frosted tips. Rage wasn’t playing that game. The nation was slouching toward a showdown between <strong>George W. Bush</strong> and <strong>Al Gore,</strong> two white men in suits racing to the mushy middle.</p>\n<p>With <strong>Michael Moore</strong> directing, Rage used their video to hammer Bush and Gore as two sides of the same centrist coin, a pair of incrementalist politicians beholden to a corrupt system that favored Wall Street billionaires and entrenched-power elites. Given the history that would unfold in the coming years across the Levant, it was a facile argument in hindsight. But politics at that time, before the World Trade Center fell, was defined by complacency and disinterest. Rage declared their answer to this broken system at the conclusion of their music video for “Testify”: an endorsement of <strong>Ralph Nader,</strong> the consumer-rights advocate and Green Party nominee who proclaimed that, “If you’re not turned onto politics, politics will turn on you.” Other celebrities at the time, like <strong>Susan Sarandon, Eddie Vedder,</strong> and <strong>Ben Harper,</strong> lined up behind Nader. He would go on to win 2.8 million votes, only a slice of the national count. But Nader had enough cultural buzz and disaffected supporters on the left to capture almost 100,000 votes in Florida, tipping the presidency in Bush’s direction with an assist from <strong>Pat Buchanan.</strong></p>\n<p>Almost 20 years later, another third-party spoiler has entered the presidential fray. His name is <strong>Howard Schultz,</strong> the self-made billionaire founder of Starbucks. No one, however, will be making a music video about Howard Schultz. Politicians only seep into pop culture when they inspire people, and Schultz, with his hand-gesturing boardroom speak and glaring lack of agenda, is so far only inspiring rage tweets from Democrats who don’t want him to help <strong>Donald Trump</strong> get re-elected. That isn’t stopping Schultz from moving forward. In a Medium <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Howardschultz/ourpath-9164e18bdb98\">post</a> published Tuesday, Schultz wrote that he feels “a deep responsibility and moral obligation to address Americans’ frustrations with our broken two-party system.” Despite the criticisms, he wrote, “I’m excited to keep the conversation going,” the ultimate piece of charmless corporate jargon.</p>\n<p>But Tuesday brought another piece of news that reminds us why Schultz faces such long odds if he chooses to run: the entrance of <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> into the Democratic presidential race. As Sanders and Trump demonstrated in 2016, insurgent politics today is practiced inside the contours of the two-party system, not outside of it. In an era of extreme partisanship, all of the action in American politics, the darkness and the fun alike, is taking place inside the tents of the two major parties. Whether Sanders can fully realize his presidential ambitions the second time around is an open question. But Sanders knows that as much as people loathe the two political parties, those parties also remain the two most important vehicles in the war for power and ideas in 2020. It’s an essential truth about our moment that could leave Schultz out in the cold, hoping to pay off the bouncer to get in to the party.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Given their behavior and tactics to date, Sanders and Schultz, two boys from Brooklyn, are gambling with two very different theories about politics. Both theories have their limits, but Sanders seems to have a better understanding of the state of play as the curtain rises on the 2020 presidential race. Schultz, if he runs, appears to be campaigning from the inside out, a fully-realized American power elite portraying himself as a truth-telling outsider. His media strategy from the get-go seemed the very definition of Amtrak-corridor conventional: a book tour, a <em>60 Minutes</em> interview, sit-downs with <em>Morning Joe</em> and the <em>Goop</em> podcast. None of it screamed populist. As he stepped out into the public crossfire, Schultz wasn’t talking about his rags-to-riches story or his admirable efforts to bring health care to thousands of low-wage earners. Instead, he was lashing both parties for abandoning the centrist impulses of the “silent majority”&#8212;a plurality, if anything&#8212;that was predictably silent when the Twitter mobs immediately came for his head.</p>\n<p>Schultz has a right to tell his story and deserves not to be dismissed out of hand simply because he is a billionaire. The angry question of “What have you ever done?” thrown at Schultz by the online hordes can be equally applied to any number of backbencher politicians and professional activists who are here for the re-tweets. But Schultz misfired by broaching the idea of a third-party candidacy at a time when the public is questioning the very idea of whether billionaires should exist. Those criticisms might have been blunted had he brought a big idea or two to the table. <strong>Ross Perot</strong> and Nader both had proactive agendas and passionate pet issues that defined their candidacies, which didn’t rest solely on trashing their opponents. As a consequence, both Perot and Nader managed to have an outsized impact with voters despite the electoral futility of their campaigns. Schultz, instead, has been little more than a scold, chiding the very politicians who are bringing actual ideas to the table.</p>\n<p>Schultz’s other big mistake was suggesting a third-party bid, claiming a hunger in the country for something other than the menu offerings from Democrats and Republicans. It is true that roughly a third of the country identifies as moderate, according to a recent Pew survey, suggesting a lane for Schultz (or his political consultants). But what Schultz seems not to understand is that in an era of partisan sorting, moderates, too, are choosing sides. For the most part, they are drifting into the Democratic Party, which recaptured the House of Representatives last November not because of firebrand liberals like <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,</strong> but on the backs of suburban moderates hailing from places like Orange County and central Virginia. Moderates do have power. At the moment, they’re just choosing to vote Democrat in opposition to President Trump. What’s more, the idea that registered partisans might abandon their party in the ballot box in favorite of a sensible moderate is increasingly quaint. As the political scientist <strong>Lee Drutman</strong> has written, partisan identity in the age of Trump is much more closely aligned with social and cultural identity. That lends a more intense meaning to your partisan jersey, red team or blue. Common ground is much more difficult to locate outside of the two parties. If Schultz wanted an honest hearing at a time of deep partisan divide, the Democratic primary would have been the most logical place for it. Followed, of course, by a CNN town hall.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>While Schultz runs from the inside out, Sanders seems to be reprising the strategy that almost got him to the pinnacle in 2016, running from the outside in, a people-powered ideologue gunning to take over a Democratic Party that still regards him with suspicion. The very fact that Sanders was not fully accepted into the ranks of the Democratic establishment is one source of his appeal.</p>\n<p>Sanders might be 77 years old and “salty as ever,” as CNN’s <strong>Kate Bolduan</strong> said on-air Tuesday after his announcement, but he’s still a central figure in the dialectic of the Democratic Party, its most uncompromising ideological figure, and best fund-raiser. Like Trump, Sanders didn’t get there by climbing the ladder in Washington like his fellow senators now in the presidential race; he did it by tapping into common-sense ideas about economic fairness and raising oceans of small-donor cash online in the process. He delivered his message using non-traditional media and waited for the green-room journalism crowd to catch up. A democratic socialist, Sanders might have chosen to run in 2016 as a third-party liberal in the mold of Nader. But instead, he smartly decided to disrupt the Democratic Party from the inside by seeking its presidential nomination, all while never calling himself a Democrat. Sanders became the liberal folk hero of the last campaign, the subject of graffiti murals, hipster endorsements, and D.I.Y. merch, the cool grassroots signifiers that swirled around Nader a decade and a half earlier.</p>\n<p>While Sanders lost to <strong>Hillary Clinton,</strong> his failed campaign nevertheless established his place in the political firmament. Today, as he embarks on a new race, his signature issues are now key touchstones in the Democratic primary. When his rivals tip-toe around their commitment to Medicare for all, a new minimum wage, and free college education, Sanders will be right there holding their feet to the fire. And as curmudgeonly as Sanders seems, he also likes the attention from a mainstream press that ignored him for so many decades, which is why he could barely conceal his smiles during his announcement interview with <strong>John Dickerson</strong> on <em>CBS This Morning.</em> Sanders can’t wait to go back on <em>Ellen</em> and hang out with <strong>Killer Mike.</strong> He is able to do all of these things precisely because he isn’t a creature of the Democratic establishment&#8212;because he is disruptive and refuses to play by the rules. So why not run it back in 2020?</p>\n<p>Sanders’s biggest failure in 2016 was not building coalitions. He found it difficult to expand his reach beyond liberals, white workers, and young people, to win over the older women and African-Americans who eventually gave their votes to Clinton. But on CBS, Sanders told Dickerson that unlike in 2016, he can plausibly win the nomination without cobbling together a majority of Democrats. “In some ways it makes it easier,” Sanders said. “When you’re running against one person you know you gotta have 51 percent of the votes. Now who knows what you need? Thirty, thirty-five percent?”</p>\n<p>That may come to pass: Trump slowly grew his campaign throughout the Republican primaries when many pundits expected him to top out around 25 percent. But just as Republicans don’t behave as Democrats, Democrats don’t behave as Republicans. The impulses and issue sets are different, and Sanders has yet to convince Democrats beyond his base of economic progressives that he cares deeply about the plight of immigrants, criminal-justice reform, and the white-hot cultural issues that are roiling our politics under Trump. It would be glib, though, to suggest Sanders hasn’t learned from his mistakes. He has a chance to convince Democrats he’s evolved, even if Democrats now have many more choices than they did when it was just Bernie versus Hillary all day every day.</p>\n<p>Sanders’s outsider patina gave him power in 2016 and it will again in this campaign. But he can no longer wield the element of surprise. Sanders made plenty of enemies in the Democratic Party, in and around Clinton’s campaign specifically. There are legions of well-connected Democrats who do not like Sanders and would rather he spend the rest of his days slurping down Ben &amp; Jerry’s in Burlington. They will plant negative stories about him, steer money to other candidates, puff up his rivals, and happily let him twist in the wind when he stumbles. Those things might not matter to his die-hard supporters, but every successful Democratic nominee after <strong>Jimmy Carter</strong> played nice with party insiders in pursuit of the ring. Even <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> has met with <strong>Jamie Dimon.</strong></p>\n<p>Sanders seems like he’d rather watch a 10-hour <em>Bachelor</em> marathon, <em>Clockwork Orange</em>&#8211;style, than do the same. He is permanently averse to playing the inside political game, gabbing with power brokers on the phone, or charming the media off-the-record. His sequel campaign will test whether those choices matter anymore, whether big speeches, lofty policy ideas, and social media alone can carry the day. This might be a Very <strong>Bill Simmons</strong> Hot Take, but Sanders is the <strong>James Harden</strong> of politics. He’ll get you 30 points a night, but it’s hard to see how he wins a championship without getting his teammates involved. Either way, he’ll still be in the conversation.</p>\n<p><em>Peter Hamby is the host of Snapchat’s</em> Good Luck America.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"2020","socialTitle":"The Bernie Conundrum: Can “Salty as Ever” Sanders Be a Real 2020 Player?","socialDescription":"Whether Sanders can fully realize his presidential ambitions the second time around is an open question.

but one of <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> most shocking claims about a southern border wall has proven a bit exaggerated. The president claimed in Friday’s bizarre Rose Garden presser that several of his predecessors “have told me that we should have” built a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, though he declined to name which former presidents supported it. Perhaps unsurprisingly, representatives for the Bush family and <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> have denied the allegation.</p>\n<p>“This should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me, and they all know it,” Trump said. “Some of them have told me that we should have done it.”</p>\n<p>Clinton spokesperson <strong>Angel Ureña</strong> explicitly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/04/trump-former-presidents-border-wall-1082562\">refuted</a> the president’s assertion, adding that the two men have “not talked since the inauguration.” Bush representative <strong>Freddy Ford</strong> said the wall has never been discussed between the two. Former president George H.W. Bush <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/george-hw-bush-dead-at-94\">died in November</a>, though it is seen as unlikely that he and Trump had any significant discussion of a wall. Trump has famously kept his distance from the Bush family in the wake of past comments and a 2016 presidential campaign rivalry with <strong>Jeb Bush.</strong> Trump did not attend the funeral of former First Lady Barbara Bush in April.</p>\n<p>That just leaves former presidents <strong>Barack Obama</strong> and <strong>Jimmy Carter,</strong> both of whom have criticized Trump’s positions on immigration. An Obama spokesperson reportedly declined comment, though Obama himself has come out against the wall on numerous occasions. Carter, like Obama, has pushed for technological advancements to strengthen U.S. border security, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/trump-wall-shutdown.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, but not the kind of wall that Trump is seeking $5 billion to build. A senior administration official reportedly suggested that Trump was “referring to public comments his predecessors have made about the need for border security, not necessarily for a wall
