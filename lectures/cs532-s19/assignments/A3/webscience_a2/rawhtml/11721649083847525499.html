Police, sent in to break up the symposium, shot Ahmad al-Qurashi, another student activist, in the head. The next day, tens of thousands of people turned out for Qurashi’s funeral procession, fuelling an uprising that coalesced around students and the professional unions. A general strike paralyzed the country a few days later. In what is popularly known as Sudan’s October Revolution, the government was toppled within a month.</p><p>Two months ago, the Sudanese parliament supported a constitutional amendment that would extend the term limits of the current President, Omar al-Bashir, who had been required under the law to step down next year. Two weeks later, student protests erupted in Atbara, Ibrahim’s home town, after bread prices tripled overnight. They have since spread to the capital, where thousands of protesters have faced police violence, tear gas, and mass arrests. Ibrahim, an emeritus professor at the University of Missouri, has cheered the demonstrations from afar. “These guys have been in government for thirty years and never faced a threat like this,” he told me. “Not even from the rebels in the mountains of Darfur.”</p><p>The protests have been downplayed in the media as a “bread riot” or an aftershock of the Arab Spring. But both descriptions misread the situation in Khartoum. Sudan has a long history of peaceful civil disobedience, which successfully brought down military regimes in October, 1964, and April, 1985. For many in Sudan, the current government, which came to power in a coup that negated the gains of the 1985 civil protests, has always been seen as an error to be corrected. In the past, the governments fell in less than two weeks. But, with the current protests now in their eighth week, the regime appears prepared to ride out the people’s revolutionary urge. It has taken measures to “coup-proof” itself by, among other things, keeping common soldiers—who might sympathize with the people—spread out in the rural areas, and reserving mostly special security forces to suppress political opposition in the capital.</p><p>Officially, a thousand people have been detained in connection with the protests, though the actual number is likely much larger. Muzan al-Neel, an engineer based in Khartoum who has participated in the protests, was recently released from six days in detention, where she suffered beatings at the hands of plainclothes National Intelligence and Security Service personnel. “What you think you will do in such a situation is totally different from the way your brain works once you are in that situation,” Neel said, of her time under arrest. “It is not a choice to give them control or not. They already have it.” She now stays up late every Thursday, waiting for the announcement of the next week’s scheduled protests.</p><p>After Sudan declared independence from Anglo-Egyptian rule, in 1956, the British policy of indirect control through a select group of religious and tribal leaders left much of the land and wealth in the hands of a few families. The main political parties were built around these families, but the inability to settle on a single candidate among them led to the formation of a five-member Sovereignty Council. This council was overthrown after two years in power by the military government, which, in turn, was deposed by the general uprising in 1964. The transitional government, free of the old political élite and populated with enterprising professionals, marked an opportunity for the young nation to create a representational system of government. “This is the first and last government in Sudan in which engineers, doctors, veterinarians were represented,” Ibrahim says. “A regular farmer could be the minister of health.” But the new civilian government, troubled by economic unrest, infighting, and the military, eventually fell in the coup of 1969. In 1985, a popular uprising backed by the military would once again raise the glimmer of democracy, only to be usurped by the coup that brought Omar al-Bashir to power.</p><p>Bashir’s government replaced members of the professional class and civil society with party loyalists, and his security forces began torturing activists in secret locations known as ghost houses. It also created a new federalist system, embedding supporters in the local levels of government throughout the country. Unions, professional associations, and political parties were banned, which led to an era of growing inequality. “Big parties lost power slowly, and a political vacuum emerged,” Magdi el-Gizouli, a fellow at the Rift Valley Institute, told me. “Corruption”—funded by oil wealth—“wasn’t just intrinsic. It was a way of doing this kind of politics.”</p><p>It has also been a government of war, one that fixated on the long conflict with rebels in the south and in Darfur, along with the general instability in the region, to justify its leadership. “The government has essentially been saying to its constituency, ‘There are a lot of dangerous people out there and I am your only protector,’ ” Gizouli said. Even with stability largely established in the west, and integration of refugees from war-torn regions throughout the country, the regime continues to exploit old tensions. Neel told me that the government’s current argument is “ ‘Yes, this might be a bad regime, but if it goes, the Darfuris are going to<span data-page="page_final"></span> come and kill you.’ ”</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>In the years of the oil boom, between the late nineties and the two-thousands, Gizouli says, there was an unspoken contract between the government and the upper classes: the government would be left alone in exchange for maintaining high subsidies for oil and bread and protection from violence. A faltering economy has meant that more and more Sudanese, not just the lower classes, have become victims of the military state’s economics. Almost half of the population lives below the poverty line, according to the most recent estimates, and inflation is up thirty per cent from last year. And, with the government’s heavy-handed response to protests, more people have fallen victim to the state’s capacity for violence. “This is not a livable situation anymore,” Neel said. ”We are more scared of law-enforcement bodies than criminals.”</p><p>The rejection of the government has been a long time coming. Today, with the departure of South Sudan, the site of much of the region’s oil wealth, the military regime finds itself lacking both a plausible enemy and a source of funding. The large military apparatus, whose justification was the suppression of domestic insurgencies, is a significant drain on the economy; one Sudanese economist told Radio Dabanga that Sudan’s proposed 2018 budget devoted fourteen per cent of the federal budget to security services, compared to three per cent for education. Zachariah Mampilly, a co-author of “<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1780329970/?tag=thneyo0f-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Africa Uprising</a>,” a book on popular protest in Africa, told me, “When there is no more enemy or fighting, there isn’t a way to justify why you should be there.”</p><p>A younger, increasingly multicultural population, including people displaced internally because of the wars, has fractured the regime’s project of imposing an Islamist identity on the country. At the same time, the involvement of Darfuri students in the current protests has challenged the regime’s propaganda, and established a sense of unity in the capital. Unlike in past demonstrations, the protesters are also not waiting for the military to join the rebellion. “History can sometimes be a crippling fact, when you try to replay it,” Muntasir el-Tayeb Ibrahim, a professor of genetics at the University of Khartoum, told me. Professors at the University of Khartoum, including Tayeb, are helping to draft a Charter of Freedom and Change—similar to the Charter 77 of Czechoslovakia’s Velvet Revolution, in 1989—which will include proposals for creating an interim government, the guarantee of rights and freedoms, and a new inclusive economic program that any new government would have to guarantee. “Even with fear,” Tayeb said, “the people have decided that the government has to go.”</p><p>A number of concerns remain: a counter-revolution, like the one that brought the current government to power, could stifle progress; the ruling élites could hijack the protests to change the figurehead but keep the system intact; and Bashir’s allies in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates, which have a vested interest in his government, might intervene to create a Syria-like situation. The general sense, though, is that the government is only capable of countering violent threats. “The only time governments have been overthrown in the Sudanese context is not with violent struggles but popular movement,” Ibrahim says. “I feel that the things that we did in 1964 is being well taken care of by the youth.” Everyone is waiting to see how the government and ruling class will respond. How do you wage a war on peace?</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="ArticleFooter__footer___3-wlJ"><div class="ArticleContributors__bio___3XQjk"><div

1964, Abdullahi Ibrahim, a member of the University of Khartoum’s student union, was taking notes for a symposium held in protest of the military dictatorship when he became an inadvertent chronicler of a defining moment in Sudan’s post-independence history. Police, sent in to break up the symposium, shot Ahmad al-Qurashi, another student activist, in the head. The next day, tens of thousands of people turned out for Qurashi’s funeral procession, fuelling an uprising that coalesced around students and the professional unions. A general strike paralyzed the country a few days later. In what is popularly known as Sudan’s October Revolution, the government was toppled within a month."],["p","Two months ago, the Sudanese parliament supported a constitutional amendment that would extend the term limits of the current President, Omar al-Bashir, who had been required under the law to step down next year. Two weeks later, student protests erupted in Atbara, Ibrahim’s home town, after bread prices tripled overnight. They have since spread to the capital, where thousands of protesters have faced police violence, tear gas, and mass arrests. Ibrahim, an emeritus professor at the University of Missouri, has cheered the demonstrations from afar. “These guys have been in government for thirty years and never faced a threat like this,” he told me. “Not even from the rebels in the mountains of Darfur.”"],["p","The protests have been downplayed in the media as a “bread riot” or an aftershock of the Arab Spring. But both descriptions misread the situation in Khartoum. Sudan has a long history of peaceful civil disobedience, which successfully brought down military regimes in October, 1964, and April, 1985. For many in Sudan, the current government, which came to power in a coup that negated the gains of the 1985 civil protests, has always been seen as an error to be corrected. In the past, the governments fell in less than two weeks. But, with the current protests now in their eighth week, the regime appears prepared to ride out the people’s revolutionary urge. It has taken measures to “coup-proof” itself by, among other things, keeping common soldiers—who might sympathize with the people—spread out in the rural areas, and reserving mostly special security forces to suppress political opposition in the capital."],["p","Officially, a thousand people have been detained in connection with the protests, though the actual number is likely much larger. Muzan al-Neel, an engineer based in Khartoum who has participated in the protests, was recently released from six days in detention, where she suffered beatings at the hands of plainclothes National Intelligence and Security Service personnel. “What you think you will do in such a situation is totally different from the way your brain works once you are in that situation,” Neel said, of her time under arrest. “It is not a choice to give them control or not. They already have it.” She now stays up late every Thursday, waiting for the announcement of the next week’s scheduled protests."],["p","After Sudan declared independence from Anglo-Egyptian rule, in 1956, the British policy of indirect control through a select group of religious and tribal leaders left much of the land and wealth in the hands of a few families. The main political parties were built around these families, but the inability to settle on a single candidate among them led to the formation of a five-member Sovereignty Council. This council was overthrown after two years in power by the military government, which, in turn, was deposed by the general uprising in 1964. The transitional government, free of the old political élite and populated with enterprising professionals, marked an opportunity for the young nation to create a representational system of government. “This is the first and last government in Sudan in which engineers, doctors, veterinarians were represented,” Ibrahim says. “A regular farmer could be the minister of health.” But the new civilian government, troubled by economic unrest, infighting, and the military, eventually fell in the coup of 1969. In 1985, a popular uprising backed by the military would once again raise the glimmer of democracy, only to be usurped by the coup that brought Omar al-Bashir to power."],["p","Bashir’s government replaced members of the professional class and civil society with party loyalists, and his security forces began torturing activists in secret locations known as ghost houses. It also created a new federalist system, embedding supporters in the local levels of government throughout the country. Unions, professional associations, and political parties were banned, which led to an era of growing inequality. “Big parties lost power slowly, and a political vacuum emerged,” Magdi el-Gizouli, a fellow at the Rift Valley Institute, told me. “Corruption”—funded by oil wealth—“wasn’t just intrinsic. It was a way of doing this kind of politics.”"],["p","It has also been a government of war, one that fixated on the long conflict with rebels in the south and in Darfur, along with the general instability in the region, to justify its leadership. “The government has essentially been saying to its constituency, ‘There are a lot of dangerous people out there and I am your only protector,’ ” Gizouli said. Even with stability largely established in the west, and integration of refugees from war-torn regions throughout the country, the regime continues to exploit old tensions. Neel told me that the government’s current argument is “ ‘Yes, this might be a bad regime, but if it goes, the Darfuris are going

the years of the oil boom, between the late nineties and the two-thousands, Gizouli says, there was an unspoken contract between the government and the upper classes: the government would be left alone in exchange for maintaining high subsidies for oil and bread and protection from violence. A faltering economy has meant that more and more Sudanese, not just the lower classes, have become victims of the military state’s economics. Almost half of the population lives below the poverty line, according to the most recent estimates, and inflation is up thirty per cent from last year. And, with the government’s heavy-handed response to protests, more people have fallen victim to the state’s capacity for violence. “This is not a livable situation anymore,” Neel said. ”We are more scared of law-enforcement bodies than criminals.”"],["p","The rejection of the government has been a long time coming. Today, with the departure of South Sudan, the site of much of the region’s oil wealth, the military regime finds itself lacking both a plausible enemy and a source of funding. The large military apparatus, whose justification was the suppression of domestic insurgencies, is a significant drain on the economy; one Sudanese economist told Radio Dabanga that Sudan’s proposed 2018 budget devoted fourteen per cent of the federal budget to security services, compared to three per cent for education. Zachariah Mampilly, a co-author of “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Africa-Uprising-Popular-Political-Arguments/dp/1780329970"},"Africa Uprising"],",” a book on popular protest in Africa, told me, “When there is no more enemy or fighting, there isn’t a way to justify why you should be there.”"],["p","A younger, increasingly multicultural population, including people displaced internally because of the wars, has fractured the regime’s project of imposing an Islamist identity on the country. At the same time, the involvement of Darfuri students in the current protests has challenged the regime’s propaganda, and established a sense of unity in the capital. Unlike in past demonstrations, the protesters are also not waiting for the military to join the rebellion. “History can sometimes be a crippling fact, when you try to replay it,” Muntasir el-Tayeb Ibrahim, a professor of genetics at the University of Khartoum, told me. Professors at the University of Khartoum, including Tayeb, are helping to draft a Charter of Freedom and Change—similar to the Charter 77 of Czechoslovakia’s Velvet Revolution, in 1989—which will include proposals for creating an interim government, the guarantee of rights and freedoms, and a new inclusive economic program that any new government would have to guarantee. “Even with fear,” Tayeb said, “the people have decided that the government has to go.”"],["p","A number of concerns remain: a counter-revolution, like the one that brought the current government to power, could stifle progress; the ruling élites could hijack the protests to change the figurehead but keep the system intact; and Bashir’s allies in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates, which have a vested interest in his government, might intervene to create a Syria-like situation. The general sense, though, is that the government is only capable of countering violent threats. “The only time governments have been overthrown in the Sudanese context is not with violent struggles but popular movement,” Ibrahim says. “I feel that the things that we did in 1964 is being well taken care of by the youth.” Everyone is waiting to see how the government and ruling class will respond. How do you wage a war on peace?"]]],"canonicalUrl":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-historical-precedents-of-the-current-uprising-in-sudan","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1f7cee7fe02cbd1635ce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1f7cee7fe02cbd1635ce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sudan","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sudan"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Sudan","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"sudan"},{"id":"5c2e1e3ae56e652c9027486e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1e3ae56e652c9027486e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Revolution","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"revolution"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Revolution","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"revolution"},{"id":"5c2e1c777e716b454591ada2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c777e716b454591ada2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Protests","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"protests"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Protests","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"protests"}],"sections":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"News","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":

Awards in Journalism were announced on Tuesday, honoring reporters from more than a dozen news organizations, including the *New Yorker* staff writer [Ben Taub](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/ben-taub). \n\nTaub won the Magazine Reporting Award for his story, from 2018, about how the effort to eliminate *ISIS*{:.small} in Iraq has led to mass executions, detainment camps, and a culture of revenge that is corroding the country from within. “Repeatedly threatened and detained by militias during his three weeks in Iraq, Taub pressed on to document an important story largely ignored in the West,” Long Island University, which presents the awards, said in its announcement of the winners.\n\nTaub also won a Polk Award last year, for his account of a many-faceted humanitarian disaster unfolding in the region surrounding [Lake Chad](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/04/lake-chad-the-worlds-most-complex-humanitarian-disaster), in Central Africa, where people are being devastated by Boko Haram, climate change, poverty, and predatory armies. According to Long Island University, this makes Taub the eighth person to win back-to-back Polk Awards since the prize was founded and the first in twenty years to do so. \n\nTaub joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2017.

Traffic halted at checkpoints and roadblocks as bureaucrats filed behind blast walls and the temperature climbed to a hundred and fifteen degrees. At the Central Criminal Court, a guard ran his baton along the bars of a small cell holding dozens of terrorism suspects awaiting trial. They were crammed on a wooden bench and on the floor, a sweaty tangle of limbs and dejected expressions. Many were sick or injured—covered in scabies, their joints twisted and their bones cracked. Iraqi prisons have a uniform code—different colors for pretrial suspects, convicts, and those on death row—but several who had not yet seen a judge or a lawyer were already dressed as if they had been sentenced to death.\n\n+++inset-right\n----------\n\n_This piece was supported by the Pulitzer Center._\n\n----------\n+++\n\n\nDown the hall, the aroma of Nescafé and cigarettes filled a windowless room, where defense lawyers sat on couches, balancing stacks of paper on their laps. Most were staring at their phones; others sat in silence, arms crossed, eyes closed. In terrorism cases, lawyers are usually denied access to their clients until the hearing begins.\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\n\nShortly after ten o’clock, three judges in long black robes shuffled into Courtroom 2 and sat at the bench. Suhail Abdullah Sahar, a bald, middle-aged man with a thin, jowly face, sat in the center. There were twenty-one cases on his docket that day, sixteen related to terrorism. He quietly read out a name; a security officer shouted it down the hall to one of his colleagues, who shouted it to the guard, who shouted it into the cell. Out came a young man named Ahmed. A security officer led him to a wooden cage in the middle of the courtroom. Judge Sahar accused him of having joined *ISIS*{: .small} in Qayyarah, a small town south of Mosul.\n\n“Sir, I swear, I have never been to Qayyarah,” Ahmed said.\n\nSahar was skeptical. “I have a written confession here, with your thumbprint on it,” he said.\n\n“Sir, I swear, I gave my thumbprint on a blank paper,” Ahmed replied. “And I was tortured by the security services.” Sahar listed Ahmed’s supposed jihadi associates; Ahmed denied knowing any of them.\n\n“Enough evidence,” the prosecutor said. “I ask for a guilty verdict.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cneembed: script/video/5c1149cc8c1abc0c48000006.js?autoplay=0]|||\n**Watch “The Backstory”:**\nBen Taub on the future of Iraq, following the Islamic State’s defeat in Mosul.\n|||\n+++\n\nAhmed had no lawyer, and so Sahar called upon an elderly state attorney named Hussein, who was seated in the gallery, to spontaneously craft a defense. Hussein walked over to a lectern, repeated from memory what Ahmed had said, and, without requesting his release, concluded with a plea for “mercy in his sentencing.”\n\nAhmed wept as he was led out of the room. His trial had lasted four and a half minutes.\n\nThe next suspect insisted that he had been arrested by mistake—that his name was similar to that of someone in *ISIS*{: .small}. A private defense lawyer explained that his client had confessed to *ISIS*{: .small} affiliation under torture—he had a medical examination to prove it—but none of the judges appeared to be listening. As the lawyer spoke, they cracked jokes, signed documents, and beckoned their assistants to collect folders from the bench. Sahar yawned. The trial lasted eight minutes.\n\nThe third suspect was a twenty-three-year-old from a village near Mosul, charged with *ISIS*{: .small} affiliation and arrested while in a displaced-persons camp.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5c12cc9b2eb5b760bfa5e878]||||||\n+++\n\n“When did you join *ISIS*{: .small}?” Sahar asked.\n\n“I didn’t join,” the suspect replied.\n\n“Then why did you thumbprint this confession?”\n\n“They blindfolded me and made me do it.”\n\n“Enough evidence—I ask for a guilty verdict,” the prosecutor said.\n\nThe suspect’s defense lawyer carefully explained that regional intelligence reports showed that the suspect had been mistaken for someone with a similar name. In terrorism trials, the mere presence of a private defense lawyer can signal the suspect’s likely innocence; most lawyers refuse to take on ambiguous cases, out of fear that the security services will harass them for perceived links to the Islamic State. (Last year, Iraqi courts issued arrest warrants for at least fifteen defense lawyers and charged them with *ISIS*{: .small} affiliation.) But, as the lawyer spoke, the judges tended to administrative tasks. The trial was over in nine minutes. “I hate *ISIS*{: .small}—they blew up my house!” the suspect shouted, in tears, as he was led out of court.\n\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\nBy noon, Sahar had presided over ten trials, involving twenty suspects. The courtroom lost power twice, but Sahar kept going in the dark, skimming documents by the light of his cell phone. The final case before lunch involved three defendants, all badly injured. As they limped into the courtroom, a security officer put three plastic chairs in the cage. The last suspect to appear was a bald, bespectacled man in his mid-thirties, named Louai; he was hunched over a pair of short wooden crutches, and moved as if one of his legs were paralyzed and his vertebrae were no longer aligned. Courtroom 2 was silent, except for the sounds of him struggling toward the cage.\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: /photos/5c104b521b07900f29567d0a]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nSahar questioned the other suspects first. One, named Haidar, who wore a back brace, said that he had been mistakenly arrested for a car-bomb attack, in 2014, and that in the course of an interrogation, to make the torture stop, he had started naming random people, including Louai. Judge Sahar then called upon Louai, who rose from his chair and gripped the cage to support himself. “I went to sell my car in the market,” he said. “Then Haidar called me, and I was ambushed, arrested.” He spoke in an urgent, high-pitched tone, but he stuttered and slurred his words; during interrogations, he said, officers had beaten him so badly that he suffered a blood clot in his brain. “They also broke my back!” he shouted. “They broke my feet and hands! I can barely walk!”\n\n“Enough evidence—I ask for a guilty verdict,” the prosecutor said. It was the only phrase she uttered in court that morning.\n\nHaidar’s lawyer noted that there was no witness and no material evidence, and that his request for a medical examination, to prove that Haidar had been tortured, had been rejected. Louai’s lawyer explained that Louai’s confession had been coerced and made no sense: he had said that he remotely detonated the car bomb, when, in fact, the police had concluded that it was a suicide attack.\n\nLouai had spent four years in pretrial detention, and, during the two or three minutes allotted to his defense, the judges had been talking among themselves. “I haven’t seen a judge until now!” he shouted.\n\n“Take them out,” Sahar said. A security officer opened the cage. It took Louai nearly two minutes to limp to the door. Sahar took a lunch break, then ordered his execution.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe Islamic State has been mostly destroyed on the battlefield, but the war is far from over. Air strikes cannot kill an idea, and so it has fallen to Iraq’s fractured security, intelligence, and justice systems to try to finish the task. But, insofar as there is a strategy, it seems almost perfectly crafted to bring about the opposite of its intent. American and Iraqi military officials spent years planning the campaign to rid Iraq of *ISIS*{: .small}, as if the absence of the jihadis would automatically lead Iraq toward the bright democratic future that George W. Bush’s Administration had envisaged when U.S. forces invaded the country, in 2003\\. But *ISIS*{: .small} has always derived much of its dangerous appeal from the corruption and cruelty of the Iraqi state.\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\n\nFor three years, the Islamic State controlled half of Syria and a third of Iraq, a swath of territory approximately the size of Great Britain, which included millions of people. Several members of its senior leadership had been high-level military and intelligence officers in Saddam Hussein’s Baathist regime; they combined the structural prowess of a police state with the cosmic certainty of radical jihadism. The group blew up mosques and [ancient archeological sites](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/isis-and-the-destruction-of-history), and pursued a campaign of ethnic cleansing through mass murder and sexual slavery. It conscripted local bureaucrats, doctors, and teachers, often on pain of death, and devoted enormous effort to radicalizing a generation of children and inuring them to violence, suffering, and loss. At the height of its success, in 2014, there was a real possibility that *ISIS*{: .small} would capture Baghdad, and the Iraqi state would collapse. Now, more than a year after [*ISIS*{: .small} lost Mosul](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/06/the-desperate-battle-to-destroy-isis)—its largest source of legitimacy, wealth, and power—hundreds of thousands of civilians are suffering at the hands of their liberators. Anyone with a perceived connection to *ISIS*{: .small}, however tenuous or unclear, is being killed or cast out of society.\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: /photos/5c104b61c5aa777fdb411e61]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nNot long ago, I met with a senior Iraqi intelligence official who is deeply involved in counterterrorism operations. For three hours, over tea and cigarettes, he described systematic criminality within the security forces, detailing patterns of battlefield executions, murders in detention centers, and coverups organized by the state. He spoke as a witness, but also as a participant; although he is in a position to have stopped certain abuses, by intervening he would have risked incurring accusations that he is sympathetic to the group he has sought to destroy.\n\nHe believes that the Iraqi government’s response is as much a tactical blunder as it is a moral one; it plays directly into the jihadis’ narrative—that Sunnis, who make up a minority of the Iraqi population, cannot live safely under a government dominated by Shiites. “The reaction is one of vengeance—it is not well thought out,” he told me. “We rarely abide by the law.”\n\nThousands of men and boys have been convicted of *ISIS*{: .small} affiliation, and hundreds have been hanged. But, according to the senior intelligence official, these cases represent only a small fraction of the total number of detainees. “A few of the suspects are sent to court, but only to maintain the illusion that we have a justice system,” he said.\n\nSuspects are tried under a law that makes no distinction between a person who “assists terrorists” and one who commits violent crimes on behalf of an extremist group. The conviction rate is around ninety-eight per cent. Family members of the accused rarely show up to watch the hearings, out of fear that they will be detained, too. It’s not uncommon for relatives to be rounded up by the security forces and sent to remote desert camps, where they are denied food, medical services, and access to documents. “We’re deleting thousands of families from Iraqi society,” the official told me. “This is not just revenge on *ISIS*{: .small}. This is revenge on Sunnis.”\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\n\nNine years ago, two C.I.A. officers walked into an Iraqi prison and saw a hallway filled with hooded men, about to be executed for supposed affiliation with Al Qaeda in Iraq, the group that gave birth to *ISIS*{: .small}. “We were hammering A.Q.I., but the Iraqi government was just rounding up Sunnis,” one of the C.I.A. officers recalled. “And, for a moment, it worked.” But, instead of releasing the innocents, the Iraqi government sentenced them to death. “So, of course, they came back,” the officer said, of Al Qaeda in Iraq. “What do you expect? You literally killed their dads.”\n\nIraq is now entering one of the most delicate moments in its recent history. To the extent that *ISIS*{: .small} functioned as a state, it was entirely predatory. But, by having lost on the battlefield rather than being toppled by its own depravity, the caliphate lives on as a fantasy of Islamic justice and governance which is measured against the corrupt reality of the Iraqi state. What is at stake, in this post-conflict period, is whether the Iraqi government can win over the segment of the population for whom *ISIS*{: .small} seemed a viable alternative.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOn an August night in 2011, eight jihadi commanders were sent across the border from Iraq into Syria by their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, to infiltrate Syria’s nascent revolution. By late 2012, they had amassed hundreds of followers from dozens of countries, and were running training camps near Aleppo. During the next year, *ISIS*{: .small} helped the rebels in key battles against the Syrian regime, but as the group became stronger its strategic focus shifted to the formation of a caliphate.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5c12cc9aede0f93942f07857]||||||\n+++\n\nIn June, 2014, a few hundred *ISIS*{: .small} fighters stormed back east across the desert, in mud-caked pickup trucks, and captured the Iraqi city of Mosul, essentially by mistake. In the preceding months, *ISIS*{: .small} had taken over Ramadi, Falluja, and Samarra. But Mosul, with almost two million residents, was the economic center of northern Iraq. The group’s plan was to take a few neighborhoods on Mosul’s western banks and break into a prison, to swell its ranks. Within a week, some sixty thousand Iraqi soldiers and federal police officers, many of whom were reluctant to die in defense of a Sunni city, had shed their uniforms and run away.\n\nFor Mosul’s residents, the announcement of a caliphate from within their city meant that the rest of their lives would be defined by their proximity to *ISIS*{: .small}. Some religious minorities, like Christians, could remain in the city, if they paid a religious tax, but Yazidis and Shiites faced enslavement or slaughter. Half a million civilians fled Mosul. The Islamic State found some support, owing to the abuses that Sunnis had suffered at the hands of the Iraqi government. But most citizens were stuck feigning allegiance to survive, despite the certainty that any compromise with the group would eventually taint them if Mosul were freed.\n\nSome residents spent the next three years waiting out the situation—reading, smoking, counting the days until liberation. For others, interaction with the jihadis was not optional. The Islamic State did not dismantle the Iraqi bureaucracy; it appropriated it, and expanded it. There were departments in charge of alms-giving, the distribution of war spoils, hospitals, and the maintenance and health of rivers. Some institutions operated with greater efficiency and less corruption than before. But, for many bureaucrats, continuing in their duties meant participating in a sectarian criminal enterprise. The role of the estate authorities, for example, shifted from settling everyday land disputes to expropriating and redistributing Shiite property and homes.\n\nFor months, the Mosul civil defense—the city’s professional firefighters and rescue workers—continued to respond to gas and electrical fires. But soon Iraqi and U.S. forces began conducting sporadic bombing raids, and *ISIS*{: .small} informed the rescuers that if they didn’t help retrieve wounded jihadis from the rubble they would be killed.\n\nThe Iraqi government stopped paying salaries—“If they paid us, *ISIS*{: .small} might take the money,” a young civil-defense worker whom I’ll call Mohammad told me—and so the rescuers risked their lives to save *ISIS*{: .small} fighters for free. “Fortunately, coalition planes never hit a civil-defense vehicle,” Mohammad said. But, he recalled, “this started to make problems for us, because *ISIS*{: .small} thought we were coöperating with the coalition.” Mohammad fell under particular scrutiny; he speaks near-fluent English, which he learned by watching American films. In 2015, he quit the civil defense and went into hiding. *ISIS*{: .small} fighters set fire to his house and his car.\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe ground campaign to take back Mosul began in earnest in the fall of 2016\\. Until then, Iraq’s factions and militias had little incentive to coöperate. For the Kurds, *ISIS*{: .small}’s invasion of Mosul had created a [power vacuum](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-limits-of-the-kurds-war-on-isis), which they used to seize oil-rich territory and to try to renegotiate the boundaries of Kurdistan within Iraq. Shiite paramilitary groups, some of which had carried out thousands of attacks against American troops in the previous decade, had mobilized to prevent *ISIS*{: .small} from capturing Baghdad, but it was another two years before the Iraqi government integrated them into the armed forces. It was a Faustian bargain; the most powerful militias, which are collectively known as the [Hashd al-Sha’abi](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-dangers-of-the-iraqi-coalition-headed-toward-mosul), are trained, equipped, and funded by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, and have a reputation for carrying out the kinds of sectarian abuses that had led many Sunnis to welcome the jihadis in Mosul. “Without the Hashd al-Sha’abi, there would be no security in this country,” the senior Iraqi intelligence official told me. “And yet, with them, there is no rule of law. They are above the Army, the law, and the sovereignty of Iraq.”\n\nThe Kurds attacked Mosul from the north and the east. Iraqi security forces approached from the south. American special-operations forces went in, too—officially in a supporting role, but they nevertheless frequently ended up in combat. The U.S.-led coalition decided to leave open the west as a kind of escape valve; this would allow *ISIS*{: .small} members to be picked off as they fled into the desert, toward Syria.\n\n+++feature-large\n[#image: /photos/5c104b753f04a501a075d8d4]|||\n|||\n+++\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\n\nWhat followed was the most intense urban combat since the Second World War. Air strikes pummelled villages and towns in Mosul’s periphery, so *ISIS*{: .small} contracted its territory, retreating to the city, along with thousands of civilians. “They told us that the Iraqi security forces would kill the men and rape the women,” a young woman from the village of Shirqat told me. “We trusted *ISIS*{: .small} more than the Iraqi state.” Other villagers, who had spent years awaiting liberation, were loaded onto buses at gunpoint by *ISIS*{: .small} fighters, and packed into Mosul’s front-line neighborhoods, to be used as human shields. In the ensuing months, the jihadis murdered hundreds of people who tried to escape, and hung bodies from electrical pylons.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nBy early 2017, Mosul was half free. The city is bisected by the Tigris River. Its east side has wide avenues and low buildings. Backed by coalition airpower, East Mosul was taken mostly by élite Iraqi counterterrorism forces, fighting house to house. They took care to minimize civilian casualties, and suffered tremendous losses of their own. By the end of the battle for East Mosul, as much as seventy-five per cent of the counterterrorism forces had been injured or killed.\n\nThe combat was much worse in West Mosul—especially in the Old City, a densely populated warren of alleyways, tunnels, and souks nestled against the banks of the Tigris. Its streets were too narrow for armored vehicles to pass through, and jihadis could easily slip between roofs and alleys and basements. To an outside force, it was practically impenetrable. The coalition bombed all five of Mosul’s bridges and sealed off the western escape valve, while thousands of Iraqi soldiers, federal police officers, and Hashd fighters besieged the Old City.\n\nThe Old City was home to Mosul’s richest history and poorest residents. Thenoon Younnes Abdullah, a middle-aged father with a bushy mustache, dyed brown, had spent the past couple of decades working as a day laborer, until his body gave out; to provide for his wife, Alaa, and their four children, he resorted to selling bootleg gasoline. Like most of his neighbors, he resented the *ISIS*{: .small} fighters, who swaggered through the souks, flush with cash, telling him how to live—especially the foreigners, who barely spoke Arabic and had no connection to Mosul. Some of them had converted to Islam only a few months before coming to Iraq for the jihad. Abdullah’s family had lived in the same cluster of houses, on the same block, with the same neighboring families, for as many generations as he could remember.\n\nFor three years, the Iraqi Army had told civilians to stay at home and wait for liberation, and Abdullah and his family had listened. Now, as the Army encircled the Old City, electricity and water supplies were cut off, and life became impossible. People began to starve. The jihadis were breaking into homes, stealing food, and digging tunnels between basements, to pass undetected. They set up firing positions on people’s roofs, and stockpiled explosives in living rooms. Anyone who resisted was killed.\n\nThe coalition concluded that the Old City could not be captured according to the rules of engagement that had governed the battle in East Mosul, so it loosened its requirements for calling in an air strike. In March, the U.S. dropped a five-hundred-pound bomb on a roof in the Old City, in an effort to kill two *ISIS*{: .small} snipers. The explosion killed a hundred and five civilians who had been sheltering inside the building. Survivors reported that there were no *ISIS*{: .small} fighters in the vicinity at the time of the strike.\n\nOne night, when the shelling relented, Abdullah and his family hurried downhill to the banks of the Tigris, carrying inner tubes and two large coolers. None of them knew how to swim. Abdullah helped the kids into the coolers—two in each—and he and Alaa climbed onto the inner tubes, clinging to the children and each other as they floated downstream, to liberated territory.\n\nBy early July, *ISIS*{: .small} fighters had killed thousands of government troops and police officers, and Iraqi commanders were under enormous pressure to finish the battle. The next few weeks were a bloodbath. *ISIS*{: .small} fighters who surrendered were executed on the spot. Iraqi security forces filmed themselves hurling captives off a cliff, then shooting them as they lay dying on the rocks below. Helicopters buzzed the Tigris, bombing people as they tried to swim across. The troops assumed that anyone still living in the Old City sided with the Islamic State. For the rest of the month, corpses bobbed downstream, dressed in civilian clothes. “We killed them all—Daesh, men, women, and children,” an Iraqi Army officer told a Middle Eastern news site, using the Arabic acronym for *ISIS*{: .small}. As he spoke, his colleagues dragged a suspect through the streets by a rope tied around his neck. “We are doing the same thing as *ISIS*{: .small}. People went down to the river to get water, because they were dying of thirst, and we killed them.”\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\n\nWhen the battle was over, soldiers used construction equipment to shovel rubble into the entrances of *ISIS*{: .small} tunnels—ostensibly to suffocate any remaining jihadis, but also to mingle corpses and concrete, thereby obscuring the scale of the atrocities. As late as March of this year, journalists were still finding the bodies of women and children on the riverbanks, blindfolded, with their hands tied behind their backs and bullet holes in their skulls.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nA year and a half after Iraq declared victory, the Old City is in ruins. Sunlight gleams through bullet holes in tin garage doors. Massive blocks of concrete dangle from broken roofs. The floors of apartment buildings remain as they fell, in layers, having crushed whatever was between them. The U.N. estimates that the battle for Mosul has left behind around ten million tons of rubble. Some stone structures have landed at odd angles, to disorienting effect, as if gravity were pulling in every direction. There are burned-out power lines, and staircases to nowhere. It is completely silent. Near the site of an old post office, there is a single intact traffic light. It changes every thirty seconds, for no one. Every few feet you catch the smell of desiccated corpses. Also inescapable is the scale of history, obliterated. Many of the buildings were continuously inhabited from the seventh century until the second week of July, 2017\\. To walk through the Old City is to tread on its final generations’ graves.\n\nShortly after the battle ended, Mohammad returned to his job in the civil defense. Every day, locals lined up outside a temporary fire station in West Mosul and asked for help retrieving the bodies of their relatives. “We recorded their names and gave them a date,” he recalled. “And when their date came they would come with us to the Old City and show us the house that had been hit by an air strike, and we would dig until we could take out the body.”\n\nThe coalition has acknowledged a civilian death toll in the low hundreds. But the West Mosul civil defense has retrieved thousands of corpses from the Old City. Last December, the Associated Press obtained a list of nearly ten thousand civilians whose bodies had been registered at the local morgue. Most had been crushed to death by falling concrete; for others, the cause of death had been entered into the morgue’s database simply as “blown to pieces.” (Thomas Veale, a U.S. Army colonel and a spokesman for the coalition, told the A.P. that it was “irresponsible” to draw attention to civilian casualties in West Mosul. If not for the coalition’s campaign, he said, Iraqis would have suffered years of “needless death and mutilation” at the hands of “terrorists who lack any ethical or moral standards.”)\n\n“All of them are civilians,” Mohammad said. “When we find unknown bodies, we leave them behind,” because there would be no way to apply for a death certificate or to return a corpse to its family for burial. “Sometimes people come here and tell us that they have dead relatives in the Old City, but we know that they are not _from_ the Old City,” Mohammad said. “They are from Qayyarah or Shirqat,” towns where the Islamic State had more support. When that happens, civil-defense workers infer an *ISIS*{: .small} link and refuse to retrieve the corpse.\n\nThe skeletons in the rubble have not been picked clean by animals, or bleached white by the sun. There are fingernails and yellow teeth and dusty clumps of hair. Bone fragments line the roads, amid scraps of fabric and leather and glass. Near the river, I saw a torso dangling loosely from a mess of twisted rebar—swaying hands, fractured skull. Blackened ligaments drooped from the arms. “Daesh,” a stranger said to me, smoking a cigarette, pointing at the corpse. He kept moving.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5c12cc9a9f6c733af90adcb5]||||||\n+++\n\nNearby, I met Thenoon Younnes Abdullah. He waved, and carefully wound his way down a three-story pile of rubble—the site of his former home—with his ten-year-old son. The family had returned to salvage whatever they could. Everything of any value had already been looted, but they rescued a broken generator, and tied it to the back of their car.\n\nAbdullah told me that, after the battle, his cousins were the first in his family to return to the Old City; as soon as they opened their door, they were blown apart by I.E.D.s. Months later, when Abdullah arrived, he found his own house in ruins, and several dead *ISIS*{: .small} fighters inside. He also found Alaa’s mother’s corpse; she had stayed behind, too frail to run away.\n\nAbdullah led me up the hill of tangled metal and concrete, and we entered his house by ducking under a staircase, through a hole in the bathroom wall. On the floor of the dining room were three stains, where fluids had leaked out as the bodies decomposed. Abdullah’s brother died across the street, but his body hasn’t been found.\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\n\nIt was difficult to move. The floor was littered with debris, but I noticed transistors, ball bearings, and other bomb-making materials scattered about. Then, on my way out, my foot knocked over a concrete block and uncovered an I.E.D. I stopped, and noticed two other unexploded bombs a few feet away, as well as four detonators. We climbed back out through the hole in the bathroom wall, and came down the hill, past an *ISIS*{: .small} corpse in rotting leather sandals.\n\nReconstruction in the Old City will cost billions of dollars, according to the U.N., but, aside from the exorbitant cost, I had the impression that the Iraqi government has been content to leave it in ruins, as a kind of punishment. Abdullah told me that he had seen no evidence of institutional cleanup—only posters from N.G.O.s, warning about the perils of walking in areas filled with unexploded ordnance, which still regularly kills people in the Old City.\n\nAbdullah and his family piled into their car and headed to another part of the city, where they were staying in an abandoned, mostly destroyed building. He navigated by peering through a hole in the windshield, caused by shelling more than a year earlier.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe war against the Islamic State displaced a million people in Nineveh Province. Civilians who had fled *ISIS*{: .small} at the outset, in 2014, were asked by Kurdish and Iraqi intelligence officers to inform on neighbors who had assisted the group. The names were then entered into databases of terrorism suspects, available to Iraqi security branches, including the Hashd militias. As the war dragged on, the lists became increasingly unreliable. People reported their enemies, and wielded the threat of denunciation in personal, tribal, and workplace disputes. “We have thousands of suspects in custody whose names were falsely reported, or are based on incorrect information, and they are treated as *ISIS*{: .small} members,” the senior Iraqi intelligence official told me. He said that some Hashd fighters ran an extortion racket, demanding thousands of dollars from civilians and adding their names to the terrorism database if they couldn’t pay.\n\n+++feature-medium\n+++group-2\n[#image: /photos/5c12cc9a180e7352ae16670d]|||\n|||\n[#image: /photos/5c12cc9b9ec14d553b1ae855]|||\n|||\n+++\n+++\n\nTo many members of the Iraqi security forces, all civilians who hadn’t fled *ISIS*{: .small} were suspicious. Some soldiers regarded beards as a marker of affiliation, even though the jihadis had punished men who shaved. Others, by contrast, singled out men who had recently shaved or cut their hair, believing that the men were trying to evade detection. Injuries, too, attracted accusations of complicity; how could anyone know whether people who had barely survived shelling and air strikes were targets or merely collateral?\n\nAs civilians marched out of Mosul, toward camps for the displaced, masked informants stood at checkpoints, pointing out individuals who, they claimed, had worked with the Islamic State. Some of the informants were children, but that didn’t matter in court—a suspect would never find out who had denounced him, or what was said.\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\n\nAll suspects were supposed to be handed over to the counterterrorism services, for an in-depth security screening. In practice, however, many captives faced vigilante justice in the streets. In October, 2016, Iraqi security forces filmed themselves executing a captive in Qayyarah, an hour south of Mosul. They also tied the bodies of several dead *ISIS*{: .small} fighters to the back of a Nissan pickup truck and dragged them through Qayyarah’s main road, while villagers cheered; children kicked the corpses, and a man stood on one of the bodies, surfing. According to Human Rights Watch, which obtained thirteen videos from the scene, a man from a nearby village came to Qayyarah after hearing that the man who had killed his father and three of his uncles was among the dead fighters. He beheaded the man and cut out his heart, then presented it as a gift to his mother.\n\nElsewhere in Iraq, security forces filmed themselves punching, kicking, and whipping men in ad-hoc detention sites, including school classrooms. They dragged suspects by the hair, stepped on their heads, slammed knees into their faces, and threw furniture at them. They beat people unconscious; they beat people to death. They filmed themselves gunning down captives in open fields and stabbing them in the face with knives. A group of Hashd members struggled to interrogate six foreign fighters who couldn’t speak Arabic; in the end, they shot them, doused them in gasoline, and lit them on fire—including two who were still alive. A federal police officer filmed himself beheading captives, including minors, and posted the videos to his Facebook account. He told a Swedish reporter that he had decapitated fifty people so far, all while they were still alive; as he paraded through the streets holding severed heads aloft, other uniformed police officers and soldiers cheered and marched alongside him. All through northern and western Iraq, anti-*ISIS*{: .small} forces kept lists of people they wanted to kill. They hung bodies from telephone poles, and encouraged civilians to desecrate the corpses of their former jihadi oppressors. The irony was not lost on the killers—they knew that they were mirroring the Islamic State’s worst acts.\n\nThe Iraqi government has sought to minimize attention to such atrocities. Haider al-Abadi, who served as Prime Minister between 2014 and October, 2018, dismissed them as “individual acts” for which the perpetrators would be held to account. But there have been no meaningful investigations. According to the senior Iraqi intelligence official, “all Hashd violations are carried out with the knowledge and approval of the national-security apparatus, in all governorates.” He added that the government has provided official cover for numerous civilian massacres, by organizing press conferences and lying about the provenance of mass graves. “The Iraqi government brought in journalists and said, ‘Look, *ISIS*{: .small} killed these civilians,’ when in fact it was the Hashd al-Sha’abi,” he said. “The reality is totally different from what ends up in the media. At least *ISIS*{: .small} had the courage to not hide its crimes.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nSuspects who survived their capture were taken to detention facilities in and around Mosul. Iraqi law stipulates that suspects must be brought before an investigative judge within twenty-four hours of arrest, but many people languished in custody for months. Although there were only around eight thousand *ISIS*{: .small} fighters living in Mosul, and far fewer in the surrounding villages, the lists of wanted people grew to some hundred thousand names. Dank, windowless cells held a hundred or more detainees each. Some facilities had no budget for food. Injuries that had been incurred on the battlefield, or during interrogation sessions, grew infected and gangrenous. Amputations were common, and detainees routinely died of suffocation or disease.\n\n+++feature-xsmall\n[#image: /photos/5c12cc9a2eb5b760bfa5e876]|||\n|||\n+++\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\n\n“Hundreds of innocent people have been detained because their names are similar to those of wanted people, and the state is doing nothing to solve this,” the senior Iraqi intelligence official told me. (Mohammad is thought to be the most common name in the world.) Others are held on the basis of uncontrollable facts of identity: the suspect was a Sunni male of fighting age, from a village where the jihadis enjoyed widespread toleration or support; the suspect was the wife, father, brother, or cousin of a fighter; the suspect was a member of a rural tribe whose leader had pledged fealty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. If someone is found innocent and released, no letter is sent to the entire security establishment to clear his name. “He might be arrested again, and this time not get released,” the official said.\n\nIn late August, I met a seventeen-year-old *ISIS*{: .small} fighter inside a facility in Iraqi Kurdistan that is holding dozens of minors who have been convicted of *ISIS*{: .small}-related crimes. His name was Noor, and, along with another teen-ager, named Ahmad, he volunteered for an interview. In April, 2016, when Noor was fourteen, one of his friends recruited him to attend an *ISIS*{: .small} training camp. He wouldn’t specify what attracted him to the Islamic State, saying only, “If there was something I didn’t like about the group, I would not have joined.” That October, he was captured by Kurdish forces near the town of Bashiqa, dressed like a member of *ISIS*{: .small}, with long sleeves and pants stopping above the ankles, and carrying a Kalashnikov. Noor was the only jihadi in his family—he told me that he had joined *ISIS*{: .small} without his parents’ knowledge or permission—but, last year, members of a Hashd group arrested his relatives, expropriated their home and property, and sent them to detention camps.\n\nAs Noor spoke, Ahmad looked uncomfortable. He said that he wanted to talk, but not with Noor in the room. A prison worker escorted Noor back to his cell.\n\n“I’ve been here for two years and eight months, trapped with all these jihadi kids!” Ahmad said in a rush. “But I’m not *ISIS*{: .small}! They picked me up by mistake!” One of his cousins had been recruited, but no one in his immediate family had joined. Nevertheless, when Kurdish forces liberated his town, intelligence officers detained Ahmad and tortured him until he made a false confession. He lifted his shirt to reveal faint lines all over his back, from whipping and beating, and a twisted knot of a scar on his upper arm. At this point, Kurdish prison workers said that the interview was over. “I showed the judge that I had been tortured,” Ahmad continued. But the judge told him that an unnamed witness had claimed he had carried a gun, and sentenced him to five years.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe pace of arrests has recently slowed. In Mosul, there are now only two or three raids per week. Most of them are carried out by an Iraqi *SWAT*{: .small} team, with assistance from the United States military, which provides intelligence—names, addresses, sometimes a photograph—as well as vehicles, arms, and air support. In return, American soldiers are given access to detention facilities, to collect the fingerprints and eye scans of high-value targets. Sometimes they take suspects away, returning them days or weeks later, when they’ve finished their own interrogations.\n\nThe most powerful Shiite paramilitary units have a similar relationship with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Security and intelligence officers from the Hashd still patrol the ruins of the Old City, occasionally making arrests. On August 30th, a group of them, dressed in plain clothes, detained me in front of the ruins of Thenoon Younnes Abdullah’s home, and questioned me for three hours. They photographed my face, passport, and Iraqi visa, and the commander, a wide-faced man who goes by Abu Ali, warned that I would be arrested if I returned to the Old City. Then two Hashd intelligence officers grabbed their Kalashnikovs, got into my car, and, with a follow vehicle, escorted me across the bridge to East Mosul. During the drive, the two men showed me cell-phone photos and videos of supposed *ISIS*{: .small} fighters they had killed all over Iraq. I asked whether their unit shares intelligence with, or receives it from, any foreign governments. “We refuse to talk about this,” one of them, who was wearing bluejeans and a Gucci baseball cap, said. “Because America is not friendly with Iran.”\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\n\nPretrial detention can last years, and even if detainees don’t die from the conditions they may still never see the inside of a courtroom. Thousands of files have been misplaced within the bureaucracy, as detainees have been transferred among sites run by overlapping security agencies—meaning that, on paper, the suspects are missing. “Hundreds more have been killed during interrogations,” the senior Iraqi intelligence official told me. Ministry of Health officials, he said, usually classify the cause of death as “unknown” or “heart attack,” and then dispose of the corpse.\n\nThe process is so corrupt that, according to the official, “only the poor *ISIS*{: .small} members go to court. The wealthy ones can buy their way out of the system.” Unable to trust their colleagues in other departments not to release *ISIS*{: .small} members, some intelligence officers have resorted to murdering high-value detainees.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5c12cc9aede0f93942f07859]||||||\n+++\n\nNot long ago, the senior intelligence official looked on as a group of his subordinates beat a Saudi fighter with iron bars, inside an ad-hoc detention center near Mosul. The fighter taunted his interrogators, saying that if he recovered he would return to the battlefield and fight them again. They broke his arms and legs, and threw cinder blocks onto his back. “Who knows, exactly, when he died,” the official said. “But he wanted to become a martyr, and so the interrogators obliged.”\n\nI asked him whether the Iraqi government notifies foreign embassies when its intelligence officers kill their citizens. He said that most European fighters are referred to the judiciary unscathed, because their identities are widely known, and their fates are scrutinized by the international press. “But most of the Arab foreign fighters do not make it to court,” he said. “We do not tell their governments what happens to them, and their governments do not ask.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn Baghdad, the relentless pace of trials struck me as so incongruous with the lack of evidence, the certainty of convictions, and the severity of sentences that I began to wonder whether judges had access to secret intelligence reports that they weren’t sharing in court. One evening, I visited the office of Munir Haddad, a magistrate who presided over the trial of Saddam Hussein. It was a troubled proceeding—defense lawyers were assassinated, and the Prime Minister pressured judges into issuing a death sentence—but, compared with the *ISIS*{: .small} trials, Haddad said, “I believe the process was reasonably transparent. Saddam had lawyers. Only six or seven people were executed. These days, in terrorism courts, at least twenty-five people are sentenced to death every single day.”\n\nHaddad lit a cigarette and threw his legs over an elegant wooden chair. Ali Shimari, a handsome young lawyer, sat next to him. Haddad left the bench years ago; he and Shimari now work as a team, defending terrorism suspects whom they believe to be innocent. That morning, Shimari had sat through the same hearings that I had. “Everything that the judge saw, the lawyers saw, too,” he said. “There’s usually no evidence, just the confession.”\n\nI asked Shimari if the arbitrary nature of the trials frustrated him. “What can I do?” he replied, shrugging. “I’m a defense lawyer. I can’t tell the judge to pay attention. You can try once or twice, but it has no effect.”\n\nHaddad laughed. “We are not in America,” he said. “It’s not possible to argue with the judge, because if you do he’ll just take it out on your client. As a lawyer, you just have to accept the humiliation.”\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\n\nI asked Haddad whether, as a former judge in Iraq’s highest-profile tribunal, he believed that judges see their role as meting out a kind of cosmic justice, even if the truth lies beyond the kinds of evidence that can plausibly be collected. “*ISIS*{: .small} has so many victims,” he said. “There have to be convictions.”\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: /photos/5c104b8b34e30108b56d7e6f]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nThaer Abd Ali al-Juboori, the spokesman for the Ministry of Justice, told me much the same thing. “Human-rights groups focus on the rights of suspects, but what about the rights of the victims and their families?” he said. “We have undergone thousands of terrorist attacks. There is immense public pressure on the judicial authorities.” He continued, “9/11 left three thousand people dead. The whole world obsessed over this attack. We cried for your innocent deaths. But, here in Iraq, we have had a terrorist death toll that has exceeded that by a factor of a hundred. Where is the sympathy that we have shown to the victims of 9/11? This is what Iraqis are upset about. We fight terrorists every day, on behalf of the rest of the world. And no one cares about our suffering.”\n\nThe amount of time that convicts spend on the waiting list to be hanged fluctuates between months and years, because each execution order requires a signature from the President of Iraq. Barham Salih, a progressive Kurd, who was imprisoned and tortured by Saddam Hussein’s regime, assumed the Presidency in October.\n\nIn the past, Salih has distinguished himself through his opposition to capital punishment. In 2002, when he was Prime Minister of the eastern part of Kurdistan, he refused to sign the death warrant for an unrepentant Al Qaeda sympathizer who had attempted to kill him. “I think this is a fundamental question of what type of society we want,” Salih said at the time. “I don’t believe that anyone, or the state, should take people’s lives.” Sixteen years later, it’s not clear that any Iraqi Presidency could survive such a stance. Throughout the *ISIS*{: .small} period, in the aftermath of terrorist attacks, the Iraqi government has carried out mass executions in order to mollify an outraged public. I wrote to Salih’s press secretary, Lukman Faily, several times, to ask whether Salih is signing execution orders, but did not hear back.\n\nExecution orders are carried out by the Ministry of Justice. In 2009, Al Qaeda operatives detonated a car bomb outside the ministry’s headquarters, killing thirty-five employees. Four years later, terrorists attacked the replacement headquarters. “Every time we publicized an execution, we would get attacked,” Juboori recalled. Afterward, staffers demanded to be moved to the Green Zone or to have the task of executing convicts referred to a different department. But after a few days they gave up and went back to work. “We have to earn a living,” Juboori said. Today, the ministry occasionally publishes the numbers of people executed, but leaves out the names; by obscuring the identities, Juboori said, the ministry can accede to the public’s demand for results while minimizing the likelihood of retaliatory attacks.\n\nTo human-rights groups and foreign officials, the Ministry of Justice’s opacity is a source of frustration. “Often we would find out about mass executions by reading about them on the justice minister’s Facebook page,” a European diplomat, who spent much of the past three years in Baghdad, told me. “There will be some notification saying that they’ve killed forty-two terrorists. O.K., but who? Of which nationalities?” Juboori denied that this was the case; after a foreign fighter is executed, he said, his colleagues put the body in a refrigerated chamber, and inform the relevant embassy.\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\n\nThe Iraqi judiciary has also exposed the willingness of Western liberal democracies to quietly regard due process as a strategic disadvantage. During the battle for Mosul, France deployed élite soldiers to track and kill its own citizens. Some five thousand Europeans joined *ISIS*{: .small}, and, of the thousand or more who have returned to their home countries, very few have been charged with crimes, owing to the near-impossibility of collecting court-level evidence in a foreign war zone. European intelligence agencies are overwhelmed; to carry out comprehensive surveillance on a single target requires a team of around thirty people. And so countries that have outlawed capital punishment are tacitly encouraging Iraq to eliminate their jihadi citizens. “If the Iraqi government were just rounding up and killing Iraqis in this way, we could be more vocal” in criticizing it, the European diplomat said. “But we don’t have any idea what to do about our own citizens. There is no policy.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nFor many terrorism convicts, a stop before the gallows is a spot on Iraqi state television, as participants in a reality show called “In the Grip of the Law.” Prisoners explain on camera how they supposedly plotted and committed heinous acts, sometimes visiting the scenes of their crimes. They also renounce terrorism, and agree that they deserve to die. One afternoon in September, the host, Ahmad Hassan, welcomed me to the studios of Al Iraqiya, shook my hand, and threatened to sue me if I misquoted him. He recalled an incident in which a foreign journalist had quoted him as saying “jihadis” when he had actually said “*ISIS*{: .small} terrorist gangs”; in the days after publication, Iraqi politicians and security officials asked him why he’d used a word that could be perceived in a neutral light.\n\n+++feature-large\n[#image: /photos/5c12cc9aef12204ae0c06031]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nJust off the set, a director was working on an upcoming episode. A man in an orange jumpsuit was sobbing onscreen. The director spliced in footage from an *ISIS*{: .small} video, featuring a mass execution. “This is Mowafaq Ahmad Shihab—he’s from a first-class *ISIS*{: .small} family,” Hassan told me. “Most of his sons worked for the *ISIS*{: .small} terrorist gangs.” In the *ISIS*{: .small} footage, a masked man lifted a pistol to the head of a kneeling hostage. “His son will now carry out an execution of some prisoners,” Hassan said, as the footage rolled on. “And what Mowafaq confessed in the investigation is that he was helping his son execute innocent citizens.”\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\n\nHe pointed to a figure in the crowd. “Mowafaq is in the background,” he said. To my eye, there was practically no resemblance: the man in the *ISIS*{: .small} video had a full head of white hair, whereas Mowafaq was mostly bald, and what hair he had was black, except for a bit of gray in his beard. When the show aired, two weeks later, the clip was blurred to obscure the differences. But there was still an inconsistency between the episode and its trailer: the arrows for Mowafaq pointed to two different men.\n\nAccording to Hassan, the show, which airs on Friday evenings, has millions of viewers. “In the Grip of the Law” is dependent on the involvement of the legal and security-intelligence establishments, and glorifies their work. “It’s the only program in this country that increases public trust and confidence in the security forces and judicial offices,” Mujahid Aboalhail, the head of Al Iraqiya, told me. “It passes the message to the whole world that the fate of these terrorists is in the grip of the law!”\n\nHassan walked over to the set where he films his opening statements. He took off his jacket and sat behind a large wooden desk—clear, except for a single lamp. Behind him was a map of Baghdad, decorated with images of police reports and mug shots of various suspects. He wore a white shirt with light-blue pinstripes, a deep-red tie, and an oversized watch; his black hair was slicked back, shining under the stage lights. Hassan put his elbows on the table and scowled—the caricature of a TV detective. There was a bookshelf filled with evidence binders, but they were empty.\n\n“Ask me what you would like to know,” Hassan said. I led off with a biographical question. He ignored it, unlocked his phone, and started reading aloud a prepared statement, occasionally stopping in the middle of a phrase in order to catch his breath. “The idea for this program came to me because Iraq suffered many terrorist attacks, lots of vicious acts of bloodshed,” he read. “This program doesn’t just do interviews. It also shows CCTV, weapons, car bombs, explosives—actual evidence. This has helped maintain pressure against terror groups. It also helps spread awareness to security forces about how terrorist groups operate. It also gives awareness to the citizens to beware terrorist tactics, and helps citizens gain confidence in the security-intelligence establishment.” He paused. “Do you want me to talk about how I pick the prisoners?”\n\n“Is that in the statement?” I asked.\n\n“I have written a set of responses to questions I expect you to ask.”\n\nHassan insisted that he merely offers prisoners “a chance to repent,” and that they take him up on it because they “feel regret.” But the substance and tone of their confessions raise questions. In Mowafaq’s episode, he is marched down a sealed-off street in Mosul, handcuffed and blindfolded, and forced to kneel in front of a line of masked members of the security forces. His blindfold is removed; they’re holding automatic weapons. It looks like the lead-up to a street execution—the director used a split screen to mirror the *ISIS*{: .small} tape—and, as Hassan questions him, it’s not at all clear that Mowafaq, who has already been sentenced to death, knows otherwise.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOn July 10, 2017, a twenty-five-year-old woman from Shirqat, who goes by Umm Saleh, arrived at a camp for the internally displaced, just outside Qayyarah. She had spent the previous week running between buildings in Mosul’s Old City, where an air strike on a school had killed her father, her brothers, and one of her sisters. Umm Saleh’s husband survived the explosion, but amid the chaos the couple lost track of each other, and so she left Mosul with their three children, carrying the youngest in her arms. Members of the Iraqi security forces robbed and harassed Umm Saleh at every checkpoint. Many of them obscured their faces with balaclavas and masks, and had patches on their uniforms of the skull worn by the Punisher, a Marvel Comics antihero who kidnaps, extorts, and murders people in the pursuit of his own conception of justice; the skull is the last thing that his victims see before they die. “If the Americans weren’t behind us, we would burn you,” a soldier told Umm Saleh. She had left Mosul with some cash and gold but arrived in Qayyarah penniless.\n\nUmm Saleh expected to reunite there with her husband. He hadn’t joined *ISIS*{: .small}, but his brothers had been conscripted as fighters. Because he hadn’t denounced them or severed ties, on the way to the displaced-persons camp he was picked out of line during a security screening, and taken away.\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\n\nOne day, a member of the Iraqi security forces visited the camp, promising to look into the cases of detainees, for a fee of a thousand dollars. Umm Saleh’s mother and sister sold all their gold to pay the bribe, and Umm Saleh gave him her husband’s name. The soldier took the money and never came back.\n\nAt the camp, Umm Saleh was placed in a sector populated by widows of the Islamic State who had also grown up in Shirqat. Because Umm Saleh’s husband was mistaken for an *ISIS*{: .small} fighter, she is now perceived by camp administrators and guards as the female head of an *ISIS*{: .small} family. Her children are growing up fatherless and isolated from the rest of society, unable to attend Iraqi schools. “People look at us differently,” another woman in the sector told me. “Even small children in the camp point at my children and say, ‘*ISIS*{: .small}! *ISIS*{: .small}!’ ” The government refuses to recognize or replace Umm Saleh’s infant son’s birth certificate, because it was issued by the Islamic State; as with tens of thousands of other Iraqi children, his own country has rendered him effectively stateless. The camp is now Umm Saleh’s de-facto prison; Iraqi security forces stole her identity card at a checkpoint, and without it she cannot leave.\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: /photos/5c12cc9aef12204ae0c06030]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nAt night, Umm Saleh and the other women in her sector try to avoid the camp toilets, which are unlit, to minimize the chances of being raped by guards. Members of armed groups routinely enter the camp to harass them, rob them, assault them, or burn down their tents. One night, three Hashd fighters raped a young woman named Amani while she was washing inside her tent. “One of them had a shop that I used to visit in Shirqat,” she told me. “Another was my neighbor.” During the attack, they berated her for her *ISIS*{: .small} affiliation.\n\nAmani was abandoned at birth, grew up in an orphanage, and married when she was around fourteen. Two years later, *ISIS*{: .small} came to Shirqat. Her husband joined, and forced Amani to move with him to Mosul. She was miserable; she hated having to cover her face in public. She became pregnant, and soon afterward her husband went to fight in the Makhoul Mountains, where he met and married another woman. A few months later, he fled with his new bride to Syria, and divorced Amani by phone. She deleted his number and escaped from *ISIS*{: .small} territory. When she reached Qayyarah, she tried to legally divorce her husband, but wasn’t able to, because her I.D. had expired and her husband wasn’t present. The Iraqi government refuses to issue her a new I.D., because it considers her an *ISIS*{: .small} wife. Without documentation, she has no freedom of movement, and is deprived of access to Iraqi civil services. She wants to return to Shirqat, but fears that, even if she made it out of the camp, she would be detained or killed by Hashd fighters or by her former neighbors. “I have not seen happiness at any moment in my life,” Amani said, tears streaming down her cheeks.\n\nIn another sector, a frail, eighty-two-year-old man named Hellou Hamad, who was also from Shirqat, was lying on a filthy mattress, unable to get up. He had been sent to the camp more than a year ago, because three of his sons had joined the Islamic State. “I tried to stop them, but they were bored and single and jobless,” he told me. The surrounding tents were populated by his female relatives and their children. Many kids in the camp urinate uncontrollably in the night, as a result of the trauma induced by the war; among the women, there are high rates of suicide. “Our houses were burned—we are rejected by our community,” Hamad told me. “I am the only man in this block. All the others are in prison or dead.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThere are eight camps in the desert near Qayyarah, housing roughly a hundred and fifty thousand people. During the war, most residents were people who had been displaced by the Islamic State. But now the proportion of *ISIS*{: .small}-linked families is growing, as those who are unaffiliated return to their villages. The largest of the facilities is Airstrip Camp, which I visited twice in late August; between my visits, more than eleven hundred *ISIS*{: .small}-linked Iraqi men, women, and children arrived in Qayyarah from a camp in eastern Syria. The journey had taken two days, and the Iraqi government had transported them from the border in open trucks, in hundred-and-fifteen-degree weather, without providing food or water. At least one person died.\n\nAt the entrance to Airstrip Camp, down a long, unpaved road, men holding machine guns stood in the shade of a cinder-block hut, near a tattered Iraqi flag. Inside were tents covered in dust—blue canvas turned a deep brown, held to the ground with rope and sandbags caked in mud. Clotheslines and gullies of green sewage separated the tents, and the camp’s razor-wire fence had caught thousands of plastic bags, which thrashed noisily in the breeze. Children hauled wheelbarrows and carts filled with water jugs and sacks of grain. On the horizon, a surveillance balloon floated above Qayyarah’s air base, from which the U.S. military had staged much of the Mosul campaign.\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\n\nOne of my visits coincided with that of the country head of a major international N.G.O. “This is set up like a concentration camp,” he said, gesturing at the fence. “All the barbed wire, the division of sectors. There are no social spaces. There are no spaces for the children to play. There are no places for people to gather. There’s one entrance in and out. And have you seen the guys at the entrance? Most of them are from militias.”\n\nThroughout Nineveh Province, camp administrators and workers routinely deprive *ISIS*{: .small}-linked families of food, clean water, and medical services. The N.G.O. country director told me that he had travelled more than two hundred miles from Baghdad, “to make sure that our Iraqi staff are not falling into these types of revenge attitudes.” He added, “They say, ‘These people killed my family, and now I have to help them?’ ” In some camps, humanitarian workers offer aid in exchange for sex. Many women are pregnant from having been raped by the security forces or from having sex to feed themselves and their children. Although the fighting has ended, “these camps are meant to stay,” the N.G.O. director said. “If you are ten years old now, and you have no food, no assistance, and your mother has to prostitute herself to survive, and the whole of Iraqi society blames you because you were close to *ISIS*{: .small}—in two, three, four years, what are you going to do? It’s clear. The seeds for the next conflict are all here.”\n\nAt a police compound in West Mosul, I asked a colonel named Mezhar Sedoon whether he thought that the camps are creating more security problems than they are solving. “Some of the mothers in the camp are raising *ISIS*{: .small} children, but others have become prostitutes,” he said. He laughed. “Money-money, fucky-fucky!” he said in English. “I’d rather they become whores than raise terrorists!”\n\nSome women try to carry out abortions inside their tents. Others give birth, and discard the babies in unpopulated parts of the camp. Those who are found alive often end up in the care of Sukaina Mohammad Ali Younnis, an Iraqi government official who is in charge of women’s and children’s issues in Mosul. Over tea in Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, she showed me hundreds of photographs of children she has found in camps, on the streets, and dead in trash cans. Earlier this year, she saw someone throw a bundle out of a car, and found that it was a baby boy. She showed me a video of herself cradling him in the back of an ambulance, as blood bubbled out of his nostrils. He died on the way to the hospital.\n\nOutside the camps, thousands of other children have been abandoned or orphaned by the war. Many of them were born to Yazidi women who had been kidnapped by *ISIS*{: .small} and forced into sexual slavery. “After *ISIS*{: .small}, the Yazidis accepted the women back into the community, but not their half-*ISIS*{: .small} babies,” Younnis said. “They force the women to turn over their children to the orphanage. Every day, these women call me, wanting to know how their children are doing.”\n\nHundreds of small children are living in Iraqi prisons. Those whose parents were foreign fighters are often present in the courtroom when their mothers are sentenced to death. Iraqi children whom *ISIS*{: .small} trained to become fighters and potential suicide bombers are imprisoned, as if their lives were irredeemable. “They are useless in interrogations—they just cry,” the senior Iraqi intelligence official said. “We are holding children as young as twelve in cells with hard-core jihadi fighters.”\n\nThousands of children in Mosul live on the street, searching through the trash for scrap to sell. “After their parents were killed or imprisoned, their relatives refused to take them in,” Younnis said. “They are seen as tainted, even if they were too young to absorb the ideology.” Many of them hang out in traffic and at checkpoints, choking on dust and diesel, trying to wipe down windshields or sell water and tissues to passing motorists. “They will do anything for fifty dollars,” she said. “I go to many government officials, asking to find ways to help these kids, but they all say, ‘It’s not my area of responsibility.’ ”\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\n\n“The camps are a time bomb,” Younnis continued. “The fathers are in prison or dead. The mothers are being raped. They will raise the kids accordingly, and their sons will seek revenge. This won’t just affect Mosul, or Nineveh, or Iraq. This will affect the whole world.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOne morning in Mosul, I was told that an ardent supporter of *ISIS*{: .small}, who goes by Umm Hamad, wanted to speak with me, in the market by the Saddam neighborhood. All three of her sons had been *ISIS*{: .small} commanders, and were now dead, but she had evaded deportation to the camps. My interpreter and I parked near a vegetable stand, fifty feet from an Iraqi Army checkpoint. There was another checkpoint a couple of hundred feet behind us, and no access to the side streets. For a moment, I wondered if it was a setup. Then two women approached the car, opened the back door, and climbed in.\n\n“I’m still proud of what they did,” Umm Hamad said, of her sons. She doesn’t think of them as having lost—only of having proved that it was possible for a jihadi group to control territory, and to govern. Already, since its defeat in Mosul, *ISIS*{: .small} has set up checkpoints and carried out abductions and assassinations in several Iraqi provinces. Its leadership has reportedly buried large quantities of weapons and cash in tunnels and sand berms, to be unearthed in the years to come. According to the Pentagon, *ISIS*{: .small} is “more capable” now than Al Qaeda in Iraq was at its peak, in 2007, and there are still some thirty thousand fighters operating in Syria and Iraq. Citing the camps, Umm Hamad told me that she expects the Islamic State to return to Mosul. “Not soon, but more powerful than before,” she said.\n\nThe other woman was Umm Hamad’s niece. She was in her twenties, and spoke softly and wistfully of the past. “Everyone in my family welcomed the Islamic State, except my youngest brother,” she said. “He hated them.” Throughout the occupation, she and her other brothers had tried to convince him of the merits of the caliphate, to no avail. Then he was arrested by the Iraqi security forces, under suspicion of *ISIS*{: .small} affiliation. He was twelve years old. She has no idea where he is, or when he will get out of prison—she knows only that, if the government doesn’t kill him, by the time it lets him go it will have taught him that she was right. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5907ef12019dfc3494e9c8f2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"A Reporter at Large","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"a-reporter-at-large"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8464e65be2f29d55e8b","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Ben Taub joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2017.

In the eighteen-hundreds, European explorers arrived at the marshy banks of a vast body of freshwater in Central Africa. Because locals referred to the area as _chad_, the Europeans called the wetland Lake Chad, and drew it on maps. But _chad_ simply meant “lake” in a local dialect. To the lake’s east, there was a swath of sparsely populated territory—home to several African kingdoms and more than a hundred and fifty ethnic groups. It was mostly desert. In the early nineteen-hundreds, France conquered the area, called it Chad, and declared it part of French Equatorial Africa.\n\nA few years later, a French Army captain described Lake Chad, which was dotted with hundreds of islands, as an ecological wonder and its inhabitants as “dreaded islanders, whose daring flotillas spread terror” along the mainland. “Their audacious robberies gave them the reputation of being terrible warriors,” he wrote. After his expeditions, the islanders were largely ignored. “There was never a connection between the people who live in the islands and the rest of Chad,” Dimouya Souapebe, a government official in the Lake Region, told me.\n\nMoussa Mainakinay was born in 1949 on Bougourmi, a dusty sliver in the lake’s southern basin. Throughout his childhood and teen-age years, he never went hungry. The cows were full of milk. The islands were thick with vegetation. The lake was so deep that he couldn’t swim to the bottom, and there were so many fish that he could grab them with his hands. The lake had given Mainakinay and his ancestors everything—they drank from it, bathed in it, fished in it, and wove mats and baskets and huts from its reeds.\n\nIn the seventies, Mainakinay noticed that the lake was receding. There had always been dramatic fluctuations in water level between the rainy and the dry seasons, but now it was clear that the mainland was encroaching. Floating masses of reeds and water lilies began to clog the remaining waterways, making it impossible to navigate old trading routes between the islands.\n\nLake Chad is the principal life source of the Sahel, a semiarid band that spans the width of Africa and separates the Sahara, in the north, from the savanna, in the south. Around a hundred million people live there. For the next two decades, the entire region was stricken with drought and famine. The rivers feeding into Lake Chad dried up, and the islanders noticed a permanent decline in the size and the number of fish.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5a15e898c7f4893539239ad8]||||||\n+++\n\nThen a plague of tsetse flies descended on the islands. They feasted on the cows, transmitting a disease that made them sickly and infertile, and unable to produce milk. For the first time in Mainakinay’s life, the islanders didn’t have enough to eat. The local medicine man couldn’t make butter, which he would heat up and pour into people’s nostrils as a remedy for common ailments. Now, when the islanders were sick or malnourished, he wrote Quranic verses in charcoal on wooden boards, rinsed God’s words into a cup of lake water, and gave them the cloudy mixture to drink. By the end of the nineties, the lake, once the size of New Jersey, had shrunk by roughly ninety-five per cent, and much of the northern basin was lost to the desert. People started dying of hunger.\n\n\nIn 2003, when Mainakinay was fifty-four years old, he became the chief of Bougourmi. He was proud of his position, but not that proud; his grandfather had presided over more than four hundred islands—until the government stripped the Mainakinays of their authority as Chiefs of the Canton, a position that they had held for more than two hundred years. The center of power was moved to the town of Bol, on the mainland. The islanders were of the Boudouma tribe; the mainlanders were Kanembou. They didn’t get along.\n\nOther political developments were more disruptive. Colonial administrators had drawn the boundaries of Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria, and Niger right through tiny circles of huts on the islands. When these nations enforced their borders, the fishermen and cattle herders of Bougourmi, which is in Chad, were cut off from the lake’s biggest market, which is in Baga, on the Nigerian shoreline. In the mid-aughts, hungry and desperate, they turned to foraging in the bush for fruit and nuts. Then they began to run out of fruit and nuts.\n\n“These were our problems before,” Mainakinay told me, in late July, as he sat on the ground inside a reed hut. He wore a white robe over his bony shoulders, and his dark-brown eyes were turning blue at the edges, fading with age. “It was only recently that our real suffering began.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOne night in 2015, Mainakinay saw flames coming from the huts on Médi Kouta, less than a mile away. For the past several years, Boko Haram had sought to establish a caliphate in northeastern Nigeria. Mainakinay had heard of the group on his shortwave radio. Now, after spreading out along the lake, into southern Niger and northern Cameroon, Boko Haram had come to the Chadian islands and begun kidnapping entire villages, replenishing its military ranks and collecting new wives, children, farmers, and fishermen to sustain its campaigns. At dawn, Mainakinay led the people of Bougourmi to a neighboring island to hide. But Boko Haram continued its attacks, and so, for the first time, Mainakinay’s people sought refuge on the mainland, leaving their cattle and belongings behind.\n\nThe jihadis encountered little resistance in Lake Chad. Most islands had no more than a couple of hundred inhabitants, and their machetes and fishing tools were no match for Boko Haram’s grenades and assault rifles. When the militants arrived on Médi Kouta, they set fire to the mosque and beheaded a few men; after that, the terrified islanders followed the fighters into wooden boats and paddled west, to Nigeria and Niger. As they moved farther away from the Chadian side of the lake, the captives noticed that some islands were already flying the jihadis’ black flag.\n\nThat spring, a few thousand Boudouma fled to the Chadian mainland, near Bol. The United Nations, anticipating military operations in the islands by Chad against Boko Haram, contacted the government. “We met with the minister of defense and the chief of the Army, and urged them to let us know what they’re planning,” Florent Méhaule, the head of the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Chad, told me.\n\nChad is a weak state with a strong military, known for its brutal treatment of combatants and civilians. In late July, without notifying the U.N., the Chadian Army ordered an evacuation of all islands in the southern basin, warning that anyone who was still there in a week would be considered a member of Boko Haram. Around fifty-five thousand islanders rushed to the mainland. The Boudouma have an extensive history of raiding the Kanembou, and the Chief of the Canton did not allow them into the towns. According to Méhaule, “He just told them, ‘Go stay in the empty land between villages. The humanitarians, in their white vans, will come.’ ”\n\nThe evacuation of the southern basin took place just before the harvest, so Boko Haram collected whatever millet, wheat, and maize the islanders had left behind. By the end of November, the Chadian Army had swept through the northern basin, forcibly displacing more than a hundred and ten thousand people in total. They ended up scattered among roughly a hundred and forty spontaneous sites across a vast, inhospitable terrain. “People were everywhere—in places we did not know,” Méhaule said. Because Boko Haram had used boats to attack the islands, the Chadian government banned the use of fishing boats, so the Boudouma had virtually nothing to eat. Without sufficient pasture, many of the Boudoumas’ cattle died.\n\nMéhaule and his colleagues set off in convoys of white Toyota Highlanders, searching for the displacement sites. There were no roads or signs, no paths to follow. “All of our maps were wrong, because they were from the nineteen-seventies,” Méhaule told me. “We were driving through areas that should have been underwater, but we couldn’t even see the lake.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn recent years, the Lake Chad region has become the setting of the world’s most complex humanitarian disaster, devastated by converging scourges of climate change, violent extremism, food insecurity, population explosion, disease, poverty, weak statehood, and corruption.\n\nThe battle against Boko Haram spans the borders of four struggling countries. It is being waged by soldiers who answer to separate chains of command and don’t speak the same languages as one another, or as their enemies, or as the civilians, in the least developed and least educated region on earth.\n\n+++interactive\n[#iframe: https://www.newyorker.com/projects/interactive/2017/171120-chad-gallery/map/index.html](100%x500px)\n+++\n\nAcross the Sahel, millions of people are displaced, and millions more are unable to find work. The desert is expanding; water is becoming more scarce, and so is arable land. According to the U.N., the region’s population, which has doubled in the past few decades, is expected to double again in the next twenty years.\n\nThe Sahel is rife with weapons and insurgencies, and some states are beginning to collapse. In recent years, cattle herders and farmers have started killing one another over access to shrinking pastures—the number of deaths exceeds fifteen thousand, rivalling that inflicted by Boko Haram.\n\nWestern countries and the United Nations have been trying to stabilize local governments. Since the early aughts, the U.S. has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on strengthening Sahelian security forces, in a bid to limit the spread of jihadism in the region’s vast, ungoverned spaces. But this strategy fails to take into account the complex cruelties of colonialism and the predatory nature of the regimes that have developed in its place. Across the Sahel, many people experience no benefits from statehood, only neglect and violence. “What we are actually doing is making the predator more capable,” a European security official told me. “And that’s just stunningly shortsighted.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAfter France took over Chad, it learned that the territory lacked the riches that colonial powers had discovered elsewhere in West and Central Africa. France sent its least experienced and worst-behaved officers there—often as a kind of punishment—and, in the ensuing decades, French military campaigns disrupted trade routes and local economies, contributing to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people from famine. The French focussed their attention on the forced production of cotton, in a fertile part of southern Chad that they referred to as “le Tchad Utile”—Useful Chad.\n\nIn 1958, French Equatorial Africa split up, and two years later Chad became an independent state. The country’s borders had been determined by colonial agreements, and many Chadians couldn’t communicate with one another—there were at least a hundred and twenty indigenous languages. Some Chadians in remote areas were unaware that their villages now belonged to a state.\n\n+++interactive\n+++feature-large\n\n[#iframe: https://www.newyorker.com/projects/interactive/2017/171120-chad-gallery/gallery/index.html](100%x1400px)\n\n+++\n+++\n\nThe country spent the next several decades “suspended between creation and destruction,” as the South African historian Sam Nolutshungu writes, in “[Limits of Anarchy: Intervention and State Formation in Chad](https://www.amazon.com/Limits-Anarchy-Intervention-Formation-Institute/dp/0813916283/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1511796588&sr=1-1&keywords=Limits%20of%20Anarchy:%20Intervention%20and%20State%20Formation%20in%20Chad).” It was “aberrant, marginal, a fictive state,” a country that existed, “even in its peaceful moments, alternately under a cloud of contingent anarchy or tyranny.”\n\nChad was constantly threatened from the north. Libya’s dictator, Muammar Qaddafi, aimed to form what he called a “Great Islamic State of the Sahel,” and he repeatedly sponsored attempts to topple Chad’s leaders. The French usually supported whichever autocrat or warlord was in power. Chad’s institutions were propped up by French investors and advisers, and hardly extended beyond the capital, N’Djamena. The illusion of Chadian statehood was useful for France and the United States, who saw a strong Chadian Army as a means with which to cripple Qaddafi’s ambitions.\n\nHissène Habré became President in 1982, in a revolt sponsored by the C.I.A. He had led three violent rebellions and held Europeans hostage, and yet the moment he took the capital he inherited all the international structures of legitimacy afforded to any head of state. Habré ran a vicious security state, with secret detention centers, that tortured and executed tens of thousands of its citizens. But Habré despised Libya’s leader; because of this, the U.S., under Ronald Reagan, supplied him with hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of weapons. In 1983, Qaddafi invaded northern Chad, using Soviet tanks. In theory, France and the U.S. were no longer backing a warlord. They were helping a President preserve the territorial integrity of his nation.\n\nHabré’s soldiers fought Qaddafi’s forces in a fleet of Toyota Hiluxes supplied by the C.I.A. In what became known as the Toyota War, the Chadian Army killed thousands of Libyan fighters.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5a15e898d59ac141e6cdd4ae]||||||\n+++\n\nIn 1987, as Qaddafi withdrew his troops, Reagan invited Habré to the White House and praised his commitment to “building a better life for the Chadian people.” Then Habré resumed slaughtering ethnic minorities who protested his rule. He also accused three of his highest-ranking officials of plotting a military coup. Two of them were captured and killed. The third, a young colonel named Idriss Déby, fled east to Sudan, and recruited others to join him in a rebellion. Déby also went to Libya, where Qaddafi supplied him with cash and weapons. The next year, Déby’s group drove back across the desert. Habré fled into Cameroon, and Déby became the President of Chad.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIt was December 2, 1990\\. To be Chadian was to be born into a territory where you had a fifteen-per-cent chance of dying before your first birthday. In a country of five million, there were five hospitals, and a few dozen qualified doctors. People routinely died of malaria, cholera, and starvation. The average citizen lived to thirty-nine.\n\nTwo days later, Déby gave his first public speech. “I have brought you neither gold nor silver but liberty!” he said. “No more military campaigns. No more prisons.” He claimed that he was “determined to lead Chad, with the participation of all its citizens, to the system of government longed for by all: a system of government based on democracy.” He paused. “I mean, democracy _in its fullest sense_.” It was a telling slip: a new constitution enshrined freedoms of religion, expression, demonstration, and the press, but, in the years that followed, people who tried to exercise those rights often disappeared.\n\nChad’s economy was nearly nonexistent. Many Chadians—including former and current rebels, soldiers, and police officers—resorted to highway banditry to survive. After Déby told gendarmes that bandits “should be shot down like a dog,” some officials held public mass executions of suspected criminals, without trials. One day in 1996, gendarmes in N’Djamena arrested an elementary-school student who had stolen food from his neighbors. They put a bag over his head, shot him, and abandoned his body on the banks of the Chari River.\n\nTen days later, Déby met with representatives from several fledgling Chadian human-rights organizations. He told them that the killings were “in accordance with the wishes of public opinion.” Otherwise, Déby has left his citizens in total neglect. The _Irish Times_ reported that, outside the capital, Chadians were eating boiled leaves and animal feed, and digging up anthills to search for whatever grains the insects had dragged home. “This country is a bit of a police state, but mostly a pirate ship,” the European security official told me. “That’s the sense that I get when I’m here—that I’m on a pirate ship, and the captain is always drunk.”\n\nDéby’s security forces used military planes supplied by the U.S. and France, and maintained by American and French technicians, to transport political prisoners. The French also supplied Déby’s regime with money, trucks, fuel, communications systems, and handcuffs—resources that, according to Amnesty International, had been “diverted from their original purpose to be used for execution and torture.” Although French military advisers stationed at Chadian outposts had witnessed human-rights abuses, they did not intervene, saying that it was not their responsibility to come between the state and its people.\n\nSince Déby took power, his forces have put down numerous rebellions and coups. In 2006, Déby and the President of Sudan sponsored insurrections against each other. The Chadian rebels made it all the way to N’Djamena. French soldiers helped stabilize the capital, but near the Sudanese border the Chadian Army forcibly conscripted children. “Déby has trouble finding soldiers who are willing to fight for him,” a senior Chadian military officer told Human Rights Watch. “Child soldiers are ideal, because they don’t complain, they don’t expect to be paid, and, if you tell them to kill, they kill.”\n\nIn 2008, Congress passed a law that banned American military support for governments that used child soldiers. But President Barack Obama secured a waiver for Chad, arguing that it was “in the national interest” of the United States to train and equip Chad’s military. Al Qaeda’s message was taking root in parts of Africa where nation-states had been sloppily crafted and poorly ruled. The war on terror had reached the Sahel.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAround that time, Mohammed Yusuf, a young Salafi preacher in northeastern Nigeria, was delivering sermons about the ruinous legacy of colonialism and the corruption of Nigeria’s élites. After decades of political turbulence and military coups, oil extraction had made Nigeria the richest country in Africa, and yet the percentage of people living in total poverty was growing each year. “The Europeans created the situation in which we find ourselves today,” Yusuf said. It was easy to appeal to the existential grievances of northern Nigeria’s marginalized, unemployed youth. Yusuf told them that the only way forward was to install a caliphate in Nigeria. His followers, who became known as Boko Haram, revived a tradition of jihadism in northern Nigeria that goes back hundreds of years.\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: /photos/5a15e898ede9dd5e78c6bdc3]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nOn June 11, 2009, police officers at a checkpoint in Nigeria stopped a group of Boko Haram members on their way to a funeral; in the confrontation that followed, officers opened fire and injured seventeen jihadis. The next month, around sixty Boko Haram members attacked a police station. Gun battles erupted in several towns, and Yusuf was arrested. A few hours later, the police executed him and dumped his body outside the station. A video of the mutilated corpse, still in handcuffs, went viral. Violence exploded all over northern Nigeria: at least seven hundred people were killed in the first week. Yusuf’s deputy, Abubakar Shekau, became the leader of Boko Haram.\n\nShekau dispatched some of his followers to train with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. When they returned, the group detonated car bombs in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja. Propaganda videos show Shekau double-fisting Kalashnikovs and screaming incoherently as he fires bullets into the sky. In 2012, after leading a rampage in the Nigerian city of Kano, he said, “I enjoy killing anyone whom God commands me to kill, the way I enjoy killing chickens and rams.” Shekau’s fighters terrorized remote villages, tossing grenades into huts and burning down mosques. They raped women, slaughtered men, and kidnapped children, whom they forced to carry out suicide bombings. Shekau pledged his group’s allegiance to the Islamic State, but his battlefield tactics were so depraved that *ISIS*{: .small} eventually disowned him. Young men who joined Boko Haram were sent back to their villages to recruit their families. As a teen-age fighter explained to me, “If your family doesn’t come, you have to kill them, because they have chosen to be infidels.”\n\nThe Nigerian security forces responded with a series of massacres that drove villagers into the insurgency. One day in 2013, after Boko Haram killed a Nigerian soldier near Baga, on the muddy western shores of Lake Chad, government troops stormed into the town, lit thatched huts on fire, and shot villagers as they tried to escape. Some villagers tried to swim to the islands and drowned in the lake. Roughly two hundred people are thought to have died, and more than two thousand structures were burned.\n\nOn January 3, 2015, Boko Haram returned to Baga and attacked a local military base. The soldiers shed their uniforms and fled into the bush, leaving behind weapons, vehicles, and ammunition. During the next four days, Boko Haram slaughtered civilians in Baga and the surrounding villages. “It was impossible to know how many people they killed,” a survivor told me. “I just saw bodies in the streets. Everyone was running.” Thousands of people made for the islands of Lake Chad. Boko Haram followed them.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nMany islanders were open to Boko Haram. The Boudouma used Nigerian currency, and for decades those who could afford to had been sending their children to study with Quranic tutors in northern Nigeria. A few years ago, some of those children started calling their siblings and friends, urging them to leave the islands and join Boko Haram. “They told me that if I join them I will go to paradise,” a sixteen-year-old Boudouma told me. “They also said that, at their camp in Nigeria, there are buckets full of money, and you can just take as much as you want. So I followed them.”\n\nDimouya Souapebe, the government official, said that “it was easy for Boko Haram to come in from Nigeria and poison people’s minds,” by promising access to basic services and Islamic education. “The islanders never had a school. They’ve never had sanitation. They drink the same lake water they defecate in. Out in the islands, there is nothing.”\n\nAs a first line of defense on the mainland, the Chadian governor of the Lake Region set up “vigilance committees,” with the help of tribal chiefs. Given Chad’s history of rebellion, the governor was wary of allowing vigilantes to carry weapons, but he distributed cell phones to young men so that they could alert the authorities.\n\nOn a Tuesday evening in December, 2015, some months after Moussa Mainakinay and his villagers fled Bougourmi, a contact living on a jihadi-controlled island warned him that Boko Haram was planning to attack the market in Bol, the biggest town on the Chadian side of the lake. That night, Mainakinay and a group of vigilantes stood guard, looking for boats. Eventually, they spotted a canoe moving toward them, containing several men and women. When it reached the shore, a few of the passengers detonated suicide vests, killing most of the others. Flesh and cloth rained down. A teen-age girl collapsed screaming; the explosion had mangled her legs.\n\nThe vigilantes took her to the hospital in Bol, a small concrete building with rudimentary supplies. Someone roused Sam Koulmini, one of only two doctors in Bol. (The other is his wife.) “Boko Haram told the girl that the explosives wouldn’t hurt her—that, if she killed some people in the market, they’d give her money when she got back,” Koulmini told me. That night, he amputated her right leg and one of her damaged fingers.\n\nFor the next several days, she was kept in an isolated room, guarded by gendarmes. During her time with Boko Haram, she had become addicted to tramadol, an opioid painkiller that is widely abused in the region. “A macro-dose of tramadol makes you feel as if you’re in the clouds,” Koulmini explained. “You’re afraid of nothing. Pretty much all the young people are taking it.” The injured girl showed severe symptoms of withdrawal; held in isolation, he says, “she became psychotic.” On the second day, she started smearing feces all over her body.\n\nThe gendarmes wouldn’t let Koulmini visit his patient more than once a day, and they rushed him as he changed the dressings on her wounds. By the time he noticed that there were still pieces of shrapnel inside her left leg, it was too late; the limb was gangrenous. He had to cut that leg off, too.\n\n+++feature-xsmall\n[#image: /photos/5a15e8984595002af4df7ad6]|||\n|||\n+++\n\n-=-=-=\n\nBefore Boko Haram invaded the islands, humanitarian groups in Chad were preoccupied elsewhere, dealing with nationwide health and malnutrition crises, and with refugee crises near Chad’s borders with Sudan and the Central African Republic. “We all had to open very quickly,” Méhaule, of the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told me. But the Lake Region was so poor and undeveloped that it was hard to distinguish the needs of the displaced islanders from those of mainland villagers. “Some of the displaced, for example, own a huge quantity of cattle,” he said. In the short term, they may be better off than people who have shelter but no food.\n\nIn late July, I flew from N’Djamena on an aging propeller plane that, twice a week, takes humanitarians and supplies to Bol. From the sky, I could see black smudges, clustered circles in the sand—remnants of burned-out villages. The movement of people and cows had left faint tracks across the islands and through the reeds and lily pads that filled the waterways between them.\n\nFor the next week, I travelled through the Lake Region with two *UNICEF*{: .small} employees and the photographer Paolo Pellegrin. The Chadian government was kept informed of our activities and movements; each time we arrived in a different jurisdiction, *UNICEF*{: .small} scheduled a “courtesy visit” with the local authorities, and gave them copies of our papers and photographs.\n\nThere are no roads in the region, so we followed in the tracks of vehicles belonging to the military and to other N.G.O.s—up sandy hills, past millet patches and goat pens made of gnarled roots and thorny vines. The pens rarely had any goats in them. We rattled downhill into flat, dark-brown depressions that, until recently, had been part of the lake bed. There, people were digging for natron, a mineral ash that’s put into camel feed; the going rate for a hundred-pound bag of natron is less than three dollars. According to Méhaule, the soil left by the lake’s receding waters is so rich that, properly farmed, it could grow enough food to sustain everyone who’s currently starving next to it. But the Chief of the Canton has refused to give displaced Boudouma access to arable plots.\n\nAs we drove, we would suddenly come across a reed hut. Then another would come into view, then a hundred more—each big enough for three or four people to lie down in. We would pass a metal billboard announcing the name of the displacement site, as well as the organizations and the countries who were funding some of its needs. Here was the *UNICEF*{: .small}-backed well. Over there was the Oxfam one, where children were using their full weight to pull down the lever. Then there was the sign announcing a “joint education project,” paid for by Handicap International, Cooperazione Internazionale, and the Swiss Confederation—although we saw no schools. In certain ways, the displacement sites offer an improvement over life in the islands. Every so often, representatives of international organizations arrive to vaccinate the cows; build a well; talk to the women about health issues; and weigh the children and measure their upper arms, to calculate the level of malnutrition. At one site, I met a woman whose hands had been blown off when Boko Haram threw a grenade into her hut. She had been nine months pregnant, with her seventh child, but after the attack she miscarried. When her husband saw her condition, he left her, sold their last cow, and remarried within two weeks. Having fled the islands, she is now regularly visited by a mental-health professional.\n\nStill, on the Chadian side of the lake, it is better to be any nationality but Chadian. Just outside Baga Sola, the second-largest town in the Lake Region, there is a camp for displaced Nigerians. Around five thousand people live there, most of whom fled the massacre in Baga, across the lake. Because they crossed an international border, they have refugee status, which makes them eligible for funding and legal protections that are not available to the internally displaced. The Nigerian camp has a school with large classrooms, blackboards, chalk, and wooden desks. There’s an outdoor basketball court, with floodlights; indoor latrines are a short walk away. Police officers patrol the camp, which is divided into sixteen neatly spaced blocks of roomy, waterproof tents. “The security is good here, and we have enough food,” a teen-age girl told me. “I am getting an education for the first time. Why would I want to go back to Nigeria?”\n\nNo such amenities exist in the sites for internally displaced Chadians, or even in the Kanembou villages. One morning, a heavy rainstorm flooded Baga Sola. Goats huddled against a mud wall to avoid the wind. When the storm lifted, I went to the Kafia displacement site, which is home to a few thousand Boudouma. Everyone was soaked. Several reed huts had collapsed; their remnants were strewn across a desolate, sandy landscape. A camel gnawed at a prickly tree. “We eat one meal per day, at most,” a Boudouma chief told me. “Often we eat nothing.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAfter Boko Haram attacked Baga, each country bordering the lake supplied a couple of thousand soldiers to an effort called the Multi-National Joint Task Force, which receives intelligence from Western partners. But coöperation among the countries is fragile. One day, at the task-force base in N’Djamena, I met the commander, a wiry, deadly serious Nigerian major general named Leo Irabor. He sat at an imposing desk, with a wall of maps behind him. I told him that I hoped to embed with his troops and to travel north of the lake, west through the desert into Niger, and then south into Nigeria. “It is a fine idea,” Irabor said. “But it is not possible,” because the M.N.J.T.F. doesn’t conduct cross-border operations. The military sectors are divided along national boundaries, and the countries have a history of mistrust—especially between the government of anglophone Nigeria and those of the other countries, which are francophone. Soldiers can pursue militants across borders, if necessary, but only Boko Haram fights as if the borders don’t exist. “None of the partner countries want to end up shouldering most of the burden,” a Western military adviser to the M.N.J.T.F. told me, with a shrug. “We can’t want it to work more than they do.”\n\nThe M.N.J.T.F. doesn’t fight for new ground in the islands during the rainy season—the weather can damage vehicles and leave fighters stranded—but, in the past two dry seasons, it has taken significant territory back from Boko Haram, spurring defections. Last year, on August 25th, seven Boudouma men and one woman showed up at an M.N.J.T.F. checkpoint in Chad, near the border with Nigeria. For more than a year, they had been living with Boko Haram; now they wanted to come home. By the end of 2016, around three hundred men and seven hundred women and children had returned. They were kept in military detention in Baga Sola while the government figured out what to do with them.\n\nEventually, all the women and children were let go, and it fell to the U.N. to reunite them with other people from their villages among the scattered displacement sites. “There was a big risk that they wouldn’t be welcome—that they would be stigmatized or retaliated against,” Méhaule, of *OCHA*{: .small}, said. “But the reintegration was surprisingly easy.”\n\n+++feature-large\n[#image: /photos/5a15e898c7f4893539239ad7]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nOne afternoon, at the Mélea displacement site, near Bol, I met a twelve-year-old boy whom I’ll call Aboudou. He looked about half his age. He wore ragged green pants, a filthy shirt, and, despite the scorching temperatures, a yellow woollen hat, which he pulled down over his eyes whenever he started to cry. His face was marked with the traditional scarification of the Boudouma—a deep cut down the center of the nose, and diagonal marks on each cheek—and his skin was so taut that you could see his jaw muscles move when he spoke.\n\nAboudou, his parents, and his four younger siblings had been kidnapped by Boko Haram, during the attack on Médi Kouta, near Bougourmi. The family had canoed with the jihadis for two weeks, until they reached the island of Boka, in southern Niger, where his mother and father built a house out of red water lilies. Each day, Aboudou and several hundred other children were given religious lessons by a man named Mal Moussa, who, Aboudou said, taught them that “if you kill an infidel, you will go to paradise.”\n\nLife on Boka was hard. Sometimes Aboudou’s mother would try to talk to him about the abduction, but if someone else came near she quickly changed the subject. Most nights, his father disappeared, and he didn’t know why. People who disobeyed orders were beheaded. Eventually, the island ran out of food, and they moved to another one, to harvest maize.\n\nOne day, airplanes came and bombed all the huts. A piece of shrapnel pierced Aboudou’s shoulder. He had fifteen friends on the island, but when the attack was over all of them were dead. After that, his family fled to Chad, where they were detained by the military. He was much more afraid of the uniformed soldiers than he was of Boko Haram.\n\nAboudou’s mother confirmed his account. When I asked whether her husband had participated in jihadi raids on the nights he disappeared, she said she didn’t know. “He never told me what he did, and I never asked,” she said. When I asked to speak with him, she said that it was impossible—he was on his way to the market. But he had brought Aboudou to me a few hours earlier, and now I saw him, about fifty feet away, staring at us from his hut.\n\nThe Chadian military didn’t know what to do with the returning men. Many of them had received weapons training from Boko Haram, and some had carried out attacks. Méhaule advised the government to screen them, identify and prosecute perpetrators of crimes, and let the others go. “But the government had no capacity to do this,” he told me. “It’s expensive to feed three hundred people, so, in January, they just released them. All of them.”\n\nThis year, several hundred more people have returned. “Those who had left to join Boko Haram learned that the humanitarian community is here, giving people food to eat, giving people money,” Souapebe, the government official, told me. “That’s why people started coming back.” To encourage further defections, he said, “I buy phone credit for the local boys. Then they call their friends in Boko Haram and tell them, ‘We’re O.K. We have food. We have shelter. The humanitarians have given us blankets.’ ” He continued, “When someone is no longer hungry, he is no longer dangerous.”\n\nOne of the boys who had voluntarily joined Boko Haram came back to Chad because, he told me, “Boko Haram lied to us about the money. All I saw was poverty and death.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOn the morning of July 22nd, we set off by boat in the direction of Médi Kouta. The chief of the island, a seventy-two-year-old Boudouma named Hassan Mbomi, met us at the shoreline and guided us uphill, through a grove of charred palm trees. He had returned to the island twenty days earlier, to try to grow millet, because he was starving on the mainland. About two hundred people had followed him. “When we got back, everything was burned,” he said. “We have to build our village from scratch.” A large group of men were waiting for us in a dusty clearing, but Mbomi said I couldn’t speak to them. He said that they had been kidnapped by Boko Haram and forcibly conscripted into the jihad before escaping.\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: /photos/5a15e898f3c8fd27fc66230f]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nTo comply with U.N. safety rules, we were accompanied into the islands by a Chadian soldier named Suliman. He seemed ill at ease on Médi Kouta, and the people there eyed him with suspicion. When we left the island, Suliman told me that he didn’t accept the chief’s explanation. “Sometimes they go away, sometimes they come back,” he said. “But they are all complicit.” Some jihadis have a branding on their back—a circle with a diagonal line through it—but, in most cases, “we can’t distinguish who is Boko Haram and who isn’t,” Suliman said.\n\nFor two years, Suliman had been fighting in the islands. The Army had no boats. Sometimes his group commandeered fishermen’s pirogues, and he had come to believe that many fishermen worked as spies, alerting Boko Haram to the military’s movements. Like most soldiers, he grew up speaking Chadian Arabic, and cannot communicate with people in the Lake Region. We passed another island lined with burned palm trees. “The jihadis used to come to these islands at night, and we couldn’t see them,” Suliman said. “So we would light the trees on fire, so they wouldn’t come back.” He had torched the trees on Médi Kouta.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWhile I was in Baga Sola, six thousand people showed up near the Dar Nahim displacement site, a few miles from town. They belonged to a nomadic Arab community that has been in Chadian territory for hundreds of years, but they had just come from Niger, where some of them had fled during the Habré regime. Ordinarily, humanitarian workers would classify them as Chadian “returnees.” But national governments get the final word on status, and Déby’s regime insisted that they were Nigérien refugees, deflecting responsibility and costs to the U.N.\n\nBecause governments can decide where the U.N. operates within their national territory, humanitarians are routinely compelled to enter into morally fraught arrangements. In Syria, the U.N. is almost never allowed to deliver food or medicine to besieged civilians who oppose the regime. In Ethiopia, the government has spent the past several decades pressuring N.G.O.s into complying with its coverups of epidemics and a possible famine. In Chad, the International Committee of the Red Cross is the only international organization that has access to prisons. In order to maintain access, the I.C.R.C. keeps any atrocities it sees confidential.\n\nBut more common is the scenario in Lake Chad—in a neglected patch of territory, the international community ends up fulfilling the unwanted obligations of statehood. The regime reaps the benefit: the threats that arise from its failure to govern are mitigated, and its leader is left to focus on the task of strengthening the security apparatus that keeps him in power. As Linda Polman writes, in “[The Crisis Caravan](https://www.amazon.com/Crisis-Caravan-Whats-Wrong-Humanitarian/dp/0312610580/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1511796712&sr=1-1),” from 2010, “If you use enough violence, aid will arrive, and if you use even more violence even more aid will arrive.”\n\nOnce a humanitarian emergency has been stabilized, it is usually followed by extensive development projects, funded by international donors and institutions. “Baga Sola is three times bigger than it was when we all moved in,” Méhaule said. “It’s amazing how the money flowing in from humanitarian assistance has changed the city.” Jihadi activity in areas susceptible to recruitment tends to attract the major Western donor countries, who see development as an instrument of stabilization. But, if Boko Haram were to suddenly disappear, the humanitarian emergency funds would be directed to other crises, in other desperate parts of the world. The people of the lake would be no less vulnerable to environmental degradation and all its consequences, but, as before, they would largely be on their own. Travelling through the Lake Region, I got the impression that almost everyone there—and especially those in the Presidential palace—has a stake in Boko Haram’s continued existence as a distant, manageable threat.\n\nEven so, the assistance has fallen short of the need. This year, the U.N. appealed for a hundred and twenty-one million dollars in aid for the Chadian side of the lake, but only a third of that has appeared. In the northern basin, I met a twenty-seven-year-old man who, three days earlier, had become so hungry that he walked six hours into contested territory in search of fish. Fifteen other men had gone with him; all of them were captured or killed by Boko Haram.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThis past spring, Boudouma men started heading back to the islands in the southern basin, to plant millet and maize before the rainy season. Méhaule’s team followed them. For two years, the Chadian Army had been telling the U.N. that the islands were empty and off limits, but now, he said, “we realized that there were about forty thousand people living there.”\n\nWhen Moussa Mainakinay, the chief of Bougourmi, went home, he could tell that the lake had receded several hundred feet since he left. There were more reeds and water lilies, and more mosquitoes. The lake water was so shallow and full of sediment that drinking it gave him a stomach ache. Boko Haram had taken the cows and the cooking pots, and either the jihadis or the military had burned all the huts. There was nothing left. But, on the mainland, many from Bougourmi had died of malnutrition, and Mainakinay was determined to bring the remaining people home.\n\nAfter a few months, a community worker from Bougourmi named Bokoï Saleh arranged for a vaccine delivery to the island. The vaccines would inoculate children against measles, tetanus, polio, and tuberculosis. *Unicef*{: .small} paid for the transport logistics.\n\nSaleh picked up the vaccines at the hospital in Bol and, with the help of a friend, hauled them into a pirogue. The load weighed more than six hundred pounds, split among several large coolers. The two men rowed the pirogue from the mainland to a nearby island called Yga, where they borrowed five donkeys to transport the vaccines to the other side of the island. The walk took forty minutes. At the shoreline, there were two hippopotamuses, making it too dangerous to leave. They spent the night there, sleeping on the ground.\n\n+++feature-medium\n[#image: /photos/5a15e898ac3ab35aa8cf2dc0]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nSaleh got up at five o’clock in the morning. It was hot and humid, and he was worried that the coolers might not keep the vaccines fresh for much longer. The hippos were gone, but, during the night, a floating island of reeds and water lilies had blocked the area around his boat. Saleh and his friend started hacking through the reeds with machetes. But they were too thick, so the men abandoned the boat and started dragging the coolers across the top of the floating island. It took half an hour to go a couple of hundred feet, and they had to keep moving to prevent the vaccines from sinking. When they reached the other side, the water was up to their waists. They waved over another pirogue, loaded up the vaccines, and paddled the rest of the way to Bougourmi.\n\nSaleh relayed this story to me later that day, outside a hut on Bougourmi. He was drooping with exhaustion. A few feet away, the vaccination campaign was in progress. At least a hundred women and children were sitting in the shade under the island’s biggest tree, waiting their turn.\n\nI asked the translator to tell Saleh that I admired what he had done. Saleh frowned. “If *UNICEF*{: .small} had rented me a pirogue with a motor, I could have avoided the hippos and the reeds,” he said. “It would have taken twenty minutes to get here from the mainland.”\n\nHe was right. That’s how *UNICEF*{: .small} had brought me.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn N’Djamena, I came to know a Chadian spy who is close to the President. He sought me out, wanting to confide state secrets; I was nervous that it was a trap. But, at our third meeting, he described the structure of a group of military-intelligence agents whose job it is to spy not _for_ the military but _on_ the military—to look out for anyone plotting a coup. “Things are not good here,” he said. “The soldiers are unhappy.”\n\nDéby’s hold on power is reliant on Western support. The European security official told me that “Déby basically blackmails us, saying, ‘If I fall, there’s a direct line between *ISIS*{: .small} in the north, Boko Haram in the south, and Al Qaeda in the west.’ ” In a bid to prove his worth to international backers, Déby has been renting out the Army to international coalitions, sending Chadians to fight with U.N. forces in Mali and the Central African Republic. But many of those soldiers have not been paid.\n\nThe Chadian economy has become so bad that, in the past year, Déby has repeatedly cut civil servants’ salaries. This summer, he also cut the salaries of his troops, a move that was quickly followed by a carjacking and a spate of armed robberies and shootings in N’Djamena; one humanitarian worker’s stolen handbag turned up on the M.N.J.T.F. base. Chadian infantrymen are now being paid around fifty-eight dollars a month. “The Chadian people are starving for food and for freedom,” the spy said. “I work for the President, but my loyalty is to the Chadian people.”\n\nAugust 11th was Chad’s fifty-seventh Independence Day, and there was a military parade in the Place de la Nation, a vast public square that rarely has any people in it. Déby didn’t show up until three hours after the festivities began. The next time I met up with the Chadian spy, he said that Déby’s military-intelligence officers had inspected every weapon on display before the President’s arrival, to make sure that none of the guns had secretly been loaded.\n\nSince the country’s independence, the French government has routinely sponsored Chadian military officers to train or study in France—including Déby, during the Habré era. Officially, the purpose of the training has been to help professionalize the Army. But it also seems like a kind of insurance policy, a guarantee that whichever officer leads the next successful rebellion will also have some loyalty to France. In recent months, Chadian rebels linked to Déby’s nephew, Timane Erdimi—who led a failed rebellion in 2008, and has been living in exile ever since—have been massing near the Libyan border. “Everyone dreams of being the President,” the spy told me. “I am just biding my time.”\n\nOn most mornings in N’Djamena, French fighter jets roar out of the international airport, to bomb Al Qaeda militants in Mali. The United States has special-operations forces in most Sahelian states, including Chad. The crises of the Sahel have “so many variables that, even in the short term, we don’t have a handle on things,” an American military officer told me.\n\nIn recent months, I have asked many American diplomatic and military officials to define a coherent long-term strategy for the region, but none of them have been able to articulate more than a vague wish: that by improving local governments and institutions, encouraging democratic tendencies, and facilitating development, the international community can defeat terrorism. In Chad, the security-based approach mistakes the strengthening of Déby’s regime for the stabilization of the Chadian state. The strategy is a paradox: in pursuing stability, it strengthens the autocrat, but, in strengthening the autocrat, it enables him to further abuse his position, exacerbating the conditions that lead people to take up arms.\n\nAs part of international antiterror partnerships, security forces are increasingly coming into contact with communities of people who cross international borders every day. Many who fall into this category are nomadic herders; their way of life is fundamentally at odds with the enforcement of legal boundaries, and they are indifferent to the existence of nation-states. If they are denied the freedom to move with the seasons, their cattle will die. In recent years, as the Sahelian climate has worsened, many herders who had bought weapons to protect their animals have turned to jihad.\n\nIt seems likely that, even if Boko Haram is defeated, the rationales for insurgent violence will broaden beyond religion. I asked the European security official whether he thought that, in the future, there will be terrorist groups in the Sahel that carry out attacks in the name of equality instead of jihad. He smiled, and said, “If you examine the lacquer on a wooden table—I think your question is, how thin is that lacquer?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I think it’s pretty thin.” ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1dd12710c62d10815593","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Lake Chad","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"lake-chad"},{"id":"5c2e1c842bc86f2c9a2449b3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Boko Haram","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"boko-haram"},{"id":"5c2e1dd12bc86f2c9a244b1a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Moussa Mainakinay","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"moussa-mainakinay"},{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Terrorism","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"terrorism"},{"id":"5c2e1dd1397f5b30646d0761","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Jihadis","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"jihadis"},{"id":"5c2e1dd141e4c73c088d78d2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Chad Islands","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"chad-islands"},{"id":"5c2e1dd1b75f002c8941e5e2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Chadians","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"chadians"},{"id":"5c2e1c7836cecf40192141c7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Africa","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"africa"}],"sections":[{"id":"5944867342fa443beba19b29","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"A Reporter at Large","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"a-reporter-at-large"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8464e65be2f29d55e8b","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Ben Taub joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2017.

Kelly’s past may soon lead to his indictment in Illinois, according to a senior law-enforcement official. The video shows the singer sexually assaulting an underage girl, the official and two other sources familiar with the tape said. Steve Greenberg, a lawyer who represents Kelly, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last month, Greenberg said, of Kelly, in [an interview with the Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/babf34f43d464b4c9a6f41d0cedaf2d0), “He never knowingly had sex with an underage woman, he never forced anyone to do anything, he never held anyone captive, he never abused anyone.” \n\nIn 2002, Kelly was indicted, in Illinois, on twenty-one counts of child pornography related to a tape made in late 1998 or early 1999, when Kelly was thirty-two years old. The tape, which ran for twenty-six-minutes and thirty-nine seconds, appeared to show Kelly sexually assaulting a fourteen-year-old girl. He was acquitted of those charges, in 2008. \n\nIn early January, Lifetime aired “[Surviving R. Kelly](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/dream-hampton-on-surviving-r-kelly-and-necessary-conversations-about-sexual-abuse-and-race),” a six-hour docu-series that brought renewed attention to reports of predatory behavior by the star, dating back decades. Kelly, now fifty-two, has settled four lawsuits brought by women who have been named in public documents. He married his protégée Aaliyah, who was then fifteen years old, in 1994; the illegal marriage was annulled by her parents, six months later. At the same time, Kelly and Aaliyah signed a settlement agreement prohibiting either of them from speaking about the marriage in public. More recently, Kelly was [accused of keeping “a cult” of women](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jimderogatis/parents-told-police-r-kelly-is-keeping-women-in-a-cult) against their will, and physically and mentally abusing them. (A lawyer representing Kelly suggested that the women who made these recent accusations were “defaming a great artist” and insisted that “Mr. Kelly deserves a personal life.”)\n\nTwo weeks ago, the attorney Michael Avenatti [tweeted](https://twitter.com/michaelavenatti/status/1091158821710508037), “Since April, I have been working on the R. Kelly matter. The results of that work will soon be known. We are going to blow this wide open for the sake of each of his victims and one less pedophile will be free. Count on it.”  After I contacted him, on Thursday morning, Avenatti tweeted [a formal statement](https://twitter.com/MichaelAvenatti/status/1096028386189701120), in which he claimed to be representing “multiple clients in connection with allegations of sexual assault of minors” by Kelly. In the statement, Avenatti said that he had given a forty-five-minute videotape, showing “Kelly engaging in multiple sexual assaults of a girl underage,” to the Cook County state’s attorney, Kim Foxx. Avenatti added, “the time frame of sexual assaults depicted in the video is within the Illinois statute of limitations.”\n\nFoxx would not comment, but a law-enforcement official said that an indictment is pending and Kelly could be arrested soon.\n\nThe videotape related to Kelly’s previous indictment was first given to me, anonymously, on February 1, 2002, when I was a reporter at the Chicago *Sun-Times*. The *Sun-Times* turned it over to police the same day. Prosecutors said that the tape showed Kelly having sex with the niece of a former Kelly protégée, the R. & B. singer Sparkle. The girl was identified by fifteen witnesses for the prosecution, including Sparkle, but the girl and her parents did not testify. The case took six years to go to trial; jurors later said that Kelly was acquitted because the girl and her parents never testified.\n\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\n\nFollowing the initial indictment, there were reports that Kelly had other, similar tapes in his possession. In July, 2002, Kelly was sued by a Kansas City man named Charles Freeman, who alleged that he had been hired by Kelly’s chief private investigator at the time, Jack Palladino, to track down [any videotapes related to Kelly](https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/75052/r-kelly-sued-over-stolen-videotape) that might be “on the streets.” In his lawsuit, Freeman claimed that he had been promised a hundred and forty thousand dollars for his investigation but received only seventy-five thousand.\n\nDuring Kelly’s trial, in 2008, a witness named Lisa Van Allen testified that she met Kelly on the set of a music video that Kelly shot near her home, in Alpharetta, Georgia, in late 1997, and that she began a sexual relationship with him when she was seventeen—a year over the age of consent in Georgia. Van Allen, who was given immunity from prosecution for her testimony, said that she engaged in sexual encounters with Kelly and the girl seen in the tape that had led to Kelly’s indictment. She further testified that, in 2006, she removed a video of a sexual encounter with Kelly from a duffel bag that he had left on the sidelines of a basketball court at a high-end Chicago gym while he was shooting hoops. According to Van Allen, the bag was full of such tapes. “He carried it everywhere with him. Wherever he was at, the bag would follow,” she said. In an interview on Wednesday, she told me, “I just didn’t want that tape out there.” \n\nThe day after Van Allen took the stand, in 2008, Freeman and an associate promised to hold a press conference that would be “big news” and “[reveal all](https://www.vulture.com/2008/06/more_colorful_characters_descend.html).” The press conference never happened. Neither man was called to the stand, and what became of any other videotapes they might have found remained a mystery. Van Allen told me on Wednesday that prosecutors never seemed all that interested in the tape, even though a second video showing Kelly with an underage girl might have led to a conviction. (The girl in the original video has never spoken publicly, nor have her parents, and none of them returned calls on Thursday.)\n\nAfter Van Allen’s testimony at the trial, Kelly’s manager released a statement through Kelly’s spokesman, in which he insisted that “Lisa Van Allen is an admitted thief and a liar, who wouldn’t know the truth if she tripped over it. If there was any crime committed here, it was her attempt to extort money from R. Kelly.” But Kelly’s camp didn’t say anything about the other alleged tape, and no one has mentioned it since.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e2b2bfcc72cd92d06f4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1e2b2bfcc72cd92d06f4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"R.

Kelly](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/r.-kelly) has been a glaring omission. Allegations of abuse have followed R. Kelly for nearly three decades. And, to be clear, his is not the story of a star hooking up with a groupie—Kelly has been accused of running something resembling a cult. Women have said that they were kept in his home as prisoners, suffering physical and emotional abuse, for years. A tape emerged—and was viewed around the country—that seemed to show Kelly molesting a minor. In 2008, he was tried and acquitted on fourteen counts of child pornography. Kelly has denied everything, and by and large his fans and those close to him have stuck by him.\n\nThat may finally be changing because of a six-part documentary series called “[Surviving R. Kelly](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/surviving-r-kelly-reframes-r-kelly-and-the-songs-we-once-loved),” which just aired on Lifetime. A Georgia D.A. is now reportedly investigating Kelly. The *New Yorker* staff writer [Jelani Cobb](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jelani-cobb) [wrote](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/r-kelly-and-the-complexities-of-race-in-the-metoo-era), of the project, “An exposé typically indicts the character of its subject; ‘Surviving R. Kelly’ indicts a public that knew of his character and did nothing about it, a public that constructed an elaborate architecture of denial and has chosen to live in it.” Recently, Cobb sat down with dream hampton, the producer of “Surviving R. Kelly,” to discuss the star’s abuses. \n\n+++podcast\n\n[#iframe: https://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/thenewyorker/?share=1#file=/audio/json/909829/](100%x120)\n\n+++\n\n*This interview has been edited and condensed.*\n\n__I just want to start with a basic question, which is “Who is R. Kelly?”__\n\nHe is both a beloved songwriter and singer, who—I’m from Detroit, and he is someone who made music for black people in the Midwest, who do this thing called stepping, who have loved R. & B., even as hip-hop came and went. Maybe hip-hop is still here, I don’t know. But he is also a man who has had an open secret. We’ve known who this man is for a very long time, in terms of him being a predator.\n\n__You and I are in the same age range. You were one of the first people in our generation who was really carving a niche as a music journalist. One of the notable things about it has been your writing on, specifically, these questions of misogyny and sexism and the way that patriarchy has operated in popular culture. I wondered, what were you thinking about when Lifetime approached you?__\n\nI like cooking shows and home network. I don’t watch Bunim/Murray [programs], and I thought they were going to do some silly reënactment thing. When they told me they were interested in a more serious approach, something they’d never done before, I thought it was a time I could redeem myself for a profile I had done of R. Kelly in *Vibe* magazine, in 2000, where I just kind of wrote about his process. This was post his marriage to Aaliyah, but pre Jim DeRogatis writing about all of his predatory behavior and the lawsuits about him. I felt so whack about how that happened—my article coming out in November and then Jim’s reporting coming out in December—that I never wrote another magazine profile on an artist again.\n\n__Just to take a step back about this, when you say Aaliyah—Aaliyah was a fifteen-year-old rising R. & B. artist under the tutelage of R. Kelly at the time. Of course, notably, it came out—*Vibe* magazine published the documents around it—that R. Kelly had married her at age fifteen, when he was, at that time, in his late twenties.__\n\nI think a lot of this explaining you’re having to do for your audience is another part of the reason I did it. R. Kelly is uniquely our problem. And by “our problem,” I mean black folks. He didn’t really cross over. He had a crossover hit. Even the songs that he wrote for other people, like Maxwell or Michael Jackson, and arguably even Celine Dion, were R. & B. hits. \n\n__Going back ten years ago, I was involved in an effort that had what I thought was a modest objective, in my naïveté, which is that we were requesting that radio stations not play his music during the trial. I thought that his music being played on the radio sent a very contrary message to young women who were dealing with issues of sexual violence and assault. A group of us said that, just for the time of this trial, his music shouldn’t be on the radio. And the blowback that we got was so extreme—I look at it now as almost a kind of awakening experience. One of the things you saw with him were groups of people outside the courthouse. You include some of that in the documentary, the footage of that. But groups of people, very many of them women, very many of them young women, and they were there in support of him. It was very difficult to hear anything to the contrary. Despite these allegations, there was very much a kind of closing of ranks around him.__\n\nI wasn’t following the trial as closely in ’08, so, when I did a deep dive for this docuseries, Jerhonda Pace, one of his more vocal victims, a person who broke her N.D.A.—a young woman still, she’s not 26 yet—met him as one of those eleventh-grade supporters. So, he was at his trial, on trial for having sex with an underage girl, and he was cruising eleventh-graders on that trial. The hubris!\n\n__Really heinous allegations come up in the documentary: physical abuse, sexual abuse, starvation, people being isolated, kept from their families, and so on. What was the hardest thing for you to film?__\n\nSitting with each survivor was a marathon experience. It was hours on top of hours in a studio, just facing them. There was not one of those stories that was not hard. The stuff that, as a filmmaker, I was most proud of—in Episode 5, I fought for every frame—and that was the rescue of Dominique [Gardner] by her mother, Michelle Kramer. We’d flown Michelle in to do what all the other principals had done, which was to sit in front of this green screen and talk to me, face to face, for four or five hours. And Michelle said, “I don’t want to come to the studio.” She said, “I want to look for my child.” Legal told us we could not suggest this to her. We could only follow what she was going to do.\n\n__One of the things that people got, on the other side of it, was criticism that they thought that was a kind of tabloid spectacle. Was that a reason why Ms. Kramer didn’t call the authorities?__\n\nWell, try to call the authorities about a missing person older than eighteen. Then tell them that it’s an intergender, possibly romantic thing. Then tell them that that missing person is a black girl. She has called the police. They all have called the police. Maybe we didn’t do a good job of showing that again and again. They don’t get a response from the police. You’ll remember that the police were called on Michelle Kramer. They called the police on this mother. This idea that there’s some police squad waiting to drop out of the ceiling to rescue black girls is a fantasy, quite frankly, I didn’t know we were invested in until the last week on Twitter.\n\n__On this question about black girls and women: Do you think R. Kelly would be a free man if the young women making the allegations against him were white?__\n\nI don’t. But, then, I don’t find that question very useful. I think people prey on people they have access to. This is the reason why the question about the right—the extreme right, the Stormfront folks and the Breitbart folks—about black-on-black crime, even the invention of that phrase, is so wrong. You’ve written about this. Crime is committed in communities, and who you have access to. And we should say that R. Kelly was a victim of crime in the most intimate spaces, his own home. He was raped repeatedly as a child.\n\n__Does that complicate this equation? Is there some other conversation we should be having about people who are themselves survivors of sexual abuse, and the boomerang effect that could have in someone’s later life?__\n\nI would never try to speak as an expert about sexual violence and abuse. What I have been told by people who are experts is that, yes, almost one hundred per cent of abusers have been abused. But not one hundred per cent of people who have been abused go on to become abusers. At all. R. Kelly just turned fifty-two. And what I wish had happened back when R. Kelly was twenty-seven and had had this illegal marriage, which was quickly annulled, to Aaliyah, was that his team—people around him, his record label, anyone, his family—would have done a deep intervention.\n\n__Do you think that the fact R. Kelly was so cloistered within black communities explained any of the lag around taking these allegations more seriously?__\n\nWe filmed a protest in Detroit of the Mute R. Kelly concert. You see me outside of the concert, asking people do they feel any reticence to walk into this arena and give their money to this man, who, for at least twenty-five years, has been accused of abusing black girls, and they have the art-versus-artist answer for me. And/or that he’s not guilty. There’s this love that he has from black folks that is both a currency and a protection. And there’s this very convenient way that we’ve talked about him being found not guilty, as if he’s innocent.\n\n__Say more about that.__\n\nWe know that black men are often targeted unjustly. In fact, it’s a deep shame that black women have, handing over black men to this system that we know to be both unjust and that targets them. At the same time, black women are black people, and we, too, are targeted and treated unjustly in this system. In fact, most sexual-violence survivors don’t find justice in this system, regardless of race.\n\n__So what do you think should happen with R. Kelly?__\n\nI want justice for these women. And I would like them to define that—what restitution looks like for them. They’re never going to get back what they lost in these very critical years, these formative years in their lives. So I believe that, if the criminal-justice system can find him guilty, then so be it. I also believe in social death. I believe in boycott and divestment and sanctions. It’s been a practice of mine since I became political around South Africa, as a twelve-year-old. I believe in that practice, and I think he’s someone we should have turned away a long time ago.\n\n__Is there any plan for a follow-up to this documentary?__\n\nAbsolutely not. I can’t imagine&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;This was one of the darkest years of my life, working on this. And I say that with all respect to the survivors who’ve lived with this for a lot longer than me.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e2b2bfcc72cd92d06f4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"R.

My mother sat at our dining-room table, speaking in tones of seriousness with a friend, whom I’ll call Dianne, and a woman I didn’t recognize. I’d known Dianne as a gregarious presence in our household, whose laughter matched the impressive decibel level of my mother’s, but that day her demeanor was almost grave. My mother waved me upstairs, but not before Dianne turned in my direction. Her left eye was a piercing shade of purple, and swollen shut. She had been crying, and my mother and the other woman were ministering to her wounds, physical and emotional. I eavesdropped long enough to learn that Dianne’s husband had struck her, and not for the first time, and so I understood in some crude way that the scene around the table had not been improvised, that such incidents were common enough in the lives of women to warrant their own protocols.\n\nA few days later, my mother told me more about what had happened, how badly Dianne had been hurt, and about her concerns that one day Dianne might die as a result of her husband’s abuse. My mother’s motive for this disclosure had less to do with satisfying my preadolescent nosiness than with offering me a lesson in the consequences of male brutality. It was an implicit instruction in how I was *not* to behave as a man. The effect of that scene and the subsequent discussion of it was such that, four decades later, I can still recall with clarity both Dianne and the image of her distorted eye, but I remember nothing at all of her husband, not even his name, although he had visited us many times. The nameless, faceless assailant in Dianne’s home benefitted from the rules that I absorbed from the people who raised me, all of them black, all of them migrants from the South, and most of them resolute in their belief that police were to be summoned only as a last resort and, even then, were not to be trusted. A legacy of arbitrary violence at the hands of the police and a distrust of the system that allowed them to dispense it meant that Dianne found herself in a moral dilemma. She may have shared my mother’s fear that her husband might kill her, but, if so, she may have weighed that fear against another: that her husband would not be protected from the men charged with protecting her. The violence in her household was a private matter; invoking the police was, in this perspective, seen to be siding with an element considered inimical to her community. The void between fear and distrust turns routine calculations into complex equations. It also rebounds solely to the benefit of abusers.  \n\nThose complexities came back to mind last weekend, when Lifetime aired the documentary series “[Surviving R. Kelly](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/surviving-r-kelly-reframes-r-kelly-and-the-songs-we-once-loved).” Consisting of six episodes broadcast over three evenings, the program examines the layers of complicity, manipulation, deceit, and cowardice that surround Kelly and the twenty-year trail of sexual-misconduct accusations against him. Former associates detail his alleged obsessive, controlling habits; his marriage to the late R. & B. singer Aaliyah, when she was fifteen and he was twenty-seven; and a cult-like situation in Atlanta, involving women whose families say they have been unable to contact them, in some cases for years. (Kelly has settled several sexual-misconduct lawsuits and has consistently denied all accusations of wrongdoing.) The series, which was produced by the filmmaker and journalist dream hampton, might be called an exposé, but that term doesn’t accurately convey what “Surviving R. Kelly” is. Much of the subject matter covered has been reported elsewhere, beginning with a Chicago *Sun-Times* story, from December, 2000, in which Jim DeRogatis and Abdon Pallasch wrote about [allegations](https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/sun-times-archive-r-kelly-accused-of-sex-with-teenage-girls/,) of Kelly’s sexual misconduct with underage girls. The next year, DeRogatis received a copy of a tape purportedly showing the singer having sex with and urinating on an adolescent girl, which the *Sun-Times* sent to the Chicago police. We need a term for a film that relays information that is widely known but scarcely acknowledged. An exposé typically indicts the character of its subject; “Surviving R. Kelly” indicts a public that knew of his character and did nothing about it, a public that constructed an elaborate architecture of denial and has chosen to live in it. The silence around him has been remarkable, but its consequences are as visible as an eye swollen and bruised purple.\n\nI’m a witness to this phenomenon. As a result of the  tapes, a Chicago grand jury indicted Kelly on twenty-one counts of child pornography, to which he pleaded not guilty; the trial finally began in 2008\\. I was then teaching at Spelman College, in Atlanta, where I helped organize a campaign with what seemed a modest goal: a blackout of Kelly’s music for the duration of the court proceedings. The near-ubiquity of his music on black radio seemed to undercut the seriousness of the charges he faced. Yet the trial inspired the opposite of a backlash: fans lined up outside the courthouse to show their support. ([A woman who appears in the documentary](https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7966117/r-kelly-sex-cult-jerhonda-pace-the-real-interview) and discusses Kelly’s abusive behavior first met him there. She was fifteen at the time.) Copies of the video were sold on street corners around the country. The public, or at least that portion of it whose dollars subsidized Kelly’s stratospheric career, categorized it not as potential evidence of a depraved violation of a minor but as just another celebrity sex tape. I saw it in an Atlanta record store, alongside that week’s new music releases. Our campaign not only failed, it generated a cascade of ridicule from both men and women who invoked all the usual clichés of rationalization: the girl in the video was “fast,” or the incident was really the fault of her parents. “You could tell that wasn’t her first time,” a man in a barbershop said to me. “So what you’re saying is that she’d been molested before,” I shot back at him. The trial lasted a month, and Kelly was acquitted on all charges.\n\nThe reverberations of [#MeToo](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/me-too) have exposed a fundamental confusion about the difference between victims and victimizers. Almost as soon as abuses become known, a parallel conversation begins about the best way to rehabilitate and restore the abusers. Kelly existed in a strange, liminal space—there was no dialogue about his rehabilitation because he had yet to face any serious consequences for his alleged actions. This has everything to do with the ways that race refracts reality in this country. \n\nThe sheer number of charges of misogyny and abuse have tended to merge into a single blur of predation. But there are important distinctions that have dictated how the abuses were perceived, the contexts in which they occurred, and, crucially, how they were processed by the public once they became known. There’s a gulf between the accusations directed at [Harvey Weinstein](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/harvey-weinstein), [Matt Lauer](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/matt-lauers-firing-and-nbcs-theatre-of-accountability), and [Les Moonves](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/08/06/les-moonves-and-cbs-face-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct)—wealthy white men whose alleged excesses were understood as a perquisite of their status—and those directed at [Bill Cosby](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/bill-cosby) and R. Kelly, black men for whom success represented some broader communal hope that long odds in life could be surmounted. Cosby and Kelly know this, which is part of the reason that they were so effective at [manipulating public sentiment](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-feigned-victimhood-of-bill-cosby-brett-kavanaugh-and-clarence-thomas) around their various accusations. From the initial reports of sexual assault levelled against Cosby, in 2005, through to his conviction and incarceration last year, a not-insignificant number of black voices on social media and elsewhere attributed his troubles to a conspiracy to bring down a wealthy black man. It’s no coincidence that representatives for both [Cosby](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/bill-cosby-americas-dad-convicted-of-drugging-sex-assault/2018/04/27/b898fd58-49d4-11e8-8082-105a446d19b8_story.html?utm_term=.5bb0ad68b74c) and [Kelly](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/01/r-kelly-times-up-muterkelly)—as well as [Clarence Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZURHD5BU1o8), during his Supreme Court [confirmation hearings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egTyaIAaqz8)—referred to lynchings in denying allegations of sexual misconduct. It is a deflection that is as brilliant as it is craven. Lynchings were so commonly accompanied by specious charges of sexual assault that the journalist Ida B. Wells [took pains to dispel such claims](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14977/14977-h/14977-h.htm) in her writing. What many understand as a historical atrocity Kelly seems to have understood as the most efficient route to reasonable doubt.\n\nIn 2017, Jim DeRogatis reported on [the cult-like allegations against Kelly](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jimderogatis/parents-told-police-r-kelly-is-keeping-women-in-a-cult#.vt1ae27Y3E), for BuzzFeed. (Kelly has said that the women are there of their own free will.) An Atlanta-based arts administrator named Oronike Odeleye and the social-justice activist Kenyette Barnes then began a campaign called #MuteRKelly, which coördinated protests at Kelly’s concerts and succeeded in having his music removed from Spotify’s curated playlists. Last year, at the Grammys, when [Janelle Monáe](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-otherworldly-concept-albums-of-janelle-monae) gave a speech about [the Time’s Up initiative](https://www.billboard.com/video/janelle-monae-speech-about-2018-grammys-billboard-on-billboardne-sourceflv-8096771), Kelly’s name was an unspoken one in many people’s minds. A generation of black feminists who came to prominence in the nineteen-seventies and eighties—Toni Morrison, Toni Cade Bambara, and Michelle Wallace among them—devoted their work to disentangling the complex of victims who nonetheless victimize, a riddle that remains prevalent enough to complicate things that should be starkly simple. #MeToo has helped to change the public perspective on these matters. But the success of “Surviving R. Kelly” to provoke a reëvaluation of the artist relies in large part on the fact that it was produced by a black female filmmaker who has also had a career as a feminist music journalist. The forces arrayed against Kelly are not institutions whose hands are tainted by history but people who are as familiar with that history as he is, and are unimpressed by his efforts to fashion it into an alibi. The conversation now is akin to the one my mother had with me nearly four decades ago: this is what the aftermath of brutality looks like. Be a witness to it.\n\nSince the airing of the series, the Fulton County District Attorney is reportedly launching an investigation in Georgia and, in Chicago, the Cook County state’s attorney, Kim Foxx, has called on any women who may have been victimized by Kelly to come forward. There is likely to be some broader reckoning in the future. Last year, less than a week before Kelly’s team declared him the subject of a lynching crusade, [the National Memorial for Peace and Justice](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/a-visit-to-montgomerys-legacy-museum) opened in Montgomery, Alabama. It is a monument to the thousands of black lives lost as a consequence of recreational murder in the United States. Its central feature is a series of markers bearing the names of every identifiable victim of lynching. The name Robert Sylvester Kelly appears nowhere among them.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e2b2bfcc72cd92d06f4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"R.

Nobody else could muster much surprise: after a three-month trial in which prosecutors unleashed a tsunami of evidence against him, there was never any doubt that he would be convicted and, after his sentencing this summer, shipped off to a supermax prison. But during the trial, which I dropped in on periodically over the past few months, Guzmán had often seemed strangely detached from the gravity of the justice that he was facing. He grinned and waved and blew kisses to family members and supporters in the spectators’ gallery, and he often wore a look of benign surprise, with the raised eyebrows and fixed smile of a cartoon character. In the fluorescent light of the courtroom, El Chapo looked like a harmless geezer, a guy who should be playing shuffleboard. He looked, a friend of mine remarked, like an old man lost in a grocery store. \n\nYet, as one former adjutant after another took the stand, the jury was treated to a detailed anatomy of the drug cartel that El Chapo operated—and the terror that he exerted. This “Wizard of Oz” contrast between the bloodthirsty narco-oligarch who stood accused of running what is probably the most successful drug cartel in history and the little dude who sat at the defense table, dwarfed by his own lawyers, was jarring. But, then, that has always been the rub with El Chapo, the distinction between the figure of folklore and the brutal, banal, and very real evil of the man himself. The prosecution called fifty-six witnesses and the defense just one. To the degree that El Chapo’s defense team had any case at all, it was that the prosecution was ascribing an outsized power to Guzmán that he did not in fact possess. The defense argued, persuasively, that El Chapo was never the sole leader of the Sinaloa cartel, that other figures—chief among them Ismael Zambada García, who is known as El Mayo and is still at large—held great sway. They also pointed out, persuasively, that the corrupt Mexican state itself bore a great deal of culpability for the tons of drugs that the Sinaloa cartel shipped into the United States and the impunity with which the cartel operated. All of this was true. The problem for El Chapo was that it was also beside the point: the caricature of a mythical icon of the Mexican drug trade may have been reductive, but that doesn’t change the baseline truth of the specific allegations against him. \n\nI first wrote about Guzmán in 2012, at a time when, on this side of the border, he was less of a household name. In that piece, which was a sort of [business-school case study](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/magazine/how-a-mexican-drug-cartel-makes-its-billions.html) of the Sinaloa cartel, I wrestled with this challenge of untangling the myth and the man. In 2014, after Guzmán was captured by Mexican authorities (with a decisive assist from their American counterparts), I wrote a [piece for this magazine](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/05/the-hunt-for-el-chapo) about the effort to track him down. The tonal challenge persisted: How do you capture the telenovela outlandishness of this story without glossing over the rampant ugliness or minimizing the appalling cost? I emphasized that Guzmán was responsible for thousands of murders. This conundrum took on a surreal dimension for me when, after that piece ran in the magazine, I was approached by an attorney for the Guzmán family who inquired about whether I might be interested in ghostwriting the kingpin’s memoir. ([I passed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-tragic-farce-of-el-chapo).) \n\nIn the aftermath of his conviction, it is worth dwelling on what we talk about when we talk about El Chapo. In a press conference following the verdict, one of the prosecutors heralded the conviction as a victory in the war on drugs. That seems like the wrong frame; taking El Chapo out of the game will not make the slightest dent in the flow of drugs across the border. Some craven observers, like Ted Cruz, have tried to use El Chapo’s case as an argument for a border wall, though anyone who followed the trial would recognize it as a tutorial in the pointlessness of such a measure. Take it from the federal agents and former high-ranking Sinaloa smugglers who testified: most illegal drugs coming into the United States from Mexico do so through official ports of entry. \n\nBut there is a deeper sense in which the rhetoric we use when we talk about the border and the war on drugs is misguided and always has been. The real engine for the cross-border trade in marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and fentanyl is not the clever salesmanship of Mexican crooks—it’s the rampant demand of American addicts and recreational users. This is a point that seldom impinges on our national dialogue about the border with Mexico: the drug trade is *dynamic*. What makes it unstoppable is not weak border protections or wily Mexicans but the insatiable American appetite for drugs. Where there is money and demand, trade will flourish, borders be damned. Years ago, I interviewed a former D.E.A. official who told me about a high-tech fence that was put up along the border in Arizona. “They erect this fence,” he said, “only to go out there a few days later and discover that these guys have a *catapult*, and they’re flinging hundred-pound bales of marijuana over to the other side.” \n\nUnder, over, through: as long as there is an American demand for drugs, drugs will find their way into America. \n\nAnd, from a Mexican perspective, part of what is so galling about this debate is that the drug war there, which has claimed a hundred thousand or more lives in recent decades, is *fuelled* by that demand. Drugs move north across the border to be sold, and then money—American money—moves south, across the same border, to pay the cartels. We sneer at corruption and state failure in Mexico, at the ease with which El Chapo and his associates could buy off officials at every level of government. But missing in this analysis is the fact that it is American money—*our* money—that underwrites those bribes. And all those deaths in Mexico—it’s telling that we don’t even know the aggregate number, which makes it easier to forget that each individual murder marks a specific, heartrending tragedy for some family somewhere—are attributable in part to the murderousness of the cartels and the weakness and corruption of the Mexican state, of course, but also to the guns which are routinely smuggled from our country, where it’s laughably easy to buy guns, into Mexico, where it’s harder to do so. We look at those deaths as if they were so foreign, as if they were an act of nature. But if you know anything about cross-border commodities markets, licit or illicit, you must recognize that we can’t blame Mexicans for drug overdoses in our country and not acknowledge that we bear some corresponding responsibility for drug murders in theirs. \n\nIf I sound bottomlessly cynical about all of this, I suppose writing about the drug war will do that to you. But I don’t agree with one prevalent strain of commentary on the El Chapo trial, which is that the whole spectacle was just a charade put on by the authorities, the show trial of a designated fall guy rather than a landmark moment for criminal justice. Any trial can serve as theatre, and the El Chapo proceedings took this tendency to its logical extreme. But a big criminal trial also serves a more sober empirical function: in the methodical accumulation of carefully corroborated evidence, prosecutors create a detailed record of events that might otherwise have remained shrouded in a fog of intrigue. By placing the man in a room from which he could not escape and making him listen to witness after witness who described his greed and cruelty, the trial reconciled, once and for all, the myth of El Chapo with the little man himself. And in doing so, it dismantled the most enduring and pernicious element of that myth, which was the notion of impunity—the idea that systems fail, anyone can be bought, crime pays, and the villain gets away with it in the end. The conviction of El Chapo won’t end the drug war, or even the Sinaloa cartel. Far from it. But, by bringing an infamously uncatchable mass murderer to justice and making him answer, finally, for his many crimes, the verdict represents an important symbolic victory for our beleaguered notions of the rule of law.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e2c64aef5062c9d94ad3a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e2c64aef5062c9d94ad3a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Joaquín

proceedings last week, evidence was presented which you may find helpful if you’re still trying to assess [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)’s rationale for his border wall. Along with bigness and elemental beauty, he credits it with crime-stopping powers: in particular, he says, it will stanch the flow of drugs that feed our country’s raging opioid habit. In his prime-time address to the nation, on January 8th, Trump told Americans that “our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.” Without a wall, he tweeted on January 11th, “Criminals, Gangs, Human Traffickers, Drugs & so much other big trouble can easily pour in. It can be stopped cold!” \n\nOne of the proceedings was the case that the Massachusetts attorney general filed against Purdue Pharma, the company that produced the powerful opioid painkiller OxyContin, along with some of the company’s directors and eight members of the [Sackler family](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain), which owns it. For years, the Sacklers, an art-loving, philanthropic clan, have represented themselves as hands-off proprietors, who were unaware of both the dangers of OxyContin and Purdue’s aggressive marketing of it. (In 2007, Purdue and three current and former top executives, none of them Sacklers, pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges of misleading the public about the addiction risks of OxyContin, and paid $634.5 million in fines.) But a court filing released last week disclosed the exulting of one family member, Richard Sackler, that OxyContin would create “a blizzard of prescriptions,” which he predicted would be “dense, deep and white.” It also contained his recommendation, in an e-mail, “to hammer on abusers in every way possible”—on people, in other words, who had become dependent on a drug that was extremely addictive, and, thanks in large part to Purdue’s assurances that it was not, was wildly overprescribed. The case was a reminder than an opioid epidemic that is largely responsible for lowering life expectancy in the United States for the first time since 1980 began quite legally, with a drug manufactured not by a Mexican cartel but by an American pharmaceutical company.\n\nThe second proceeding was the trial of Joaquín ([El Chapo](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/21/kate-del-castillo-sean-penn-and-el-chapo)\\) Guzmán Loera, the suspected leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel, which has been under way in New York since early November. This week, a former high-ranking associate of Guzmán’s, named Jesús Zambada García, was testifying about the cartel’s business practices. Asked how it typically smuggled drugs into the United States, Garcia explained that Mexican drug traffickers rely mainly on vehicles driven through official border checkpoints. They used illicit tunnels under the border in the early nineteen-nineties, he explained, but, after the tunnels were detected and closed, they turned to hiding narcotics in legitimate-looking shipments of canned goods and the like. Sometimes they transported them by sea, smuggling drugs in fishing boats or dispatching them in submersibles. One stratagem they did not apparently resort to was sneaking across the Mexican border *between* checkpoints—the gaps that a wall would fill. \n\nThis testimony comported with what Daniel Ciccarone, a researcher who heads the [Heroin in Transition project](https://globalprojects.ucsf.edu/project/heroin-transition) at the University of California, San Francisco, had told me. If you’re going to put money into drug interdiction—an endless task, he said, given how nimble and persistent the cartels are in responding to demand—“Where are you going to get the most bang for your buck? Is it going to be stopping a person hiking through the desert to get to Texas? Or is it going to be stopping trucks?” He answered his own question: “The tonnage is coming in through trucks and cars that go through border checkpoints—so put the money there.” (The compromise bill on border security that the Democratic-led House passed on January 3rd does just that, allotting additional funds to “non-intrusive inspection devices” at ports of entry.)\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Agency’s [2018 National Drug Threat Assessment](https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/DIR-032-18%202018%20NDTA%20final%20low%20resolution.pdf) underlines the point: the majority of the heroin that gets across the southwest border, which is indeed where most heroin enters the United States, comes in privately owned cars, trucks, and tractor-trailers “entering the United States at legal ports of entry.” (Cocaine predominantly arrives in vehicles at official points of entry as well, according to the D.E.A, though commercial air travel is another route.) \n\nThe opioid epidemic appeared in three waves, starting in the nineteen-nineties: the first was of prescription pills, mainly OxyContin; the second was of heroin, which replaced pills for some opioid-addicted people, once new prescribing practices and less abusable formulations rendered pills less available; and the most recent took the form of fentanyl and other synthetics, which are cheaper to produce than heroin and fifty times more potent. Ciccarone and his U.C.S.F. colleague Sarah Mars have conducted research showing that the fentanyl wave is a product more of supply than of demand. Most users don’t particularly want fentanyl—they know the risks of overdosing on a much stronger drug—but it’s what’s available now. And it is often branded and sold in powder form as heroin, or formed into counterfeit pills, making it difficult for users and even street-level sellers to know what they’ve got.\n\nFentanyl is used for medical purposes, such as pain relief in cancer and epidurals in childbirth, and is manufactured above-board in this country, where it is a classified as a controlled substance. But illicit fentanyl, which is now at the leading edge of overdose deaths in the United States, has a much more complicated provenance. According to the D.E.A., most of it is made in clandestine laboratories in China. Though some is then smuggled in across the southwest border, much of it is mailed or shipped. Last June, at the port of Philadelphia, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents seized a hundred and ten pounds of fentanyl that was concealed in a shipment of iron oxide from China. (Alerted by a narcotic-sniffing dog, the agents tested the substance with a handheld isotype-analysis tool.) Paul Knierim, the D.E.A.’s deputy chief of operations for the office of global enforcement, testified last September, at a congressional subcommittee hearing titled “[Tackling Fentanyl: The China Connection](https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2018-09/DEA%20Testimony%20-%20China%20and%20Fentanyl%20HFAC_0.pdf),” that “China is one of the world’s top producers of the precursor chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine and fentanyl.” When the D.E.A. takes action to ban the import of certain chemicals, “Clandestine chemists can easily continue developing and synthesizing new synthetic opioids that do not appear on any schedule of controlled substances,” Knierim said, sometimes in a matter of weeks. “Sadly, these substances are often first discovered when D.E.A. receives reports from local hospitals and coroners in connection with a spate of overdoses.” He added that, because of its potency, “one kilogram of fentanyl purchased in China” carries the potential of “being lethal for five hundred thousand people.”\n\nThe fact that only small amounts of fentanyl are needed to supply a very large population makes detecting and disrupting imports that much harder, Mars told me. This is even more the case with fentanyl substitutes such as carfentanil, a synthetic opioid that is a hundred times more powerful (it’s used as a tranquilizer for elephants and horses) that has begun to turn up in the U.S. heroin supply over the past few years.\n\nFentanyl is also increasingly sold on the dark Web, using cryptocurrency. In August, a joint investigation by the D.E.A., the Department of Justice, the F.B.I., *ICE*{:.small}, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, called Operation Darkness Falls, led to the arrest of a San Antonio couple, Matthew and Holly Roberts, who allegedly ran dark-Web marketplaces for fentanyl and other drugs. The San Antonio *Express-News* [described them](https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/An-ordinary-couple-who-drove-raggedy-cars-13197479.php) as “an ordinary couple” who taught themselves how to conduct their drug trafficking online, disguising it behind a mail-order business for glow bracelets. (They later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and other crimes.)\n\nIn some ways, the Robertses’ D.I.Y. entrepreneurship and alertness to market trends are very much of our time. The conditions of modern capitalism (from the free and constant flow of goods across borders to the advent of Bitcoin) and the iron law of prohibition (once a drug is banned, another one or another means of procuring it will fill the void) are very good for drug trafficking. Smart interdiction of drugs can make a difference, but you have to be thinking about what will replace the drug whose supply you are cutting off, and whether it might be worse. And, in any case, a wall isn’t smart interdiction.\n\nIn the end, it’s an old story: you can’t really stop drugs unless you stop people from using drugs. In the case of the opioid epidemic, we need greater availability of, less squeamishness about, and more funding for medication-assisted treatments, such as buprenorphine, naltrexone, and methadone. And we need better mental-health care for people who are self-medicating their emotional pain with opioids. Ciccarone told me, “I meet police chiefs who have the right hearts and the right brains. They come in and say, ‘I need to address childhood trauma and other root causes if I want to address drugs and crime.’ They have a long view, and that’s what we need. We should be making a more resilient society—treating the pathos that the drugs are a response to. After twenty years of doing drugs research, I still believe that’s possible.” If only we had a President who agreed with him.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ea32396212cbb9fcb7a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Opioid Crisis","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"opioid-crisis"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a41c92e2c9b85da19","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Border Wall","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"border-wall"},{"id":"5c2e2c64aef5062c9d94ad3a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Joaquín Guzmán Loera (El Chapo)","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"joaquin-guzman-loera-el-chapo"},{"id":"5c2e1ca7397f5b30646d0628","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Purdue Pharma","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"purdue-pharma"},{"id":"5c2e1dcfb75f002c8941e5d9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration Law","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration-law"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a033f2179605b11ad996f","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Margaret Talbot joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2003.\nPreviously, she was a contributing writer at the New York *Times\nMagazine* and, from 1995 to 1999, an editor at *The New Republic.* Her\nstories, covering legal issues, social policy, and popular culture, have\nappeared, in addition to in the *Times Magazine* and *The New\nRepublic,* in *The Atlantic Monthly, National Geographic,* and\nthe *Times Book Review*.

She had just returned home, to Los Angeles, after a Caribbean cruise with her sister and her parents. The previous year had been difficult: in November, her marriage to the actor and model Aarón Díaz had ended. Del Castillo had spent much of the year starring as a drug trafficker in “La Reina del Sur” (“The Queen of the South”), a sixty-three-episode telenovela on Telemundo. Her character, Teresa Mendoza, a small-town Mexican woman whose love life enticed her into the narcotics trade, was given to ruthlessly practical observations. “Life’s a business,” Teresa once said. “The only thing that changes is the merchandise.” The series had dominated ratings in the Spanish-speaking world, and made her a household name, particularly in Mexico, but for del Castillo, who is forty-three, the experience had been overwhelming; at one point during filming, she had received medical treatment for exhaustion.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow she thumbed through a few notebooks filled with song lyrics and observations, and then started typing in an app that allowed her to write longer tweets. “Today I want to express what I think, and if it suits anybody else, great,” she began, in Spanish. During the next half hour, she proceeded to free-associate on love and politics: “I don’t believe in marriage, I believe in love . . . I don’t believe in either punishment or sin . . . I don’t believe in the Pope and the Vatican and all their wealth . . . I am alive and for that I thank God every day, for who I am, for good or bad.”\n\n\n\nThen she turned to Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as El Chapo, or Shorty—the leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel. El Chapo had escaped from prison in 2001, and had been at large since then. He was widely understood to be the most powerful drug lord in Mexico, if not the world, and was considered responsible for the deaths of thousands of people. Yet many Mexicans saw him as a populist antihero rather than as a murderer, because of his humble origins, his defiance of a corrupt and ineffective federal government, and his reputation for benevolence to Sinaloa’s poor and downtrodden. Del Castillo wrote, “Today I believe more in El Chapo Guzmán than I do in the governments that hide truths from me, even if they are painful, who hide the cures for cancer, *AIDS*{: .small}, etc., for their own benefit. *MR. CHAPO, WOULDN’T IT BE COOL IF YOU STARTED TRAFFICKING WITH THE GOOD?*{: .small} . . . *COME ON SEñOR, YOU WOULD BE THE HERO OF HEROES. LET’S TRAFFIC WITH LOVE, YOU KNOW HOW*{: .small}.” She signed off, “I love you all, Kate,” pressed Send, brushed her teeth, and went to bed.\n\n\n\nShortly afterward, Del Castillo went to Tijuana, where a friend was undergoing breast-implant surgery. In the hospital, the popular talk show “Tercer Grado” was playing on TV, and del Castillo and her friend watched as the guests took turns denouncing her tweet. Carlos Marín, the editorial director of the publishing company Grupo Milenio, was particularly savage. “This actress wrote a truly stupid thing on Twitter,” he said, “and she displays an abysmal ignorance about the problem of cancer, the problem of *AIDS*{: .small}.” He added that this “beautiful, lovely, great actress” was “encouraging the commission of crime.”\n\n\n\nFor weeks, the Mexican public obsessed over del Castillo’s tweet, debating whether she was an apologist for the cruelty and bloodshed committed in El Chapo’s name. Her father, Eric del Castillo, who is also a well-known actor, defended her to the media but then e-mailed her a line-by-line critique of her manifesto. Her older sister, the journalist Verónica del Castillo, says that she angrily reminded Kate, “You are not Teresa Mendoza.”\n\n\n\nLast month, I met del Castillo at her house in a gated community in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. She was sitting on a sunny terrace beside an infinity pool and an array of saguaro cacti. She poured two glasses of a _reposado_ tequila called Honor, a brand she is a part owner of. She wore tight jeans, a blouse, and very high heels, and had a small gold earring in her right lobe that read “Fuck.” “I was so upset,” she said, of the reaction to her tweet. “You know, why are they crushing me? I’m not saying all of this is true. This is just what I believe!”\n\n\n\nFour years after the fact, del Castillo still seemed bewildered. Her mother, who is also named Kate, told me, “Everything she does is that way—without thinking about the consequences.” The consequence that del Castillo had least anticipated was that the man she had addressed in her tweet might actually respond.\n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b65c05d2f45736c34cf56]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAs del Castillo tells the story, in the late summer of 2014 she received an e-mail from one of El Chapo’s associates. Through the Mexican actors’ guild, he had found her parents’ telephone number in Mexico City and told her mother that he was a movie producer who wished to speak to Kate about a project. The first messages he sent del Castillo were vague. Only when she replied that she was too busy for such inquiries did the man state his business: _Soy licenciado de Señor Joaquín Guzmán Loera_. (“I am Señor Joaquín Guzmán Loera’s lawyer.”) He told her that the drug lord, who had been re-arrested that February, was interested in making a movie about his life. He asked if she would come to Mexico City to discuss the prospect. (Del Castillo says that her computer has not saved these e-mails, and that she is relying on her memory of the exchange.) “I immediately said yes,” she told me.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lawyer, Andrés Granados Flores, had approached del Castillo at a propitious moment. She was in Miami, filming another “narco-series” for Telemundo. Despite the success of “La Reina del Sur,” most people in the U.S. had never heard of her. She had moved to L.A. in 2001, to break into the American movie industry. Patricia Riggen, who cast del Castillo as an undocumented immigrant in her 2007 film, “Under the Same Moon,” told me, “She went from a place where everyone knew her to a place where no one did.” She added, “I think it took a lot of courage.”\n\n\n\nFor her first U.S. role, in the 2002 PBS series “American Family,” del Castillo says that she was made to dye her brunet hair black, so that she would appear more Latina. She was turned down for other roles, because her accent was too pronounced. In an effort to burnish her acting credentials, she sought out edgy roles, playing a transgender prison inmate in “K-11” and a Bolivian prostitute in “American Visa.” She also appeared in the Showtime series “Weeds,” playing a nefarious Mexican politician who is killed when she gets whacked with a croquet mallet. But such opportunities were rare. She said, “I’d go to auditions, and all the time it’s ‘You’re too Latina,’ or ‘You’re not Latina enough.’ ” Meanwhile, she continued to act in telenovelas like the one she was filming in Miami, in which she again played a wily and glamorous drug trafficker.\n\n\n\nOn September 29th, del Castillo took a private plane from Miami to an airstrip near Mexico City. Before boarding, she photographed the plane’s tail number and sent it to a friend with instructions to trace the plane if she did not hear from del Castillo that evening. As she emerged from immigration, two men in suits smiled in recognition. One was Granados, who had a youthful appearance, with a wide face and close-cropped hair. Accompanying him was another lawyer, named Óscar Manuel Gómez Núñez, who was short and chubby, with a mustache. El Chapo, they said, had instructed them to take her to dinner at one of the nicest restaurants in Mexico City. Fearing possible encounters with the paparazzi, del Castillo suggested that they go to a nearby taquería instead.\n\n\n\n“_Señorita_, if he knows we’ve taken you to get tacos, he’ll kill us,” she recalls one of them saying. When she blanched, they laughed and assured her that they were joking. They settled on a restaurant by the highway, where they ate at a secluded table. The attorneys told del Castillo that, while El Chapo had received numerous offers from Hollywood producers, he trusted del Castillo and wanted to give her the rights to his life story.\n\n\n\n“I was, like, ‘You are kidding me,’ ” del Castillo told me. “ ‘O.K., hold on. First of all, is he interested in a movie, a book, a documentary, a series?’ They said, ‘Anything you want. He’s giving you the rights.’ ” After a minute, del Castillo asked the inevitable question: “Why me?”\n\n\n\nAccording to del Castillo, the lawyers replied, “Because you’re very brave. Because you’re outspoken. Because you always tell the truth, even when it’s about the government. Because you come from a great family. And because he’s a fan of yours from ‘La Reina del Sur.’ ”\n\n\n\nDel Castillo and the lawyers talked for two hours. After lunch, one of them told her, “You know what—we first tried to contact you right after you wrote on Twitter. He wanted to send you flowers.” But they were unable to find her address.\n\n\n\nIn the next several months, del Castillo wrapped shooting for the Telemundo series and then, in early 2015, began rehearsals for “The 33,” a film directed by Patricia Riggen and based on the Chilean miners who were buried underground for two months, in 2010. (Del Castillo played the wife of the main character, portrayed by Antonio Banderas.) All the while, del Castillo imagined visiting El Chapo and conducting a series of interviews to develop the film project. “I was still deciding between a documentary or a movie,” she says, though his preference was clear: “He wanted a big movie, and he wanted me to star in it.” It was not clear to her what strong female roles existed in the life of El Chapo.\n\n\n\nShe mentioned her new project to almost no one. One exception was an Argentine producer named Fernando Sulichin, whom she had met in early 2012, at a reception hosted by the director and screenwriter Oliver Stone. Sulichin had told del Castillo that he was a fan of her work. Later, the two had lunch at the Polo Lounge, in Beverly Hills, where del Castillo recalls Sulichin telling her, “I read your tweet. Please, please—if you ever have contact with the guy, let me know.” \n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b65c2c195de33cba59158]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter she told Sulichin about her meeting in Mexico, he introduced her to another Argentine, José Ibáñez, who had produced the Oliver Stone documentary “South of the Border” with Sulichin. She conveyed their interest to El Chapo’s attorneys. In December, 2014, El Chapo sent del Castillo a handwritten letter:   \n\n\n> Thank you so much for what you did for me, because, _paisana_, you did me the favor of speaking for me. Thanks, _amiga_, I cannot pay you back for what you did for me. I’m letting you know that I’m O.K. . . . With respect to the rights, you and my lawyers should come to an agreement. With respect to the rights, I want it to be clear that you are the one that decides everything that is done, what you want and what you don’t want. \nThen El Chapo referred to “Visitantes,” a Mexican horror film in which del Castillo played a doctor driven mad by apparitions:   \n\n\n> On another subject, some friends told me that they went to the movies to see a horror film you were in, _amiga_. They told me it’s really cool. Hopefully they’ll play it soon on some TV channel. . . . I love your acting, you really go for it. I congratulate you. I imagine acting can’t be so easy, _amiga_. I hope to say hello to you in person someday. Hopefully soon. Say hello to your dad, and your whole family, for me. I watch your father very often, because they show movies where he’s the main character. O.K., _amiga_, my respects to you. You’re a love. Thanks so much. Your friend, Joaquín Guzmán. \n\n\nOn January 9, 2015, Guzmán signed over his story rights to Kate del Castillo, for a project to be co-produced by Sulichin and Ibáñez. A notary at the Altiplano prison witnessed his signature. Around the same time, he wrote her a second letter, in which he described his Christmas meal (turkey and Coca-Cola) and also his New Year’s Eve dinner (pork and Coca-Cola). He wrote, “I tell you, that series that you made, I saw it and I loved it. I’ve seen it many times—you’re a great actress in it. I’m referring to ‘La Reina del Sur.’ ”\n\n\n\nThat one of the world’s most cunning criminals would entrust his life story to an actress he had never met would seem fantastical even in a movie. But, del Castillo told me, “maybe he thought I could understand his world, in a way.” El Chapo’s apparent conflation of truth with fiction—Kate del Castillo as La Reina—suggests a flicker of innocence. “When you meet an actor, you think you know that person really well,” Patricia Riggen said. “So I’m sure El Chapo believed he knew Kate. It’s like John Gotti saying, ‘I’ll only give my role to Al Pacino. He’s the only one who would know how to play me right.’ ”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nOn July 11, 2015, del Castillo attended a prizefight in L.A. with the boxer and promoter Oscar de la Hoya. Afterward, as she was having a drink at a downtown bar, a friend called and told her that El Chapo had escaped from prison, using a tunnel that ran directly to his cell. The trafficker’s attorney, Granados, later texted her, “I’m celebrating!” She responded, “Me even more.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDel Castillo insists that she was shocked by the news—her exclusive story had just vanished. When she told Sulichin that their project was now worthless, he assured her that this was not the case. “It just got juicier,” she remembers him telling her.\n\n\n\nSulichin had been discussing El Chapo’s prison break with a friend of his, the actor and director Sean Penn. Penn was known for his interest in Latin-American politics—he had met the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro’s brother Raúl—and his denunciations of the war on drugs. Del Castillo and her two producers believed that their project stood a better chance of being picked up by a film studio if a major figure in American movies, like Penn, was attached to it. When Sulichin told Penn that he knew a Mexican actress who was in close contact with El Chapo, Penn requested a meeting with her.\n\n\n\nPenn, Sulichin, and del Castillo met for lunch at Fig, a restaurant in Santa Monica’s Fairmont Hotel. Because del Castillo had an appointment early that afternoon*—she was about to take the oath to become an American citizen—she cut their discussion short. Penn did not indicate any interest in del Castillo’s movie project. Instead, referring to El Chapo, he asked, “Do you think we can go and see him?”\n\n\n\nShe says that she replied, “That sounds really dangerous. The guy’s on the run, you know. But I can try.”\n\n\n\n“Ask him,” he said.\n\n\n\nThree days later, on September 25th, del Castillo flew to Guadalajara to attend a friend’s birthday. That evening, she met Granados and Gómez. They handed her a BlackBerry and told her that their boss would like to hear from her directly. In these text messages, which were later leaked to the Mexican press—not by del Castillo, almost certainly not by the drug trafficker, and therefore likely by someone inside the Mexican government—El Chapo said that she could come to the Sinaloa resort town of Mazatlán and spend a day with him at a nearby ranch. Then he wrote, “_Amiga_, if you’ll bring the wine, I’ll also drink yours. . . . I’m not a drinker, but your presence will be a lovely thing and I very much want to get to know you and become very good friends. You are the best in this world. . . . I will take care of you more than I do my own eyes.” \n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: /photos/590974ea2179605b11ad8198]|||\n\nSean Penn and del Castillo pose with El Chapo. *Photograph courtesy Kate del Castillo*{: .credit}\n\n|||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nDel Castillo replied, “It moves me so much that you say you’ll take care of me—nobody has ever taken care of me, thank you! And I’ll be free next weekend!”\n\n\n\nDel Castillo then left to join her friends, while the lawyers stayed on the BlackBerry to tell El Chapo that she was planning to bring along the two producers as well as Sean Penn, “one of the most famous actors in Hollywood.” El Chapo had never heard of Penn. Gómez then explained that “he made the film ‘21 Grams’ ” and was a “political activist” who had been a critic of the Bush Administration. El Chapo did not object.\n\n\n\nThe following day, the lawyers gave del Castillo a BlackBerry, so that she could contact El Chapo. They began texting again just after 11 *P.M.*{: .small} He told her that he would be glad to welcome her and her friends. She was effusive but also strategic: “Thanks to you I’ll get to meet you—you have no idea how emotional this makes me feel. Thanks for your confidence. I’ve been putting together an important team with people who are highly respected in Hollywood. I want you to hear them out.”\n\n\n\n“_Amiga_,” he replied, “have confidence that everything will be fine—otherwise I wouldn’t be inviting you. I’ll take care of you, you’ll see that when you come, I’ll get to drink your tequila with you. As I told you, I’m not a drinker, but with you I’ll drink to the feeling of being together. Thanks so much for being such a fine person. How beautiful you are, _amiga_, in every way.’’\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nDel Castillo flew back to Los Angeles the next day. On October 1st, Penn came over to her house in the late afternoon. He stayed for several hours, even joining a tasting of her tequila that del Castillo was holding. He gave her his passport information so that her assistant could book a charter flight to Guadalajara the following morning. (Del Castillo wired the fee for the plane—$33,720.37—from her bank account. Penn later reimbursed her for a portion of the sum, though their memories differ on the amount.) Penn was eager to hear every detail about how she had come to form a bond with the world’s most famous fugitive. Del Castillo interpreted these inquiries as coming from a potential partner in her film project.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, Penn was asking as a journalist, though he was not taking notes or recording the conversation. By this time, he had contacted Jann Wenner, the founder of _Rolling Stone_, and told him that he was about to take a clandestine trip to meet El Chapo. _Rolling Stone_ was struggling. In 2014, the magazine had published a story about a gang rape at the University of Virginia. After an investigation by the Columbia Journalism School determined that the article had not been sufficiently fact-checked, the magazine retracted it. Three lawsuits have been filed against _Rolling Stone_.\n\n\n\nWenner assigned Penn the story, and on October 2nd del Castillo, Penn, and the two producers, Sulichin and Ibáñez, boarded an eight-seater jet in Van Nuys. Del Castillo had put together a gift package for El Chapo. It included a novel she had written, called “Tuya” (a fictionalized account of her first marriage), a book of poetry by Jaime Sabines Gutiérrez (with her personal favorites underlined), a bottle of her tequila, and two movies on DVD: “Under the Same Moon,” in which she starred, and Penn’s “21 Grams.” Penn was carrying a letter of assignment from Wenner, saying that Penn, Sulichin, and Ibáñez would be the story’s authors. (Del Castillo says that she did not know about the letter.) On the plane, Penn read “ZeroZeroZero,” the Mafia narco-trafficking best-seller, by the Italian journalist Roberto Saviano.\n\n\n\nEl Chapo’s son, Alfredo Guzmán, met the group at a hotel in Guadalajara, where they left their luggage and their cell phones. At a nearby dirt airfield, they boarded two small planes. During the turbulent two-hour flight, Penn and del Castillo took turns drinking from her gift bottle of tequila to steady themselves. After they landed, in a marshy area, two S.U.V.s drove them seven hours through mountainous forest until they arrived, at about nine in the evening, at a spot near the city of Cosalá, in Sinaloa. Del Castillo saw a few run-down buildings that, it appeared, had been sparsely furnished for this meeting. El Chapo, who wore a clean long-sleeved shirt and jeans, was standing outside and embraced del Castillo immediately.\n\n\n\nThe group sat outside on metal chairs around a wooden table, while several other men hovered nearby. Del Castillo pulled out the tequila bottle, apologizing for its being half-empty, and introduced her companions to El Chapo, adding, “We still don’t know what we’re going to do—a documentary or a movie.”\n\n\n\n“Whatever you want, _amiga_,” El Chapo assured her, smiling broadly, as he did throughout the evening.\n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b65c3c195de33cba5915c]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nOver tacos and tequila, del Castillo and El Chapo exchanged small talk about her family and his life on the run. Then Penn asked her to translate on his behalf. He said that he was there to write a story for _Rolling Stone_, and that he would like to do a series of interviews with the drug trafficker. Del Castillo says that she was taken aback. Penn later said in a statement, “Kate was a valued partner in our journey, which was embarked upon with total transparency and full knowledge of our collective interests. From our first meeting, I discussed with her my intention to interview Joaquín Guzmán for an article in connection with the meeting that she facilitated. We discussed it again during the flight and the trip to Mexico with our partners.” Sulichin believes that the article was discussed on the flight to Guadalajara; Ibáñez believes that it was discussed at their hotel in Guadalajara.\n\n\n\nDel Castillo says that Penn’s claim that he told her about his idea for an article at their first meeting is “total and complete bullshit,” and that his mention of the story to El Chapo was the first she had heard of it. “This was not how I was expecting the night to be,” she told me. “But at the moment I thought, Maybe we can base the movie on this article.” For several hours, del Castillo served as translator. They discussed Hugo Chávez, the Mexican government, and Donald Trump. El Chapo seemed genuinely curious about whether the American public knew who he was. Penn told him that he would like to hang around for two more days. El Chapo replied that this was impossible. He suggested that they reconvene eight days later. Penn said that he would be happy to do so. He also offered to give their host final approval of the story. Of that decision, Wenner told the _Times_, “It was a small thing to do in exchange for what we got.”\n\n\n\nThroughout, El Chapo was solicitous of del Castillo—pulling out her chair for her, pouring her tequila, asking why she was not eating. “_Amiga_, I think you have to go to sleep,” he said, eventually. He stood, telling the others that he was going to escort del Castillo to her bedroom.\n\n\n\nAs he led her down a corridor, he held her elbow. They stopped in a doorway to a room filled with several beds—one of them, presumably hers, behind a screen. She believed, she said, that El Chapo might assault her: “So I say, ‘What the fuck, I might as well say my last words.’ I told him, ‘_Amigo_, you know why I’m here. And you know what I wrote about you. You’re a very powerful man. And you can do a lot of good. There’s a good man inside of you. So let’s do it.’ ”\n\n\n\n“You know what, _amiga_?” she recalls him replying. “You have a big heart.”\n\n\n\nHe gestured to the bed behind the screen. “This is where you’ll sleep,” he told her. “You’re not going to see me after this, because I don’t sleep where my guests are. It’s for their security.” He added, “Thanks for giving me one of the best days of my life.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nPenn and El Chapo never met again. A few days later, Mexican troops began conducting raids in the area. One evening in early November, del Castillo and Penn met with Ibáñez at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where he was staying. On his iPad, they filmed a video in which Penn proposed to El Chapo that he be interviewed on tape. Later, Penn sent del Castillo an encrypted e-mail with twenty-two questions for her to translate and send to El Chapo. She did so, while telling the trafficker, “After this article, we’ll begin with the movie.”\n\n\n\n\n\nOn December 5th, a package from El Chapo was sent by courier from Mexico to New York, where del Castillo flew to retrieve it. Inside an envelope was a cell phone with a seventeen-minute video of the drug lord nervously and perfunctorily answering only some of Penn’s questions, which were read aloud to him by a man off-camera. Some of the questions Penn had submitted were pointed, if open-ended: whether his products “contribute to the destruction of mankind,” how he justified the use of violence, whether he regarded his business as a “cartel,” whether the Mexican government and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration were corrupt, how he laundered his money, what he thought of the movement to legalize drugs. To most of these El Chapo responded indirectly or not at all. Other, more fanciful lines of inquiry—did he have recurring dreams, how would he describe his relationship with his mother, what kind of future did he wish for his children—elicited game but uncomprehending replies.\n\n\n\nBefore receiving El Chapo’s responses, Penn had begun writing an initial version of the story. _Rolling Stone_ translated a draft into Spanish, and del Castillo sent it to El Chapo for his approval. He texted back, “_Amiga_, I approve.” She took this message to Penn’s house in Malibu, where Jason Fine, the managing editor of _Rolling Stone_, was helping him with revisions.\n\n\n\nA few realizations began to dawn on del Castillo, she says now. One was that though she and Sulichin had hoped that Penn might eventually show interest in joining their movie project, it had become clear that he had no such desire. Moreover, El Chapo had given his approval to a version of a story that was still being revised by the writer and his editor. Most of all, del Castillo had been slow to recognize the trouble that awaited her. She had been surprised when Penn told her, early on, that she should retain the services of a criminal-defense attorney. But now she did so. \n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b65c557b86d47b169c89e]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nOn December 19th, del Castillo spoke by phone with Alonso Aguilar Zinser, a prominent criminal-defense attorney in Mexico City. Del Castillo described in detail her interactions with El Chapo, including the meeting with Sean Penn and the imminent publication of the story in _Rolling Stone_. Zinser advised her that he did not think she was guilty of any crimes. He said that he would be back in touch with her after he returned from a two-week vacation. But on Thursday, January 7th, Zinser told her that he would not be taking the case, citing a conflict of interest with existing clients. (In response to my questions, Zinser did not elaborate, beyond saying that he was not representing anyone in the federal government or any of Guzmán’s associates.)\n\n\n\nThat evening—the unofficial beginning of Golden Globes weekend—Penn invited del Castillo to join him and two friends for an after-dinner drink at the Sunset Tower Hotel, in West Hollywood. When she sat down, Penn handed her his phone. On its screen was the final layout of his story, “El Chapo Speaks.” In this version were details that had not appeared in the earliest drafts that she had discussed with a lawyer for Wenner Media. Penn had apparently misheard her description of how El Chapo’s lawyers had been unable to find her mailing address. Penn’s rendition in the story—“She nervously offered her address, but with the gypsy movements of an actress, the flowers did not find her”—made it seem, in her mind, that she had been encouraging Guzmán’s courtship even before a movie project had been on the table. (Penn maintains that his version is correct.) Del Castillo scrolled through Penn’s article, and, according to his friends, she gave no indication that she was upset. She says that she left the bar without reading the story in its entirety.\n\n\n\nLater, she noticed a scene that had not appeared in the version that had been sent to El Chapo. In a draft that had been sent to del Castillo around Christmas, there was a note from Fine, remarking on the long drive to see El Chapo: “*DESCRIPTION FEELS A LITTLE TOO GENERALIZED. LET’S ADD MORE DETAILS OF THE RIDE, THE EXPERIENCE, THE TERRAIN, WHAT PEOPLE SAY—BLOW BY BLOW OVER THAT SEVEN HOURS*{: .small}.” The final version included this addition: “And then, as it seems we are at the entrance of Oz, the highest peak visibly within reach, we arrive at a military checkpoint. Two uniformed government soldiers, weapons at the ready, approach our vehicle. Alfredo lowers his passenger window; the soldiers back away, looking embarrassed, and wave us through. Wow. So it is, the power of a Guzmán face. And the corruption of an institution.” This scene, del Castillo maintains, did not occur: they didn’t go through any military checkpoint, much less one where government soldiers waved them on. Sulichin and Ibáñez, who were in the car ahead of del Castillo and Penn, also have no recollection of encountering a military checkpoint. (Penn maintains that his version is correct.) The lawyer for Wenner Media apparently did not bring up this incident to del Castillo, but a representative for _Rolling Stone_ pointed out that she saw the final version on Penn’s phone and did not mention the discrepancy before publication.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe following day, January 8th, at 12:19 *p.m.*{: .small}, Enrique Peña Nieto, the President of Mexico, exulted on Twitter. “Mission accomplished: we have him,” he wrote. “I wish to inform the Mexican people that Joaquín Guzmán Loera has been captured.” A few hours later, Arely Gómez González, the country’s attorney general, told reporters that the government had been tracking El Chapo’s whereabouts for months, thanks in part to his interactions with people who had no obvious connection to his drug empire. Gómez said, “He established communication with actresses and producers, which is part of a new line of investigation.”\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen del Castillo heard that, she said, “I wanted to die.”\n\n\n\nThe next morning, Gerardo Reyes, a reporter with Univision, called her. Reyes had learned from a source in the Mexican government that one of the actors the attorney general had referred to was del Castillo.\n\n\n\nShe hung up on Reyes. After a second reporter contacted her, she recalls thinking, I’m calling Sean, I’m calling everybody. She told Jason Fine that her name had been leaked to the press. That evening, two days earlier than planned, _Rolling Stone_ posted Penn’s story on its Web site. The article, which was ten thousand words long, was widely circulated, but criticism quickly followed. In the San Francisco _Chronicle_, John Diaz wrote, “For those of us who care about the profession, and the daily threat to our brethren who practice it in one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists, Penn’s scoop was nothing to envy.” On Twitter, people used the hashtag #NoSeanPenndejos—which can be roughly translated as “Don’t be stupid assholes”—to heap scorn on the actor. This January, during a lengthy interview on “60 Minutes,” Penn said, “My article has failed.” He added, “The entire discussion about this article ignores its purpose, which was to try to contribute to this discussion about the policy in the war on drugs.”\n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b65c75d2f45736c34cf5a]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn conceded that the story was what he termed “experiential journalism,” a characterization that the press picked up on. “You’re talking to the biggest criminal in the world, and you ask him if he loves his mother,” Sabina Berman, a Mexican essayist and playwright who has written extensively about El Chapo, said to me. “And you don’t ask him, O.K., is the Army working with you? Who distributes the drugs in America? Who are your partners, or are you distributing them yourself? How about the police in America, the D.E.A.—is it true that they have a pact with you? What about the heroin trade that is growing in America—is it you or is it someone else?” She added, “This was no interview. This was a publicity stunt.”\n\n\n\nLater, Fine texted del Castillo and asked if he could meet her in Los Angeles and interview her for another _Rolling Stone_ story. “I didn’t even answer him, I was so mad,” she says.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nDel Castillo “has always been impulsive and straightforward,” the Mexican TV host and clothing designer Montserrat Oliver, one of del Castillo’s closest friends, told me. During the 2000 Presidential election, she had vocally supported the opposition candidate, Vicente Fox, incurring the displeasure of her employer, Grupo Televisa. A few months after del Castillo’s initial tweet, she played a starring role in “Colosio,” a historical drama about the Mexican Presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, who was assassinated in 1994. The movie’s release coincided with the 2012 elections, and it was widely thought to have been timed to embarrass the country’s powerful Partido Revolucianario Institucional. “This time, I think it went further than what she thought might happen,” Oliver continued. “The government must be very mad at her. If I were the President and these actors come and make a fool out of me, I’d be pissed, too.” The Mexican historian and essayist Enrique Krauze told me, “There’s an immense risk in approaching a person that has done such harm with a sympathetic view. Even as a biographer, I can tell you that. I don’t care if his father didn’t like him—I’m not moved by that, any more than I’m moved by Hitler’s pathetic past. The main point is that she was talking to a mass murderer. And, in the process of doing that, reality became fiction. While travelling to see him and exchanging messages, she was living out her most outrageous and extraordinary film work.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the capture of El Chapo and the publication of Penn’s story, it soon became evident that the Mexican government was singling out del Castillo as a target of investigation. Though El Chapo may well have exchanged texts with a number of people while in hiding, only the conversations with del Castillo were leaked to the Mexican media. In an interview with _El Universal_ on January 19th, Attorney General Gómez said that her office was investigating del Castillo for money laundering. Gómez referred to the actress’s tequila business and to the movie project as potential areas of financial collusion with the drug trafficker. Asked if other people were being investigated in connection to the movie project, Gómez replied, “For the moment, no. The only person involved for the moment is her, and the investigation will inform us if there are other persons.” As for Penn, Gómez said only, “The federal attorney general’s office affirms that he is not being investigated for anything.”\n\n\n\nThis public statement appeared to be a violation of Mexican law, which forbids disclosure of any information pertinent to an ongoing investigation, including the name of the person being investigated. Indeed, a spokesperson for Gómez declined my request for an interview with her to discuss the case, writing, “Under the guarantees of the law and of due process, we are barred from fulfilling your request.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn Mexico, the saga of _El Chapo y Kate_ has provided a distraction from far graver domestic issues: the unsolved disappearance, in 2014, of forty-three students in Guerrero; the deaths, that year, of an estimated eight thousand people in activity related to organized crime; the decrease in value of the peso against the dollar to all-time lows.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe charges that del Castillo could face—all of which she vigorously denies—are nonetheless serious. Money laundering, for example, carries a penalty of between five and twenty-five years, and the wording of the law is unusually broad. According to one of del Castillo’s Mexican lawyers (who, fearing reprisals from the government, requested anonymity), “It’s so broad that anyone can be found guilty under that definition. As an actual example, she used the planes of El Chapo to go to their meeting.”\n\n\n\nOn the advice of her attorneys, del Castillo has remained in Los Angeles. Federal law in Mexico permits the authorities to place her under house arrest, without bringing charges against her, for up to eighty days. She had been expecting to be in Mexico now, filming scenes for a new Netflix series, “Ingobernable.” It features del Castillo as Emilia Urquiza, the First Lady of Mexico, whose husband is mysteriously killed, prompting her dangerous quest for justice. A representative for Netflix told me that del Castillo will remain in the series. Epigmenio Ibarra, the creator of “Ingobernable,” said, “We thought about the series with Kate in mind for over a year now.” He added, “Through her past roles, she has redefined what a female character can be in Hispanic television.”\n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b65c98a032b339a0cd6de]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nFollowing the publication of Penn’s article in _Rolling Stone_, del Castillo spent two weeks sequestered in her house, in order to avoid reporters and photographers. To cheer her up, friends from Mexico sent her images of piñatas bearing her likeness and YouTube clips of balladeers crooning reverent _corridos_ about her exploits with El Chapo. When she finally ventured out with a friend one Saturday night, to the Mexican restaurant El Coyote, on Beverly Boulevard, she was confronted in the parking lot by a cameraman from TMZ.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring three days of conversation I had with del Castillo, she was always wearing casual but elegant clothes. She was at times contrite, lamenting at one point, “See, I just do things, and I never see the consequences.” She repeatedly emphasized that she condemned El Chapo’s criminality. But she also echoed the affinity for him that she displayed in her initial tweet. She seemed sympathetic to El Chapo’s frequent claim that he fell into the drug trade because his impoverished community in Sinaloa offered no economic alternative. Del Castillo told me, “I can relate to that. Because I should be in Mexico. I love Mexico and I’ve been an actress since I was nine. It’s been a heartbreak to me to leave my country to have to find something else because my country didn’t provide me with those opportunities.”\n\n\n\nDel Castillo regards the Mexican government’s investigation of her as “a witch hunt.” She sees elements of sexism in the media’s depiction of her: “They always mention my age. They don’t talk about Sean’s age, or him being in love with or admiring El Chapo.” Though she clearly wants to avoid making enemies in Hollywood, she worries that Penn, Sulichin, and Ibáñez might have somehow left her exposed when they did not insist on including her as a journalist on assignment in the letter that Jann Wenner gave to Penn. Her movie project with a notorious criminal has not turned out as planned, but del Castillo maintains that the endeavor is a worthy one, and that she intends to see it through to completion.\n\n\n\nShe can apparently still count on the support of El Chapo. Last month, one of the trafficker’s lawyers told the Associated Press, “I know that Kate is Mr. Joaquín Guzmán’s representative. . . . And he told me Monday that the movie has to go forward.” ♦\n\n\n\n*An earlier version of this article misstated the location of del Castillo’s appointment.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/21/kate-del-castillo-sean-penn-and-el-chapo","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ce56e652c90274666","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Actresses","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"actresses"},{"id":"5c2e1cb92bc86f2c9a244a00","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Criminals","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"criminals"},{"id":"5c2e1ef52bc86f2c9a244bf8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mexicans","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mexicans"},{"id":"5c2e1c8a41c92e2c9b85da3d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5c2e1f3d397f5b30646d0876","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Prison Escapes","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"prison-escapes"},{"id":"5c2e1cd736cecf4019214273","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sean Penn","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sean-penn"},{"id":"5c2e1ca52bfcc72cd92d055e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Twitter","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"twitter"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef12019dfc3494e9c8f2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"A Reporter at Large","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"a-reporter-at-large"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a7cb6c4c222f03a82e32","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/robert-draper","email":"","name":"Robert Draper","socialMedia":[],"title":"Robert Draper is a writer at large for the _Times Magazine_ and a contributing writer for _National Geographic_. “Do Not Ask What Good We Do: Inside the U.S. House of Representatives” is his most recent book."}]},"dek":"The Mexican actress who dazzled El Chapo.","hed":"The Go-Between","inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"March 21, 2016","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2017-10-23T01:41:29.547Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"590974f52179605b11ad81b8","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":2560,"height":1919,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/tny-services/production/2017/05/03/590974f52179605b11ad81b7_160321_r27824.jpg"}},"caption":"Kate del Castillo at home in Los Angeles.

On February 14th, the Web site and social-media feeds of the [March for Our Lives](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/march-for-our-lives), the youth-led gun-control movement that began in the aftermath of the shooting, will go dark. The founders of the movement will not give interviews or make any public comments. \n\n“It’s about recognizing that we need to take time for ourselves because we’ve been going so strongly for the past year without a breather,” Jaclyn Corin, a senior at Stoneman Douglas and one of the co-founders of the movement, told me in a recent phone call. “We’re giving ourselves that time to be with our friends and our family.”\n\nLast year, on February 15th, I travelled to Parkland to cover the tragedy and was surprised to find myself also documenting the rise of a political movement. Along with the rest of the country, I watched as Sarah Chadwick, Cameron Kasky, Delaney Tarr, David Hogg, and their classmates addressed the media and lawmakers with a controlled fury and eloquence made more potent by their youth. Three days later, I attended a rally organized by the Broward County school board in nearby Fort Lauderdale, where a Parkland senior named [Emma González](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-passion-of-emma-gonzalez) made what seems to be the first speech with national resonance by a member of her generation. \n\nHer concluding refrain, “[We Call B.S.](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/three-days-in-parkland-florida),” has been printed on buttons and painted on signs. It’s easy to forget how spontaneous it was, written from a place of raw emotion and delivered with urgency by someone with a preternatural rhetorical talent. It was also informed by being a member of a generation that has had to train for school shootings for years. As González said that day, “The students at this school have been having debates on guns for what feels like our entire lives.” \n\nFrom the beginning, what made the March for Our Lives students seem different was the simple fact that they believed that the worsening epidemic of gun violence in this country could actually be fixed. Only days after the shooting, they directly lobbied representatives in the Florida state capital of Tallahassee and in Washington, D.C. On March 14, 2018, to commemorate a month since the event and to advocate for stricter gun laws, they led more than a million students to walk out of schools across the country. On March 24th, hundreds of thousands of people rallied outside the Capitol for the March for Our Lives, the largest youth protest in Washington since the Vietnam War. Another walkout followed, on April 20th, the nineteenth anniversary of the shooting at Columbine High School, in Littleton, Colorado. \n\nThe protest phase of the movement mostly ended there, but the young activists continued their work. They organized two bus tours to encourage young people to vote, one in Florida and one that toured nationwide, and registered thousands of young voters over the summer. They held public meetings and formed alliances with other local youth gun-control activists—Good Kids Mad City and the Peace Warriors—and survivors of mass shootings in Santa Fe, Texas; Aurora, Colorado; and the Red Lake Indian Reservation, in Northern Minnesota, among many other places. They showed their commitment not only to ending mass shootings but to educating the public on the ways that guns increase the likelihood of fatality in acts of suicide, domestic violence, and gang strife. During a fall college tour, they continued their voter-registration push, partnering with Rock the Vote and the N.A.A.C.P. \n\nPreviously, mass shootings had been met with collective mourning followed by inaction. The students condemned the inertia. They perfected the art of puncturing the N.R.A.’s attacks on proposals like universal background checks and banning assault rifles. They encouraged voters to see gun violence not as some kind of natural disaster but as rooted in policy decisions made by elected officials who should be held responsible. Fixing the problem would require the will of the people with power. The students asked, rightly: Where was the will? Why were adults so inept at protecting their children?\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe March for Our Lives students marked the beginning of a year of youth activism, but it would be a mistake to say that they ignited it. Youth activism had been growing for several years: United We Dream, the youth-led immigrant organization that advocated for the *DREAM*{: .small} act and occupied the halls of Congress last spring, was founded in 2008; the anti-racism and anti-police-violence movement Black Lives Matter, which has since grown into the Movement for Black Lives, started in 2013\\. Young people who worked for Bernie Sanders’s 2016 Presidential campaign went on to revive the Democratic Socialists of America as a political force and, in some cases, ran for office themselves. The [Sunrise Movement](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-optimistic-activists-for-a-green-new-deal-inside-the-youth-led-singing-sunrise-movement), the youth-led climate-change-advocacy group that has helped put the proposal for a Green New Deal on the Democratic policy agenda, started in late 2017. And, as the Parkland students discovered when they began their work, there was already a network of youth activists working to end the epidemic of gun violence. \n\nA lot of this work coalesced in the [2018 midterms](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/midterms-2018), which were seen even by nonpartisan organizations like March for Our Lives as an opportunity to question the complacency of Congress, where the reëlection rate has traditionally been about ninety per cent. Young former Bernie Sanders staffers started the political-action committee Brand New Congress with the intention of reviving a primary election cycle that in many districts was merely symbolic. Brand New Congress recruited a dozen candidates. One actually won her election: [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/23/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-historic-win-and-the-future-of-the-democratic-party). By that time, the group had merged with Justice Democrats, a political-action committee that supported the candidacies of Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib. All of these groups emphasized youth-voter turnout—and an estimated thirty-one per cent of eligible voters between the ages of nineteen and twenty-nine turned out in the 2018 elections. The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning & Engagement, out of Tufts University, reported that that number, as low as it is, represented the highest youth turnout in a midterm election since 1982\\. \n\nThe Green New Deal, gun control, and Medicare for All are now seen as central issues in the 2020 Presidential primaries, but March for Our Lives has chosen to advocate for issues rather than individual candidates. Along with groups like Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety, March for Our Lives can claim credit for changing laws. In 2018, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, sixty-seven gun-safety bills were signed into law in twenty-six states and Washington, D.C. On February 6th, March for Our Lives founders joined the parents of slain Stoneman Douglas students at the first House hearings on gun violence in eight years.\n\nAs the Parkland students and others from their generation have shown, there is much political momentum to be gained simply by describing what is wrong with greater urgency: a broken health-insurance system; several generations who collectively owe more than one and a half trillion dollars in student loans; the existential threats of climate change, gun violence, police violence, stagnant wages, and widening inequality. But, unlike previous generations of youth activists, the ones today are eager to work within the existing political processes. Asked if a year of close scrutiny of electoral politics had left him disillusioned, Matt Deitsch, one of the March for Our Lives co-founders, told me that it had not. “It’s not about being disillusioned, it’s about being upset.” He quoted Marjory Stoneman Douglas, the namesake of his alma mater, who was an advocate for the preservation of the Everglades: “Be a nuisance when it counts.”\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nEarlier this week, I accompanied a group of Sunrise Movement activists as they visited the Los Angeles office of Dianne Feinstein, a senator from California, hoping to encourage her to support the resolution for a Green New Deal. Like the youth gun-control activists, they describe the issues they face as not abstract but genuine fears. \n\n“People who are in their sixties right now don’t need to worry about these things nearly as much as we do,” a Sunrise volunteer and third-year student at U.C.L.A. named Natalie Rotstein said. “I’m surrounded by friends who don’t want to have kids because they don’t feel like they can in good conscience put children into the imminent apocalypse that looks like our future right now. It’s such an everyday, grinding kind of acceptance that there’s probably going to be an apocalypse within our lifetime, and nobody is really doing anything to stop it, so it’s the young people who feel the need to save our own futures because no one else is doing it.”\n\nThe group of twenty or so activists proceeded across Santa Monica Boulevard into the glossy lobby of a building where Feinstein’s office is on an upper floor. Security would not let them upstairs. When two of Feinstein’s staffers descended from an elevator to meet with the activists, they found them sitting in a circle on the floor, listening to a song about the recent California wildfires performed by a seventeen-year-old singer-songwriter and high-school student named Arielle Martinez Cohen. The activists were then relocated to an atrium between the office building and the parking deck. Peter Muller, Feinstein’s deputy state director, received their complaints under the decorative plant walls there. Asked why Feinstein had not yet endorsed the proposal, Muller replied that the senator is a very deliberative person who reviews things very closely. At this the crowd erupted with anxiety: “We don’t have a lot of time!” “There is no time!”\n\n“She’s been my representative my entire life, and these issues have existed since I was born!” a twenty-five-year-old Sunrise volunteer named Ruby Dutcher said. Muller agreed to meet with a smaller group of activists in the office upstairs. In a scene I had watched play out many times in the past year, beginning with the lukewarm reception of lawmakers in Tallahassee to their visitors from Parkland, a staffer promised once again to relay the views of the young people to the person in power, as the young people made clear that the time for deliberation had passed.

place, if the plaintiffs in a gun-control case that the Supreme Court has just agreed to hear are to be believed. The suit, which calls the city’s restrictions on transporting handguns through its streets “bizarre,” “irrational,” and “perverse,” was brought by the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association—the state affiliate of the [National Rifle Association](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/national-rifle-association)—along with two gun owners who live in the Bronx and one from Staten Island. The case is notable for reasons that go beyond its caricature of the city and its mores. To begin with, this will be the first time the Court seriously considers the Second Amendment since it adopted a radical view of gun rights in District of Columbia v. Heller, in 2008, which overturned a near-ban on handguns in Washington, D.C., and in McDonald v. the City of Chicago, in 2010, which did away with similar restrictions in that city. Those decisions were “transformational,” the plaintiffs argue, but “the news has not yet reached New York City.”\n\nIt will also be the first opportunity for the Court’s newest member, Justice [Brett Kavanaugh](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brett-kavanaugh), to begin building what promises to be a disastrous pro-gun legacy. Heller, a 5–4 decision written by Justice [Antonin Scalia](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/antonin-scalia), upended the way that generations of judges had read the Second Amendment, by recognizing a fundamental, individual right to bear arms, unconnected to a “well-regulated militia.” McDonald then confirmed that Heller could be used to overturn state and local gun laws, as well as federal legislation. Still, both decisions leave room for some basic, long-standing restrictions on guns, such as those that prevent violent felons from buying them. Kavanaugh, though, in the wake of Heller, appears ready to toss out as many restrictions as he can. As an appeals-court judge, he wrote, in a 2011 dissent, that the District of Columbia should not be allowed to ban semi-automatic assault rifles, largely because they were “in common use.” He added that asking people to register their guns is unconstitutional.\n\nThe New York case has certain elements in common with Heller: it is a challenge to a municipal regulation which has the potential to loosen laws around the country. The very strictness of the regulation may have made it an appealing target. It is possible, but difficult, to get a license to carry a handgun in New York. An alternative is a “premises” license, which allows an owner to have a handgun in his or her home but also, under a city regulation that has been in force since 2001, requires that owner to _keep_ it at home. With a few narrow exceptions, owners can only take their guns out of the house, unloaded and in a locked case, to go to a shooting range in the city which has certification from the N.Y.P.D. There are seven such ranges, with at least one in each of the five boroughs.\n\nThe plaintiffs want to be able to take their guns to second homes or to shooting ranges out of town. They take the view that preventing them from travelling through the streets with their guns actually increases the risk to public safety, in part by forcing them to leave their weapons “in their vacant New York residences,” where anything could happen. One brief suggested that the city might be “underestimating its burglars.” (Crime rates in New York have, in fact, gone down dramatically in recent decades; the number of shootings is the lowest it has been in twenty-five years.) The plaintiffs also claim that being asked to travel without their guns is akin to being forbidden to travel at all—as though a person were not constitutionally whole without a gun. To them, the restriction is as profound a violation of rights as “a prohibition on leaving city limits to get an abortion.”\n\nAn overriding issue at stake, then, is whether the Court will decide that the right to “bear” arms is tantamount to a broad right to travel with them. (Justice [Clarence Thomas](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/clarence-thomas) has said, with regard to an earlier case, that he emphatically believes it is.) Gun regulations now vary widely among the states; the strictest of them may eventually be forced to conform to the loosest. A far greater risk to public safety than leaving handguns in empty apartments is the nationwide effort to sanctify the right to carry weapons, concealed or openly, in public places. A majority of states now permit “open carry”—some of them even in bars, stadiums, and day-care centers—and some impose onerous requirements on stores, restaurants, and other businesses that seek to ban guns from their premises. Rates of gun deaths vary, too; they are about six times higher in Alaska and Louisiana—states with very lax gun laws—than they are in New York.\n\nThe Justices, in seeking a national standard in the wake of Heller, will, in effect, decide which type of situation is truly “bizarre.” They may do so partly by answering a question that Heller and McDonald left open: What level of “scrutiny” should be applied to gun-control laws in balancing valid government interests, such as public safety, against the individual right recognized by Heller? Kavanaugh, for his part, has written that public safety should not be a determining factor—only “text, history, and tradition” really matter. With that view, he exceeds what had, until recently, been the gun lobby’s wildest hopes.\n\nMeanwhile, the movement to pass stricter gun laws has been gathering strength. A recent Gallup poll found that more than sixty per cent of Americans are in favor of them. There is a growing revulsion at a state of affairs that has made lockdown drills a rite of passage for kindergartners—not least from schoolchildren themselves, who, as the students at [Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/parkland-school-shooting), in Parkland, Florida, have shown, can be powerful advocates for saner laws. Candidates who support gun control won significant victories in the midterm elections, some of them—such as Representatives Lucy McBath, of Georgia, and Jason Crow, of Colorado—in red and purple states. According to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, forty members of Congress who had been regarded as N.R.A. stalwarts lost their seats.\n\nThat political will is set to collide with the ideological priorities of the Court’s conservatives. The larger conflict will play out in the 2020 campaign, as voters decide whether Donald Trump will get to appoint even more judges who share an expansive view of gun rights. In 2011, Kavanaugh wrote that, after Heller, “D.C. seemed not to heed the Supreme Court’s message.” The echo of that language in the plaintiffs’ portrayal of New York is probably not accidental; gun-rights advocates have been waiting for Kavanaugh, or someone like him. Their brief was submitted on the day his confirmation hearings began. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"comment"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a01ff019dfc3494ea4158","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Amy Davidson Sorkin became a staff writer in 2014.

They had trickled in from all over the country, in vans and buses, carrying backpacks and sleeping bags, some of them college students and others still in high school. They belonged to an environmental movement called Sunrise, and they had come to the capital to pressure their congressional representatives on the issue of climate change. The next day would be one of visits and protests, where the young people planned to lobby the incoming Democratic majority to begin work on a Green New Deal. The plan they hope to see adopted—to make the United States economy carbon neutral—would be nothing less than a total overhaul of our national infrastructure.\n\nSunrise, founded a year and a half ago by a dozen or so twentysomethings, began its campaign for the Green New Deal last month, when two hundred activists occupied Nancy Pelosi’s office a week after the midterm elections. The movement has allied with the incoming congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who joined them outside Pelosi’s office (and whose run for Congress was inspired, in part, by her participation in the anti-pipeline protests at Standing Rock), and Justice Democrats, the progressive campaign incubator started by former staffers of Bernie Sanders. As the Republican-led government has forced more established environmental organizations into defensive positions, Sunrise has established itself as the dominant influence on the environmental policy of the Democratic Party’s young, progressive wing. \n\nJust as [the March for Our Lives](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/march-for-our-lives) has changed gun-control activism from a movement of grieving parents to one led by students, Sunrise is part of a generational shift in the environmental movement. For years, rhetoric about climate change has invoked the future generations who will have to live with the flooding, storms, droughts, diseases, and food shortages of a warmer world. The young people of Sunrise are telling lawmakers that the future is here: they are the children in question, and the consequences of climate change are affecting them now. And, like other activist movements of their generation, they see their cause as inseparable from the broader issues of economic and social inequality. In a proposal that Ocasio-Cortez has circulated in Congress, she describes the Green New Deal as “a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States.”\n\nInside Luther Place Memorial Church, cheers erupted as activists unfurled a yellow and black “*GREEN NEW DEAL NOW*{:.small}” banner from the balcony. The crowd hushed as the first speaker, Varshini Prakash, came to the microphone. Prakash, who is five feet tall and has long curly hair, is one of Sunrise’s co-founders. She later told me that a highlight of her activism career was when she participated in a musical disruption of a Trump Administration panel at the United Nations climate conference in Bonn, in 2017, and a story about it trended on Reddit. \n  \n“We’re going to kick things off the way we always do,” Prakash said, “raising our voices in unison in song.” Part of what makes the Sunrise Movement’s activists seem so optimistic is that they conduct most of their protests while singing. Their ranks did not conform to the dour stereotype of an environmental movement composed of white-upper-middle-class Appalachian Mountain Club members. I spoke to Sunrise members whose families had roots in India, Iran, Croatia, Mexico, and working-class neighborhoods in American cities. There were some students in Carhartts and beanies, who looked like they might go camping, but one young person standing near me wore a Sisters sweatshirt, the brand started by the YouTube makeup artist James Charles, who is the first male spokesperson for CoverGirl. Sunrise’s principles include: “We are Americans from all walks of life,” “We are nonviolent in word and deed,” and “We shine bright.” The dominant culture is cheerfulness.\n\nAfter leading the group in a song called “We’re Going to Rise Up,” Prakash introduced herself. She is from a town outside of Boston, but her grandparents are from southern India, and she told the story of a flood that hit their city, Chennai, in late 2015, when the region experienced its highest rainfall in a hundred years. This was typical of Sunrise members, who tend not to talk about starving polar bears, melting ice caps, or ocean acidification. Instead, they talk of family members who have lost their homes to floods or fires, young relatives who have asthma, or beloved landscapes that have been degraded or destroyed in the spans of their short lifetimes. (Another movement principle: “We tell our stories and we honor each other’s stories.”)\n\n“I think no one should have to live in fear of losing the people that they love or the places that they call home due to crises that are preventable,” Prakash told the crowd. “My nightmares are full of starving children and land that is too sick to bear food, of water that poisons that which it should heal, and of seas that are ever more creeping on our shores,” she continued. “But my dreams are also full of a rising tide of people who see the world for what it is, people who see the greed and selfishness of wealthy men, of fossil-fuel billionaires who plunder our earth for profit.” The young people cheered.\n\nMany of Sunrise’s founders met through the fossil-fuel divestment movement, but they tend to cite inspirations from outside environmentalism. Prakash named Occupy Wall Street, the Movement for Black Lives, and youth-led immigration-justice organizations such as United We Dream and Cosecha. Like the March for Our Lives, Sunrise has told a story of a corrupt political process, where oil and gas billionaires like the Koch brothers have helped direct governmental policies. Also like March for Our Lives, Sunrise has focussed on the development of clear, nonpartisan policy goals. Its members are working within existing political structures, pressuring politicians to take more active stances on the issue of climate change and to reject donations from fossil-fuel entities, and getting out the youth vote. \n\n“Our strategy for 2019 is going to be continuing this momentum to build the people power and the political power to make a Green New Deal a political inevitability in America,” Prakash told me. “In 2020, we, along with our partners, are going to be attempting to build the largest youth political force this country has ever seen.” The movement has received support from established environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club and 350\\.org, but a spokesperson for Sunrise, Stephen O’Hanlon, said the assistance has been primarily non-financial. He added that the organization has raised less than a million dollars since it was started, from a mix of grants from foundations and grassroots donors. \n\nStaffers from the Ocasio-Cortez campaign first met with Sunrise at a dinner last summer. Immediately after the November demonstration, Ocasio-Cortez put forward her resolution, drafted in partnership with Sunrise and Justice Democrats, to form a select committee on a Green New Deal in the House of Representatives. \n\nThe resolution calls for a transition to a hundred per cent renewable energy by 2030, the upgrade of residential and industrial buildings to greater energy efficiency, the decarbonization of manufacturing and agriculture, and investment in technology that would reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. If put forward, it would be the most ambitious climate policy the Democratic Party has ever endorsed. For Sunrise, it is the only policy initiative that matches the scope of the crisis.\n\n“We know, from looking at history, that transformation of the scale demanded by science has only happened under two conditions in our history,” one activist told me, at the gathering in the church. “First, when the public has united to address a clear and present threat, and, second, when political leaders have put forward solutions that clearly address that threat and that are clear answers to the crisis.” In its statements, Sunrise makes patriotic appeals to ambitious mobilizations in America’s past, from the Public Works Administration to the moon landing—contrasting a vision of technological innovation and ambition with one of a kleptocratic petro state.\n\nSince Sunrise’s first sit-in, more than forty Democratic representatives have endorsed Ocasio-Cortez’s resolution, including the heads of the progressive caucus, rising stars in the Party like Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, and Joe Kennedy, and veteran activists like John Lewis. But, as Waleed Shahid, the communications director with Justice Democrats, told me, it really only needs the endorsement of one person: the incoming Speaker of the House. So they had come to visit Pelosi once again.\n\nThe next morning, at eight, the activists assembled in the Spirit of Justice Park, outside of Congress. Before occupying the offices of the Democratic leadership, they were going to lobby some fifty Democratic representatives. They took off toward the congressional office buildings singing a song condemning the fossil-fuel economy, whose refrain went, “Which side are you on now? Which side are you on?” \n\nI joined a delegation of about sixty young people who had bussed up from Kentucky as they visited John Yarmuth, the state’s sole Democratic congressperson. Most of them were high schoolers from Louisville and Lexington. They were met at the door by one of Yarmuth’s staffers, who stood and listened while the visitors began their prepared presentation. \n\n“We’re here because we’ve witnessed the failure of political leadership on climate change for as long as we’ve been alive,” a college freshman named Quincy Robinson said, referring to notes on his phone. “The latest United Nations report on climate change gives us just twelve years to rapidly transform society and economies to stop the climate crisis.” \n\nAnother student, Trevor Harry, told a story about canoeing in Beargrass Creek in downtown Louisville, which has been polluted with waste from pig farms. He described some of the legislative goals that the select committee would research, including massive investment in renewable energy, upgrading public transit, and a jobs guarantee with living wages. “It would be the first committee to approach the crisis as the integrated social, scientific, and economic challenge that it is,” Harry said. \n\nThe staffer politely promised to give Yarmuth the message.\n\n The main action of the day took place midmorning, when the protesters split into three groups, to visit the offices of Pelosi, Representative Steny Hoyer, the Democratic Whip from Maryland, and Jim McGovern, the Massachusetts representative who is poised to become the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee. A student from Grand Rapids said she was “fighting for our sacred places.” A student from Wilmington, Delaware, said she was there for “my community, which is already suffering from flooding from sea-level rise. ” A twelve-year-old activist from Denver named Haven Coleman spoke of the poor air quality on the northeast side of her city, where much of the population is Hispanic. “I fear the fires in the summers and the sun that stirs up the local fracking pollution and big car exhaust,” she said. “It leaks into my home, my lungs, sneaking in with the heat, there is no escaping its choke.” More than a hundred of the thousand protesters were arrested for obstructing the hallways while singing songs. \n\nOf the three House leaders, only McGovern appeared in person, stepping out of his office into the hallway. (Pelosi doesn’t use her offices in the Cannon House Office Building, but she works from the Capitol.)\n\n“I’ve met some of you before,” he said, scanning the group. “I’m here to talk about whatever you want.”\n\n“We’re hoping that you will support Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s select committee for a Green New Deal!” someone in the crowd said.\n\n“So the answer is I want to get to yes on that,” McGovern said. “But this is what we’re doing right now—we’re trying to figure out what the committee looks like, and this is a work in progress.”\n\nHe went on to talk about the House Committee on Rules, and jurisdictional issues—that some representatives on the Energy and Commerce Committee are worried their powers are being taken away. (Members of the Natural Resources Committee have also voiced such concerns.)\n\n“I’m working with Leader Pelosi right now to get something in place that’s real, that has money behind it, that’s funded, so there can be a staff, and that’s where we want to get to.” McGovern said. “We’re working on it and I hope that we can get it.”\n\nIt was not the most straightforward endorsement, but the activists took it as a victory nonetheless. In the weeks since the campaign began, Democratic leaders have agreed to revive a select committee on climate change, but have said that it will not be focussed on a Green New Deal, and may not have subpoena power. Speaking this week to the Hill, Hoyer described it as a “recommendatory committee to the Energy and Commerce Committee and the environmental committees.” \n\nIn response to Hoyer’s comment, Prakash said, in a statement, “If true, this decision is an insult to the thousands of young people across the country who have been calling on the Democratic Party leadership to have the courage to stand up to fossil-fuel billionaires and make sure our generation has a livable future.” \n\nCorbin Trent, a spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez, told me, “What I can say is that I think that if we didn’t already have an interstate highway system in this country I think it would be hard for the Democratic leadership in this country to see a way forward to create one,” he said. “At this moment in time, it seems like shooting for the moon is hard for our leaders to do.”\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\n\t\t\nOn Tuesday morning, the day after the protest in Washington, I met with four of the Sunrise Movement’s co-founders at a bakery near Washington’s Union Station. They had ended the previous day with a small party at the office of 350\\.org. The office of Ayanna Pressley, the newly elected Justice Democrats–endorsed representative from Massachusetts, had sent pizzas.\n\nOver oatmeal and coffee, they told me about their personal awakenings about climate change. Sara Blazevic, who is twenty-five and from New York City, went on a volunteer trip to New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, when she was sixteen. Victoria Fernandez, who is also twenty-five and from California, talked about how unseasonable rains had affected business at the tennis shop her father owns, in the Bay Area. Evan Weber, who is twenty-seven and grew up in Hawaii, told me that the beaches he had played on as a child in Oahu have since been washed away. Stephen O’Hanlon, twenty-three, who is from outside of Philadelphia, had witnessed the effects of mountaintop removal on a trip to Appalachia organized by a college group. \n\nIn late 2015 and early 2016, Prakash and Blazevic, who knew each other from the fossil-fuel divestment campaigns they had led in college, began connecting with other youth climate activists to discuss how they might form a more effective movement. They saw how Bernie Sanders had helped spark a new political energy among their peers, who were suddenly inspired to see their student debt and poor job prospects in more political terms. For Blazevic, the moment of clarity came in December, 2015, when she read remarks from Sanders in which he used the phrase “fossil-fuel billionaires.”\n\n“I remember being, like, ‘That is it, why are we not talking about the fossil-fuel billionaires in the climate movement?” she recalled. “I just remember feeling like this is the story that we should be telling in the climate movement. We should be talking about the people who are most responsible for this crisis, and naming names of the Rex Tillersons of the world instead of doing what the climate movement had been doing for a while, which was, at least, in my corner of it, getting lost in conflicts with college administrators over small pools of money.” \n\nTheir first meeting, in July, 2016, was in the Neighborhood Preservation Center in New York City. They agreed that they wanted to propose solutions to the climate crisis that match its magnitude. Since climate change disproportionately affects poor communities of color, they agreed that racial and economic justice had to be considered in any solution to climate change they proposed. \n\nThey arranged to meet once a month for the next nine months, renting houses or staying with volunteers in a different location each time. They went to an Amish farm in Pennsylvania, to Delaware, to Virginia. Their numbers grew to a dozen people. \t\n\nThey studied the wins and the losses of the climate movement in its forty-year history. They read books about how other mass movements had grown viral and gone to scale—Fernandez fished out a waterlogged copy of the book “[Rules for Revolutionaries](https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Revolutionaries-Organizing-Change-Everything/dp/1603587276/)” to give me one example. Others: “[Reinventing Organizations](https://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Organizations-Frederic-Laloux/dp/2960133501/),” by Frederic Laloux; “[Where Do We Go from Here](https://www.amazon.com/Where-Do-We-Here-Community/dp/0807000671/),” by Martin Luther King, Jr.; “[This Is an Uprising](https://www.amazon.com/This-Uprising-Nonviolent-Shaping-Twenty-First/dp/1568585705/),” by Mark and Paul Engler. Several of their members had attended a workshop at a social-movement training institute called Momentum, where they had studied how to effectively combine structured organizing with mass protest. \n\nThe idea was to build a movement that people would join to feel a part of some larger history. “In the Bernie moment, I was seeing so many young people who were, like, ‘I would drop everything to be a part of the political revolution,’ ” Blazevic said. “After the primary ended in their states, there wasn’t anything to be a part of, and we weren’t seeing many movements or organizations rising to that challenge of creating a way for those people to stay meaningfully engaged longer-term. We certainly weren’t seeing it in our own organizing in the climate movement.”\n\nAfter Trump’s election, they responded to the populism of the moment. “We think that the climate movement has missed a big opportunity to tap into the really genuine and valid frustration at the political class in this country that have for our whole lives chosen to prioritize their campaign donors over the interests of young people, of the American people at large,” O’Hanlan said. “So we are here naming who is responsible for this crisis, the fossil-fuel billionaires who have been buying out Washington, D.C.” \n\n“But a big part of our story is not just about naming who’s responsible but actually saying that we can do this, and that this is a problem that we can solve, which I think all of us believe in the deepest core of our hearts,” Weber interjected. “There are solutions that are ready to go and will make people’s lives better and create millions of good jobs, if we can just get these handful of wealthy billionaires and executives and lobbyists and the politicians they collude with out of the way.”

He’d spent the previous several days with an alarm set to go off every hour, to keep him from missing any breaking news. There had been a lot of it. On February 1st, the conservative Web site Big League Politics published a photo from the medical-school yearbook page of Governor [Ralph Northam](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-history-is-reflecting-on-the-political-leadership-of-virginia). In the photo, from 1984, one man wears blackface and another wears a Ku Klux Klan robe. Northam initially apologized for appearing in the photo, though he didn’t say which of the two men was him. The next day, at a press conference, [Northam insisted](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/ralph-northam-cant-see-himself-in-the-picture) that he wasn’t in the picture, after all—though he confessed that, at some point in 1984, he had worn shoe polish on his face (“I don’t know if anybody’s ever tried that, but you cannot get shoe polish off”), in order to resemble Michael Jackson at a dance contest.\n\n \n\nSoon afterward, Big League Politics reported on the existence of a private Facebook post in which a woman appeared to accuse the state’s lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, of sexual assault at the Democratic National Convention in 2004\\. Fairfax, who would become governor if Northam were to resign, denied the allegation; the woman subsequently came forward to reiterate the allegation in her own name. Two days after that, the attorney general, Mark Herring, who is also a Democrat, and currently second in the line of succession to be governor of Virginia, [admitted to wearing blackface](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/us/politics/virginia-blackface-mark-herring.html) at a party during his college years—he was in costume, he said, as the rap musician Kurtis Blow. By this point, many state and national Democrats were calling for Northam to resign, but many had not yet made up their minds about Fairfax and Herring.\n\n \n\nBy Friday, according to the Democratic aide, things had calmed down enough to make a nap possible. Before talking to the aide, I had spoken with a senior Democrat in the state, who, like the aide, requested anonymity, citing his relationship with other Party members. He, too, thought things were settling down. “If it was at the same level as it was previously, we wouldn’t be talking to you,” he said. “We’d still be on the phone trying to sort this out.” I asked why it had got better. “I’m not the one to question good things,” he said. “I don’t know. But it’s demonstrably slower today than it has been.” About an hour after we got off the phone, a second accuser went public with an allegation of sexual violence against Fairfax. Fairfax raped her, she said, when they were both students at Duke, two decades ago. The aide’s nap never came. The next morning, the chairwoman of Virginia’s Democratic Party, Susan Swecker, e-mailed a statement to the media calling on the lieutenant governor to resign. Fairfax has insisted that the second allegation is also false—both sexual encounters were consensual, he claims—and, like Northam, he has resisted the calls for his resignation. Herring, meanwhile, has stepped down from his position as co-chairman of the Democratic Attorneys General Association, and appears to be undecided about whether he will resign from office.\n\n \n\nIf all three men resigned, or were forced from office, the speaker of the Virginia house of delegates, the Republican Kirk Cox, would become governor. That fact appears to have complicated the calculus for many Democrats. Though some have maintained that wearing blackface is unforgivable under any circumstances, others have suggested that, in Northam’s case, it was such a long time ago, and, what’s more, his record as governor has been a boon to communities of color. Herring, meanwhile, was nineteen at the time of the Kurtis Blow incident, and hasn’t offered conflicting accounts of any yearbook pictures. Fairfax, on the other hand, has few defenders, given the violent nature of the multiple allegations against him—though President Donald Trump has tried to suggest, on Twitter, that impeaching Fairfax without also impeaching Northam and Herring would [amount to a racist double standard](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094610433435156486). (A Washington *Post*–Schar School poll conducted late last week found that support of Northam was notably [higher among black respondents than among white respondents](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginians-split-on-governors-fate-amid-blackface-scandal-poll-shows/2019/02/09/93002e84-2bc1-11e9-b011-d8500644dc98_story.html?utm_term=.5feb2b44eadc), and was higher, even, than it was among just white Democrats. “[Black voters are exceptionally pragmatic,](https://twitter.com/DrTedJ/status/1094386265611530240)” a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice observed, on Twitter.)\n\n \n\nOne local observer described Northam, Fairfax, and Herring to me as “three linked mountaineers in a single fall.” But others have tried to make careful distinctions among the various allegations. Katie Cristol, a member of the Arlington County Board, has worked with Northam—she mentioned the recruitment of Amazon’s second headquarters to the region as one example—and described Fairfax as a friend. But she has called on both to resign. “We have an agenda that is about equity and anti-racist goals, and I don’t think he can effectively lead on it,” she said, referring to the governor. As for Fairfax, she said, she had thought, after the first allegation, that “there might be a way forward for him to recognize harm done” and stay in office. After the second, it seemed clear to her that there was an indefensible pattern of behavior. “There’s no path forward for him to continue as lieutenant governor,” she told me. (Two of Fairfax’s key staffers have since resigned, including the policy director Adele McClure, who, according to a source close to her, had been planning to “stick by the lieutenant governor” after the first allegation, believing that “there would be evidence that would ultimately clear his name.” )\n\nCristol thinks Herring can stay, though. “I’m cognizant of my own lack of authority on the matter as a white person,” she said. “But I do believe that it’s different than dressing up in a symbol of hate and terror. And I also believe that his comments reflected a real level of self-awareness, self-scrutiny, and an understanding of why what he did was so hurtful, even if he didn’t understand at the time.”\n\n \n\nCristol considers herself part of “a new Democratic party in Virginia” that’s emerged over the past two years. Virginia recently “elected the first transgender state delegate,” she noted, and “sent the first two Latinas to the state house. A former refugee, too.” She went on, “It just felt like this extraordinary run, where the Virginia that I lived in finally reflected the Virginia that I believed we could be.” She sighed. “And now, to be thrown back to the worst tendencies of the Commonwealth’s racism and its culture of sexual assault is devastating.”\n\n \n\nThe senior Democrat I spoke to on Friday is an African-American man; he has worked on both state and national Democratic campaigns for more than a decade. He has avoided making public or private declarations of support for the governor, even among his family, he said. But he spoke highly of him to me. “To be completely honest, I don’t think Ralph Northam is a racist,” he said. He continued, “You look back at what he’s done in his life and in his career. Obviously, there’s some stuff that’s not helpful in there—whether it be the Michael Jackson stuff or something else.” But, he said, Northam’s career as a pediatric neurologist, during which he cared for poor and minority patients who were sometimes unable to pay, is to his credit—and when Northam ran for office, the Democrat continued, “he had an affinity for the Chesapeake Bay, which he saw deteriorating, and he didn’t like the way insurance companies were treating his patients, who mostly look like me.” This painted the picture of someone who wouldn’t wear blackface or a Klan robe. “I just didn’t think it was him,” the Democrat said, of the yearbook photo. (He did not offer any words of support for Fairfax.) \n\n \n\nLast Friday, after our first phone call, the Democrat called his mother. “I got off a five-minute phone call with her, our first talk that long in a week, and I had forty-five text messages,” he said. While they were on the phone, the second Fairfax accuser had come forward. Speaking of his fellow Party members, he said, “We’ve had conversations about what happens, if the governor resigns and what happens if he doesn’t. There are thoughts about how to move forward, but no one has concrete thoughts.” The Party’s governing body has a scheduled meeting in two weeks, he said, “where I think those conversations will take more shape.”\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cc341e4c73c088d77e5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1cc341e4c73c088d77e5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Virginia","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"virginia"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Virginia","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"virginia"},{"id":"5c2e1c7936cecf40192141cc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7936cecf40192141cc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Democratic

Governor Ralph Northam, of Virginia, said on Saturday, in a press conference that exhibited a stunning lack of self-awareness, all the more apparent because of Northam’s insistence that he knew exactly who he was. The photograph in question was in his 1984 Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook, and it appeared, as he conceded, “with others I submitted, on a page with my name on it.” One of the people wore blackface and a costume—plaid pants, a bow tie, a puffy wig, and a tilted porkpie hat—that added to the crudeness and the cruelty of the racist caricature; the other person was in a hooded Ku Klux Klan uniform, which added a threat of violence. Both are holding what look like beer cans, as Northam is in another photograph in the spread that is clearly of him. (His yearbook quote: “There are more old drunks than old doctors in this world so I think I’ll have another beer.”) On Friday, hours after a conservative Web site had published—and others had quickly confirmed—the existence of the page, Northam, who is a Democrat, had apologized “for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo.” His press conference the next day was a reversal, in which he repeated a variation on the same line more than a dozen times: “I am not either of the people in the photo”; “I am not the person in that photo”; “That is not my person in that picture”; “I truly do not believe that I am in the picture”; and, almost existentially, “The picture is not me.”\n\nThe one useful aspect of Northam’s repetition of the “not me” line is that it provides a rough index of some of the ways in which the press conference was insulting, beginning with this one: “I think all of you will be reassured to see that I am not in that photograph.” The identity of the people in the photograph, which Northam thought “facial recognition” technology might help pin down, is only part of the problem, though. Including that picture in the yearbook was itself an act of publicizing and magnifying hate, regardless of whether Northam was one of the people in it. Northam, on Saturday, claimed that he had somehow never even seen the photo before, that he didn’t buy the yearbook, and that some mix-up in the yearbook office—“a number of photos laid out on a table and someone is pasting those on page after page”—must have led to its inclusion. He said that he’d been told of such mistakes occurring. He added, “I recognize that many people will find this difficult to believe,” and yet he expected them to do so. The scenario is, indeed, improbable. Nor did it help that Northam repeatedly confined the larger problem of the photo to the simple question of who was in it, as when he said, at another point in the press conference,  “What caused this stir-up yesterday, I am not responsible for. That is not me in that photo.” And there are other questions: Did no one mention the image to him when the yearbook came out? Did it make sense to his classmates that he would represent himself that way? And how could he believe that a story involving such a chain of cosmic coincidences would “reassure” anyone?\n\nNortham did say, on Saturday, that he had “darkened” his face as part of a Michael Jackson costume for a dance contest held in San Antonio, Texas, in 1984, when he was an Army officer. This prompted another version of the not-me line: “It is because my memory of that episode is so vivid that I truly do not believe I am in the picture in my yearbook.” He apologized for that but, again, seemed to find the whole incident exculpatory—a lesser sin that deflected from the more damaging one. The blackface M.J. was bad, he conceded, but still a “contrast” to the image in the yearbook, in part because of the presence of the man in the Klan outfit. One open question, beyond the baseline of blackface awfulness, is the extent to which Northam used Jackson as a vehicle for making a mockery of blackness itself. It is a bad sign that Northam remembers applying, as a skin darkener, not foundation or powder or even grease paint but shoe polish. Or, as he put it, “just a little bit of shoe polish to put under my, or on my cheeks, and the reason I used a very little bit is because, I don’t know if anybody’s ever tried that, you cannot get shoe polish off.”\n\nNo one in the press conference volunteered having tried it. Where was Northam getting his shoe-polish advice in 1984? Northam, as a politician, has been known for making an effort to connect to and represent Virginia’s African-American community. He made a point of visiting predominantly black churches during his campaign (the pastor of his own church is African-American, and accompanied him to the press conference) and has championed issues that are important to the community, such as voting rights, and strongly condemned the white-supremacist violence in Charlottesville in 2017\\. And yet it was not until his 2017 campaign for governor, he said, that a conversation with a black member of his staff triggered in him the realization that there might have been a problem with the whole Michael Jackson episode. He said in the press conference that he had won the dance contest; there was a moment in which he’d seemed ready to moonwalk for the reporters present, until his wife interjected, saying, “inappropriate circumstances.” Who did he think his audience was when he said, remembering his youth on Virginia’s Eastern Shore, “I suspect I’ve had as much exposure to people of color as anybody”?\n\nAmong those not reassured were the Virginia legislature’s black caucus and various civil-rights groups, including the N.A.A.C.P., who, along with a raft of senior Democratic politicians, have called on Northam to resign, which he’d refused to do. (If he does, he will be replaced by the lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax, who is African-American.) One reporter asked Northam if he ought to resign out of respect for their views. His reply amounted to a suggestion that, if African-American leaders just paid attention to what he was saying, they would come around: “I really think, if they will listen to me—again, I hate to be so redundant, but for them to know that this was not me in that picture,” he said. “That was not Ralph Northam. And I hope that they will accept that and I hope that they will take my word.” Northam does not seem to realize that tending to his credibility is really not their job.  \n\nA question that reporters kept returning to was why Northam had initially said that he was in the photograph if, as he said later, his first, horrified reaction was, “This can’t be me.” Was it, as one reporter put it, part of a “life style”? Northam was particularly incoherent on this point. In part, he blamed the hubbub of phone calls from reporters and people who were deeply hurt. (Last week, he’d also caused hurt with comments about very late-term abortions, which made it sound as if Northam, who is a pediatric neurologist, were offering a scenario for facilitating the death of a severely disabled newborn; he said that his remarks were “mischaracterized.”) He did say he always knew that he wasn’t the man in the Klan uniform, although his initial apology hadn’t been specific about that. But he also admitted that he hadn’t, at first, been quite so sure about the man in blackface, given that the photo was on his page. “I didn’t know at the time”; in the rush, “I didn’t study it as well as I should”; “Last night, I finally had a chance to sit down and look at the photograph in detail. It is definitely not me. I can tell by looking at it.”\n\nHe added, “It has taken time for me to make sure that it is not me.” It has taken, perhaps, thirty-five years. Northam might have done better to forthrightly say that the Northam of today would never have appeared in, chosen, or countenanced such an image without insisting at that late point that he was absolutely certain that no version of Ralph Northam ever did. Early in his press conference, Northam read a prepared statement in which he said, “In some ways, my personal history mirrors that of this Commonwealth. There are actions and behaviors in my past that were hurtful, but, like Virginia, I have also made significant progress in how I approach these issues.” But by the time he stepped off the stage he had, unfortunately, left the impression that he still could not fully see himself in the picture of Virginia’s—and America’s—history of racism. That failure alone is grave enough, and  facial-recognition technologies won’t do much to ameliorate it. Nor will Northam’s belief in the power of his own image of himself to define and excuse him. “I am convinced that is not my picture,” he said. “That is not who I am.”\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e824a08312cd3aa6e18","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ralph Northam","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ralph-northam"},{"id":"5c2e1cc341e4c73c088d77e5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Virginia","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"virginia"},{"id":"5c2e1f37ee7fe02cbd1635a0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Blackface","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"blackface"},{"id":"5c2e1c7bb75f002c8941e471","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Racism","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"racism"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a01ff019dfc3494ea4158","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Amy Davidson Sorkin became a staff writer in 2014.

Northam immediately apologized for appearing in the photo, but he then changed his story and said that neither person in the photograph was him; he did, however, say that he had once put shoe polish on his face as part of a Michael Jackson costume. By the end of the weekend, many members of the Virginia and national Democratic parties had called for Northam’s resignation.\n\nTo discuss the subject of blackface and its historical role in American politics, culture, and racism, I spoke by phone with Eric Lott, who teaches American studies at the *CUNY*{: .small} Graduate Center and is the author of  “[Love & Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy & the American Working Class](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Theft-Blackface-Minstrelsy-American/dp/0195320557).” An edited and condensed version of our conversation is below.\n\n__What did you think when you saw the photograph?__\n\nHere we go again. [Blackface] never seems to die as a collegiate, fraternity activity, which follows on decades of local performances of various kinds, Kiwanis Clubs and Rotary Clubs, which follows on the very long history of both Hollywood and vaudeville stage performance going back into the early nineteenth century. \n\n__The photo was obviously offensive and awful, but it was also weird if you don’t know this culture. There is a guy in blackface and a guy in a Klan hood. What’s the joke they are going for?__\n\nI know. I was trying to puzzle that out because that really is—to situate it in full context, with the paired costumes—an interesting thing to try and figure out, over and above the embrace of the blackface guise. And there is more than one of those, too.\n\n__What do you mean by that?__\n\nThere are various types of blackface characters one could adopt. I gather there is a Michael Jackson outfit lurking somewhere in his closet, but that is not what this is. Although it’s not far from it. There is a bow tie. There is a jacket. It’s kind of dandyish, speaking of one of the prototypes from the minstrel show, the Zip Coon figure. I think it is very interesting that this is a very particular kind of costume. But paired with the Klan outfit, as though they belong together. Lest there be any murkiness about it, it is just two versions of white supremacy, one in blackface and one not. But there is some kind of gesture that would seem to remove the twenty-five-year-olds doing it from the history they are impersonating, in which a black person summons forth that person’s white-supremacist counterpart or policer or enforcer. I sense in the costume an avowal that they are part of this history, but also an attempt to lampoon it, as though it is not them, it’s these figures not of their time, or something like that.\n\n__Is pairing these things together something that you see in the iconography of blackface?__\n\nYeah, at Halloween- and fraternity-party-type things you will find a Klan person with a noose around a person in blackface’s neck. A scripted scenario in which a racist is assaulting a black American, both of them played by whites. The psychic sources of wanting to replay that scenario is anyone’s guess.\n\n__Can you talk more about the different types of blackface we have seen throughout history, and what regional and class differences there are?__\n\nThe prototypical ones were launched in the eighteen-forties and eighteen-fifties in blackface performance, in the minstrel-show proper, which was mostly a Northern, urban phenomenon, although it had offshoots and variations everywhere, out in the West, the Northwest, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, the current Midwest. There were versions in the South, as well. Those are solo or duo performances. But for several decades the full-blown performance was five or so performers onstage, with various instrumentation and characters. \n\nBut the two archetypes of blackface are separated by geography and class. One is the Northern dandy, Zip Coon. The Zip Coon character is dandified, probably being lampooned for assuming airs and intellect beyond his station. And the Southern plantation African-American type, Jim Crow, from which the system of legal segregation took its name, later in the century, is the happy-go-lucky, somewhat mischievous, enslaved person down South. Both these characters, Zip Coon and Jim Crow, had songs named after them. And variants on those and combinations of their features show up later in vaudeville and film and Halloween parties and Halloween characters. When people did Obama in blackface, it is very much a play on Zip Coon and dandified blackface characters. And this particular one seems to have come out of that tradition.\n\n__Were the timeframes that these two archetypes showed up in the same?__\n\nThey were simultaneous. In the eighteen-forties they come into clarity. By the eighteen-sixties, after the Civil War, there are changes to the business of blackface performance. African-American performers themselves get into the game, and those types begin to shift, so that by the time of the “coon show” proper, which is more eighteen-nineties, where you have black performers themselves in blackface, you have really urban, knife-wielding hustler types, and also the rural chicken-thief type. But those first two, in the eighteen-forties and eighteen-fifties, really set the terms for later variations. \n\n__Klan iconography and people who are not in the Klan wearing Klan outfits: How does that history mirror or differentiate itself from people using blackface?__\n\nBoth of them are initially and by definition theatrical guises. The Klan outfit is this over-the-top, theatricalized, performative setup in which you have these gowns and robes. It is ritualized, certainly, but there is a weird investment in costume, as there is in blackface. I don’t think it’s just a Southern thing. [Some] of the strongholds of the Klan were places like Northern Indiana and Michigan. The way in which race and thinking about race, signifiers of race, open immediately onto theatricalizing of race, performance of it, by crossing over to put on blackface. You can’t just go around being white. You have to put on this robe and you have to demonstrate and insist on your whiteness by, oddly, covering it up. They all just metastasize into crazier and crazier sorts of suggestions about what race means to white people in the United States.\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\n__We do that by electing people, too.__\n\nExactly. I have just been reading the recent Donald Trump [tanning reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/us/politics/trump-tan.html), and he invests a fair amount of time, it appears, in his own costume, his own hair and skin treatment, which is, you know, not unrelated to all this. It is just a different kind of, at some level, racialized performance of fame, whiteness, Presidentialness.\n\n__He was doing this before he became President, but, yeah.__ \n\nThat’s right.\n\n__Is there anything you would like to hear Northam say that you think would be helpful for people trying to understand this?__\n\nI think he has already said it, with the masks. I don’t think there is anything he could say that would be more eloquent than what he did say with the mask, which was a kind of speech about his racial feeling, his self-sense of his whiteness, his sense of his relation to the color line between black and white. And any attempt to read his own act of racialized speech would fall short of what he has already said. In terms of his own analysis, I am not expecting much.

When a photograph that appeared on Northam’s 1984 medical-school yearbook page surfaced last week, depicting a person in Ku Klux Klan robes standing next to a person in blackface, [demands for the governor’s resignation](https://www.vox.com/2019/2/3/18209320/virginia-gov-ralph-northam-resignation) came in rapid succession. The outrage, like arson, could be identified by its multiple points of origin. Progressives lamented that Northam had been a consensus candidate whom they had settled on, during the 2017 campaign, only after their preferred choice, Tom Perriello, a former U.S. representative, lost to him in the Democratic primary. If the photograph had emerged back then, they reasoned, it would have tilted the primary in a state where a fifth of the electorate is African-American. Conservatives, who in the Trump era seem to have installed spigots with hot and cold running indignation, seized on Northam as new evidence in their running argument that the [Democrats are the real racists](https://thinkprogress.org/fox-news-sean-hannity-ralph-northam-racism-republicans-democrats-abraham-lincoln-civil-rights-act-4f85ed45efa4/ ). That claim required great sums of temerity, given that the Republican gubernatorial candidate in 2017, Ed Gillespie, ran an egregiously Trumpian campaign [defined by nativism](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/opinion/ed-gillespie-trump-virginia.html) and a defense of the [totems of the Confederacy](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/confederate-monuments-become-hot-button-issue-in-va-governors-race/). [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) had tweeted that Gillespie “might even save our great statues/heritage!”\n\nOthers were drawn to more strategic—and darkly satirical—concerns. Northam’s resignation would result in Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, an African-American, being elevated to the governorship. The prospect of Virginia’s second black governor, after Douglas Wilder, coming to power as a result of his white predecessor’s being caught, however long after the fact, in blackface or a Klan hood seems like a lost scene from “Putney Swope.” That calculation became more vexing when allegations surfaced over the weekend that Fairfax had sexually assaulted a woman in 2004. (Fairfax has denied the charges, saying that the encounter was consensual.) Then, on Wednesday, Mark Herring, the Virginia Attorney General and the third in the line of succession to the governorship, confessed that he, too, had worn blackface, when he and some friends went to a party “dressed like rappers,” in 1980, when he was a nineteen-year-old college student. (Herring had previously called for Northam’s resignation.) Reckonings with history, both personal and societal, seem to be ricocheting across the Commonwealth of Virginia. \n\nYet there were other reasons that warranted taking a pause before calling for Northam’s resignation. The governor ran on a [progressive platform](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/what-virginias-governor-elect-ralph-northam-d-promised-during-his-campaign/2017/11/23/a6a2dc4e-c992-11e7-8321-481fd63f174d_story.html) that included free community college, greater access to health care, criminal-justice reform, a fifteen-dollar-an-hour minimum wage, and a rollback of voter-suppression laws in the state. Every one of those things would have disproportionately benefitted the black residents of Virginia. The yearbook photograph is indisputably terrible. The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, a monument that commemorates the victims of lynching and racial terrorism in America, lists more than four thousand black people who lost their lives to recreational murder in the South. No person who has even the dimmest recognition of what happened to those victims could find humor in a Klansman’s robes. Yet the more salient question, one that could not be answered in the clamor for Northam’s immediate ejection, was how his moral sensibilities had evolved in the intervening three decades.\n\nThe odds are high that a fifty-nine-year-old white Southerner would have grown up in a climate of ambient racism. The odds are also high that such a person might never find reason to publicly renounce that past. There is, however, an important tradition of white Southerners—[Lillian Smith](https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Fruit-Lillian-Smith/dp/0156856360), [Harper Lee](https://www.amazon.com/Kill-Mockingbird-Harper-Lee/dp/0446310786), [Howell Raines](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01K0TFS3O), [Diane McWhorter](https://www.amazon.com/Carry-Home-Birmingham-Climactic-Revolution/dp/1476709513), and, more recently, Mitch Landrieu, the former mayor of New Orleans—publicly grappling with the racist legacy of the region and their own efforts to move beyond it to discover a broader recognition of humanity. (The late Robert Byrd, who served for more than fifty years as a senator from West Virginia, spoke openly about the wrongheadedness of his youthful membership in the Klan.) The example of Landrieu, a possible Presidential candidate in 2020, is particularly instructive. In 2017, he delivered a widely praised speech in which he not only called for the removal of racist monuments from city property in New Orleans but also explained the need to reject the warped view of history that had led to their erection in the first place. Northam’s situation was far more self-interested, but he nonetheless had, for a moment, space to address his prior actions in a way that might have at least been thought-provoking. But no. On Saturday, Northam held a press conference that was in equal measures bizarre and infuriating. After having apologized for appearing in the photograph—though he said he couldn’t remember which of the two men pictured he was—he backtracked, stating that he was *neither* the minstrel nor the Klansman, before confessing that he had, on another occasion, blackened his skin while taking part in a Michael Jackson dance contest. The problem, he implied, was not that he was being castigated for minstrelsy but that he was being castigated for the wrong instance of it. The governor’s wife had to all but physically restrain him from demonstrating his moonwalking skills.\n\nIt’s worth noting that, for all the fraught racial history in this country, there is no tradition of black college students gathering in drunken revels to perform chalk-faced imitations of white people. Or of feeling a need to whiten one’s skin on Halloween—because, otherwise, how would people recognize your Captain America or Daenerys Targaryen costume? The understanding is that the character that Chris Evans plays in “The Avengers” is named Captain America, not White Captain America.\n\nNortham, with his admission to the Jackson imitation, almost seemed to be pleading to a lesser charge, but it was in itself deeply strange and disturbing. (Herring seemed to acknowledge something like this in his admission of his own behavior, saying, “It was really a minimization of both people of color, and a minimization of a horrific history I knew well even then.”) Jackson was probably the most famous man in the world in the nineteen-eighties, and, as a consequence, his outfits became a sort of iconography. A man wearing, say, a black jacket, a sequinned white glove, and high-water pants with white socks was not going to be mistaken for George Michael or Phil Collins. The need to darken one’s skin to complete the look suggests that Jackson’s race was part of the costume, that the darkness of Jackson’s skin was essential to his persona as a pop star. This is, of course, the exact offense of minstrelsy, the pairing of persona with pigment, the suspicion that one’s essence is epidermal. In that regard, it’s irrelevant whether the imitation is performed out of derision or as homage; the same damning assumptions underlie both instances. \n\nNortham’s fiasco began on the first day of February, Black History Month. The celebration has its origins in the work of Dr. Carter G. Woodson, a historian who was born in 1875, in the state that Northam now governs. Woodson’s parents were born into slavery; he worked in coal mines, and did not begin full-time high-school studies until he was twenty years old. Yet he managed to earn an undergraduate degree from Berea College, in Kentucky, and a Ph.D. in history from Harvard, and to devote his life to using scholarship to assail the doctrine of white supremacy. In 1926, he founded Negro History Week, which was eventually expanded into Black History Month. In the most inept and absurd of ways, Northam demonstrated the ongoing relevance of Woodson’s idea. If the question at the beginning of the story was what had happened in the thirty-five years since that photograph appeared in Northam’s yearbook, the governor has delivered an unequivocal answer: not nearly enough.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e824a08312cd3aa6e18","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ralph Northam","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ralph-northam"},{"id":"5c2e1cc341e4c73c088d77e5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Virginia","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"virginia"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c9ab75f002c8941e4a5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Race","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"race"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590c957a4e65be2f29d55262","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jelani Cobb has been contributing to _The New Yorker_ since 2012, and became a staff writer in 2015.

During the Shah’s era, Iran’s diplomatic mission was [famed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/iranian-embassy-shuttered-for-decades-was-known-for-hedonistic-star-studded-gatherings/2013/12/08/3a537fe0-57a8-11e3-8304-caf30787c0a9_story.html?utm_term=.367b2630973d) for its White House connections and its hedonistic, caviar-infused parties, attended by the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Andy Warhol, and Barbara Walters, on Embassy Row. It closed after President Carter [broke off](http://usip.org/publications/2019/02/iran-analysis-1979-2019) relations, in 1980, a few months after students seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.\n\nSince then, Iran has relied on three dozen Iranians with green cards to conduct its business in the United States. The teetotalling revolutionaries operated for years out of a second-floor office, above a liquor store, far from the diplomatic quarter. They often complained about not being allowed enough telephone lines to cope with the consular needs of some three hundred thousand Iranian-passport holders living in the United States. As Iran negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal with the world’s six major powers, the Obama Administration [allowed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2015/05/08/iran-and-u-s-cut-deal-on-new-diplomatic-offices-in-washington-tehran/?utm_term=.ee9398eac03f) the Interest Section to move to classier digs—with more telephone lines—in Washington’s West End. It’s now a twenty-minute walk from the White House and on the same street as the State Department.\n\nAtefat, a tall, bearded man with graying hair, studied soil fertility at a university in Oklahoma, forty years ago, and stayed. At the dinner party, he wore a standup collar with no tie, a symbol of Western fashion banned since the 1979 revolution. In remarks, he bemoaned the renewed tensions between the U.S. and Iran, after [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) [abandoned](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-destroys-the-iran-dealand-a-lot-more) the nuclear deal, last May.\n\n“People had hoped that the peaceful and respectful resolution of the controversy would usher a new era and end the sanctions,” he told several dozen guests, who sipped juice and tea. Instead, he said, “A taller wall of mistrust has been erected. Unfortunately, we are experiencing another totally failed approach to Iran—[a] military option!”\n\nThe statements emanating from Tehran on Friday were darker and snarkier. “The U.S. regime is the embodiment of evil, violence, creating chaos, and warmongering,” the Iranian Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a speech to military officers. On his English-language Twitter account, Khamenei vowed that “the Iranian nation will not abandon ‘Death to America’.” He then clarified: “&nbsp;‘Down with USA’ means down with @realDonaldTrump, @AmbJohnBolton and @SecPompeo. It means death to the American politicians currently in power. It means death to the few people running that country; we have nothing against the American nation.”\n\nThat first generation of revolutionaries is still paranoid about U.S. intentions, which is one reason Iran to lock up Americans and dual nationals four decades after the seizure of the U.S. Embassy—and the introduction of modern hostage-taking, when fifty-two diplomats and citizens were held for four hundred and forty-four days. At least four Americans are currently being held captive in Iran, including Siamak Namazi, a businessman; Xiyue Wang, a Princeton graduate student; and Michael White, a Navy veteran from California. [Robert A. Levinson](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/world/middleeast/iran-robert-levinson-lawsuit.html?module=inline), a former F.B.I. agent, has been missing since he disappeared in Iran in 2007.\n\nThe Trump Administration acknowledged the revolution’s longevity with its own insults. “Even your president, Hassan Rouhani, admits to the Iranian regime’s 40 years of failure,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo [tweeted](https://twitter.com/SecPompeo/status/1091147984996388865) recently, in both English and Farsi. “Your ruling regime has always prioritized ideology over the interests and well-being of the Iranian people.”\n\nOn paper, Iran—a petrostate with vast reserves of oil and natural gas—should be a member of the G-20, a group of the world’s richest industrialized nations. Its eighty-one million people are tech-savvy, innovative, and voracious consumers. One of the positive by-products of the revolution has been [soaring literacy](https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2019/feb/06/revolution-40-society-numbers) rates—from thirty-seven per cent in 1976 to eighty-six per cent in 2016, according to *UNESCO*{: .small}. That includes women, who are now the majority of students in Iranian universities.\n\nInstead, the Islamic Republic is [struggling](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/world/middleeast/iran-economy.html?module=inline). “Today, the country is facing the biggest pressure and economic sanctions in the past forty years,” President Rouhani warned in a speech, on January 30th, to mark the revolution’s anniversary. Seventy per cent of the Iranian public agree that economic conditions are bad, according to [a survey](https://www.iranpoll.com/publications/state2018) released on Saturday, by IranPoll, a Canada-based public-opinion research firm. Iran’s currency has plummeted by some seventy per cent in the past year. Inflation is estimated at thirty-five per cent. Unemployment is a chronic problem, especially among the educated youth born after the revolution, who now make up the majority of the population—and voting bloc.\n\nThe original revolutionaries, now nearly all senior citizens, blame Trump’s reimposition of sweeping sanctions last year for the country’s economic problems. A recent survey by IranPoll found that sixty per cent of Iranians instead blame gross government mismanagement and rampant corruption. A year ago, protests over unemployment, delayed pay, high prices, and deteriorating economic conditions [erupted](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-in-turmoil-to-trumps-delight) in most of Iran’s thirty-one provinces. Today, they remain the most volatile flash point challenging the regime’s durability.\n\nIn an interview in Qatar, in December, I asked the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to reflect on the revolution’s successes and failures. It was part of an ongoing conversation we’ve had for thirty-five years, since he was a young diplomat at the United Nations. “The most important success has been to give the people a voice in domestic and foreign affairs,” he said. “Our people believe—whether they agree with government policies or they don’t—that they have a say in their own future.”\n\nOn the revolution’s failures, Zarif mused, “If you compare the situation with what we had thought are our ideals, then we haven’t achieved much. But, if you compare the situation with the realities of the region today, then I think we’ve done pretty well. So it depends on what you compare it with. Obviously, we had much higher ideals both in terms of internal as well as external relations.”\n\nI asked Zarif what the ideal Islamic republic would look like. He said the goal had been “a form of government that combines two elements—Islam and republicanism. Islam and democracy.” The central tension inside the revolution has always been whether it is foremost about creating an Islamic state or a republic. Its constitution is modelled on French and Belgian law combined with Sharia law. Its secular government and religious oversight branches have long competed for power.\n\nIn most ways, the Supreme Leader, who has virtual veto capacity over actions by the President, Parliament, and judiciary, still has absolute power. But the clergy otherwise has a notably diminished role. In Iran’s first parliamentary election, in 1980, [sixty-one per cent](https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2019/feb/05/revolution-40-politics-numbers) of the seats were won by clerics. Today, they hold only six per cent of seats. Iran’s Parliament now has more female members—seventeen—than clerics.\n\n“The ideal society would have been a society where disparities would be minimal,” Zarif said. “And where Iran would be able to make strides in terms of science and technology, based on the capabilities of its own people and working with the rest of the world.” He added, “We have made some achievements, but not to the extent that we had aspired.”\n\nThe question at this landmark juncture is how the next decade plays out. The United States is clearly trying to influence Iran’s future. When Pompeo was in Congress, he repeatedly called for regime change. So did John Bolton, before he became the national-security adviser last year. (For many years, Bolton was a spokesman for the Mujahideen-e-Khalq, a small Marxist-Islamist opposition cult that, [until 2012](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/22/world/middleeast/iranian-opposition-group-mek-wins-removal-from-us-terrorist-list.html), was on the U.S. list of designated terrorist groups, for killing U.S. officials.) Both Pompeo and Bolton now disavow that goal, claiming they only want to change Iran’s “behavior.” \n\nIn a speech last year, though, Pompeo outlined twelve sweeping [demands](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/mike-pompeo-speech-12-demands-iran-180521151737787.html) for Iran, including ending any role in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen; all support for Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Taliban; all missile development; and the detention of United States citizens and allies. Many amount to total reversals—policy change, if not total regime change. President Trump also recently [let slip](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-president-trump-on-face-the-nation-february-3-2019/) his plans to move U.S. troops from Syria into Iraq, to “watch” Iran. “Iran is a real problem,” he said, on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” on February 3rd. The strategic reality—and irony—is that Iran has widened its influence in the Middle East since the U.S. invasion of Iraq, in 2003, a moment when it looked like Iran might be the next American target. Tehran’s allies now dominate the government in Baghdad. Iraq bluntly rebuffed Trump’s assertion that U.S. troops should focus on Iran from its territory. “Don’t overburden Iraq with your own issues,” President Barham Salih, a Kurd, said last week. “Do not pursue your own policy priorities—we live here.” Iraq’s powerful Shiite cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, vetoed the notion that Iraq would become “the launching pad for harming any other country.” With the imminent withdrawal of U.S. troops in Syria, Trump also effectively cedes future leverage to Iran and Russia, whose arms, aid, and troops secured President Bashar al-Assad’s military victory and hold on power. Trump also remains intent on pulling U.S. troops out Afghanistan, which borders Iran to the east. A Taliban victory, or simply chaos, following a U.S withdrawal would further reduce Washington’s influence in the region and increase Iran’s.\n\nThe Administration is exploring other ways to pressure the Islamic Republic. On February 13th and 14th, Pompeo will co-host a conference, in Warsaw, on “stability and peace” in the Middle East. It’s widely seen as a U.S. attempt to build a formal [anti-Iran coalition](https://www.rferl.org/a/pompeo-says-us-to-hold-iran-focused-summit-in-february/29704025.html), in order to further squeeze Tehran economically, diplomatically, and in the region. Seventy nations from the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa have been invited.\n\nFor all the disgruntlement with their fraying revolution, Iranians may be little swayed by the Trump Administration. The new IranPoll found that eighty-two per cent said that they now have an unfavorable view of the United States, even as sixty per cent said they believe “the West and the Islamic world have similar needs and wants.” The White House has been counting on—and urging—Iranians to rise up. But there is little so far to indicate that the Islamic Republic won’t be celebrating its forty-first anniversary next year, at its Interest Section near the White House.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8841e4c73c088d777c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8841e4c73c088d777c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Iran","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"iran"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Iran","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"iran"},{"id":"5c2e1eea36cecf401921440a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1eea36cecf401921440a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Iranian

Only [ten per cent](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html) of Egypt’s hundred million people are Christian. “I keep a Bible open on my desk to remind me of God and His Word, and The Truth.” (The State Department transcript provided this capitalization.)\n\nThe main message of Pompeo’s speech in Egypt—which was the major event of a nine-nation tour of the Middle East—was that the Obama Administration had made the devil’s choices in the world’s most volatile region. In 2009, President Barack Obama gave a speech in the same city, in which he spoke of a “new beginning” for U.S. policy. Without using Obama’s name, Pompeo charged that the former President was responsible for the region’s woes. “Our leaders gravely misread our history, and your historical moment,” in ways that “adversely affected” hundreds of millions of people in Egypt and across the region, he said. “In falsely seeing ourselves as a force for what ails the Middle East, we were timid about asserting ourselves when the times—and our partners—demanded it.” Under the Trump Administration, Pompeo claimed, America has “rediscovered its voice” and will now be “a force for good” in the Middle East. “The age of self-inflicted American shame is over, and so are the policies that produced so much unneeded suffering,” he said. “Now comes the real new beginning.”\n\nYet Pompeo’s speech coincides with chaos and contradictions in U.S. policy, reflected in the gyrating pronouncements that the Trump Administration has made about Syria in the past month and its split, last year, with its allies over the nuclear deal with Iran. In recent weeks, the Administration has also defied global fury to facilitate the rehabilitation of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, [Mohammed bin Salman](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mohammed-bin-salman), whom U.S. intelligence agencies and a unanimous Senate resolution hold accountable for the grisly murder of the Washington *Post* columnist [Jamal Khashoggi](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jamal-khashoggi), in Istanbul, in October.\n\nIn one of his most curious contradictions, Pompeo pledged that the United States “will not retreat until the terror fight is over.” The Trump Administration has “learned that when America retreats, chaos often follows. When we neglect our friends, resentment builds,” he said. It was a clear dig at the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, in 2011, which had in fact been set in motion by President George W. Bush’s agreement with Iraq in 2008. Last month, Trump, somewhat impulsively—after a conversation with the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan—ordered the withdrawal of two thousand U.S. troops from Syria. The move is widely viewed in the Middle East as a retreat that could neglect friends and trigger resentment. Pompeo claimed that the withdrawal did not signal a change in mission, although senior officials in both the Pentagon and the State Department believe otherwise.\n\nSince 2015, U.S. Special Forces have been critical in providing strategic guidance, arms, and intelligence to the Syrian Democratic Forces fighting *ISIS*{:.small} in Syria. The American presence has also created the space for the S.D.F. to establish areas that Syrian, Russian, Iranian, Hezbollah, and Turkish forces in Syria have not seriously contested for fear of stoking an open conflict with the United States. The S.D.F.—the single most important force in the offensive that reclaimed ninety-nine per cent of *ISIS*{:.small}’s former caliphate in Syria—will be left vulnerable to any or all of the other forces once the U.S. pulls out.\n\nOne of the major subjects of Pompeo’s speech, which took place at the American University in Cairo, was Iran. The Islamic Republic is set to mark the fortieth anniversary of its revolution next month, and Pompeo vowed that punitive actions against Tehran would become more severe “until Iran starts behaving like a normal country.” The members of the international community “increasingly understand that we must confront the ayatollahs, not coddle them,” he said, a reference to the nuclear deal between Iran and the world’s six major powers, which was reached in 2015. Trump withdrew the United States, last year, and re-imposed economic sanctions, even though all five other signatories—Britain, China, France, Germany, and Russia—continue to honor the deal.\n\nPompeo went so far as to pledge that the United States would “expel every last Iranian boot” from Syria. But the withdrawal of American troops will cost Washington even the modicum of leverage it still has in countering either Iran or Russia, whose military forces, strategic guidance, and aid have helped President Bashar al-Assad reassert control over all the major cities in Syria. Iran will likely be able to insure, and even deepen, its leverage in Syria, many regional experts told me.\n\nMissing from the speech was any reference to protecting human rights or democracy, initiating economic reforms to deal with chronic unemployment, or opening up society to address the hardships that triggered the Arab uprisings in 2011. Since the military coup, in 2013, which installed the current government, Egypt has arrested or charged at least sixty thousand people, forcibly disappeared hundreds for months at a time, handed down preliminary death sentences, and tried thousands of civilians in military courts, [according](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/06/egypt-torture-epidemic-may-be-crime-against-humanity) to Human Rights Watch. Trump has only deepened ties with Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, the former field marshal who led the coup, who is now the country’s President.\n\nPompeo “simply doubled-down on blanket U.S. support for the authoritarian regimes that have driven decades of instability in the Middle East,” Brian Dooley, a senior adviser at Human Rights First, said in a statement. “He said nothing about how Sisi is about to change the constitution and to try and install himself as president for life. He said nothing about how the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen has repeatedly violated international law and is driving the worst humanitarian crisis in decades.”  \n\nPompeo’s speech had three dimensions: it was anti-Obama, anti-Iran, and in favor of so-called traditional allies, as Robert Malley, the president of the International Crisis Group and a senior National Security Council staffer in the Obama Administration, told me. “The first reflects a politicization of foreign policy for which it is hard to conjure up a precedent. The second an ideological obsession that does not comport with reality. And the third an implicit celebration of an autocratic status quo that masquerades as a tribute to stability. Pompeo’s self-proclaimed message was that America is a force for good.  Whether that ever was the case, his speech was proof that, today at least, it plainly is not.”\n\nPompeo’s tour of the Middle East reflects the fragility of U.S. foreign policy under President Trump. Two years into taking office, the Administration still does not have [Ambassadors](http://www.afsa.org/list-ambassadorial-appointments) in six of the countries that Pompeo visited—Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. It also does not have Ambassadors in three other nations in the region—Morocco, Libya, and Syria.\n\nOn top of the vacancies, about a quarter of State Department employees are now reportedly furloughed by the government shutdown. Some of those involved in Pompeo’s travels are reportedly not receiving paychecks even as they travel the globe for the President.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cb4b75f002c8941e4c5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Egypt","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"egypt"},{"id":"5c2e1c8b2710c62d1081542e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Middle East","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"middle-east"},{"id":"5c2e1e357e716b454591af7b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"U.S. Foreign Policy","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"us-foreign-policy"},{"id":"5c2e1d714a08312cd3aa6d2a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mike Pompeo","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mike-pompeo"},{"id":"5c2e1c7d41c92e2c9b85da22","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Trump Administration","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"trump-administration"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

It was little noticed at the time. The readout from the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, on December 14th, was typical blah-blah diplomat-speak: the two Presidents had discussed “bilateral issues,” including “security concerns” in Syria and “the fight against terrorism.” News was so sparse that the on-duty pool reporter, Hunter Walker, of Yahoo, supplemented his e-mail to White House colleagues with a note that, “There is a lot of dessert left over in the White House basement.” The White House provided nary a hint that a monumental change in U.S. foreign policy was afoot—partly because so few knew.\n\n \n\nFive days later, after Trump tweeted his abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, top officials in his own Administration—and dozens of countries in the U.S.-led coalition against *ISIS*{: .small}—scrambled to piece together what had happened. There had been no interagency review, an often-prolonged process that methodically develops options from which the President picks. There had been no major deliberations with allies. Trump had long vowed to bring American forces home, but, just days earlier, the Pentagon and the State Department had publicly pronounced that the mission in Syria was far from accomplished. The call with Erdoğan, which lasted about a half hour, turned out to be the pivot, according to a well-placed U.S. official. \n\n \n\nThe conversation, through interpreters, was organized so that Trump could reinforce a warning that Turkey should not move militarily into the northeast quadrant of Syria, where U.S.-backed forces were still clearing out thousands of *ISIS*{: .small} fighters. Erdoğan has been threatening strikes on a Kurdish militia that is the backbone of the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is [armed](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/world/middleeast/us-begins-arming-syrian-kurds-for-final-assault-on-raqqa.html), aided, and advised by U.S. troops. Two days earlier, the Pentagon had [declared](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey-pentagon/unilateral-military-action-into-northeast-syria-unacceptable-pentagon-idUSKBN1OB2WC) that any military action near U.S. personnel, whatever the intent, was “unacceptable.”\n\n \n\nErdoğan turned the tables on Trump. He asked why Washington still had two thousand troops in Syria when the Islamic State’s caliphate had collapsed. It’s our neighborhood, he told Trump. Turkey could eradicate the remnants of *ISIS*{: .small} and help stabilize Syria. There’s no longer reason for the U.S. to be there, he said, but pledged to coördinate with the United States. Erdoğan laid it out in a way that made sense to the President, the source told me.\n\n \n\nThe White House tried to downplay the call. “The President merely informed his Turkish counterpart about his decision,” a senior Administration official told reporters on Wednesday. “It was not something he discussed with President Erdoğan.” But, on Friday, Erdoğan said publicly that Trump had decided to withdraw after Turkey promised to finish the job in Syria. “We will be working on our operational plans to eliminate *ISIS*{: .small} elements, which are said to remain intact in Syria, in line with our conversation with President Trump,” the Turkish leader said, in a speech in Istanbul. If the Erdoğan call had not happened on Friday, the U.S. official told me, the announcement to withdraw would not have been made on Wednesday.\n\n \n\nPerhaps coincidentally, or perhaps not, on Tuesday, the State Department [approved](https://apnews.com/583a18db0cd340a1a553c64ff9a47ef9) the sale of Patriot missile systems—worth three and a half billion dollars—to Turkey. Frustrated at the slow progress on its long-standing request for Patriots, Erdoğan’s government had turned to Russia to buy its S-400 missiles. The United States and Turkey’s other partners in *NATO*{: .small} had opposed the Russia arms deal. Now the U.S. transaction is back on track.\n\n \n\nThe Erdoğan call may not have gone as the President originally intended, but it precipitated an action that he has long wanted to take: to get out of foreign military hot spots. As he marks two years in office, Trump is doing what he promised in the campaign. On Thursday, Trump ordered half of the U.S. troops in Afghanistan to start pulling out—the second order to withdraw from a long-standing commitment in two days—which also stunned top U.S. officials. At seventeen years, Afghanistan is America’s longest war.\n\n \n\nAs with Syria, the decision was made before the full defeat of a jihadi-extremist enemy. It also undermined U.S. leverage in negotiating a political deal between the Afghan government and the Taliban to insure that the thousands of American lives and hundreds of billions of dollars expended after 9/11 were not wasted. In both Syria and Afghanistan, Trump undercut both his own special envoys—[Jim Jeffrey](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/press-room/view/jeffrey-appointed-pompeos-syria-advisor) for Syria (who was only appointed in August) and [Zalmay Khalilzad](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/05/641094135/zalmay-khalilzad-appointed-as-u-s-special-adviser-to-afghanistan) in Afghanistan (who was named in September)—just as they were building diplomatic momentum.\n\n \n\nTrump’s twin withdrawals have sweeping implications—beginning with the equally abrupt announcement that Defense Secretary James Mattis, the most respected member of the President’s Cabinet, was resigning in protest. “They emphasize that this Administration is hardly one that a country can make a deal with, that it has no unity of purpose, and that you don’t know who you’re talking to,” Paul Salem, the president of the Middle East Institute, told me. Across the Middle East and neighboring South Asia, governments are now worried about a resurgence of Sunni extremists in *ISIS*{: .small}, Al Qaeda, and the Taliban. Hezbollah, a militant Shiite movement, has effectively now become a regional power by helping President Bashar al-Assad win in Syria. Even a minimal U.S. military presence offered psychological and political leverage in the great and small power rivalries that riddle the Middle East.\n\n \n\nTrump’s broader agenda in the region is undermined, former senior diplomats said. “Trump’s decision to withdraw from Syria has dealt a strategic blow to Israel’s national security,” Martin Indyk, a former U.S. Ambassador to Israel, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Martin_Indyk/status/1075500091711074305). “Wait, Wasn’t he supposed to be the most pro-Israel president in history?” In a storm of tweets, Trump defended his decisions. “Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting *NOTHING*{: .small} but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing?” he [wrote](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1075721703421042688), on Thursday. “Do we want to be there forever? Time for others to finally fight….Russia, Iran, Syria & many others are not happy about the U.S. leaving, despite what the Fake News says, because now they will have to fight *ISIS*{: .small} and others, who they hate, without us.”\n\n \n\nThe timing of the two withdrawals may have been unexpected, but the decisions reflect the diminishing—critics claim unravelling—U.S. commitment in the Middle East and neighboring South Asia. “The region is still important, but not as critically important to us as it was ten or fifteen or twenty years ago,” Jeffrey Feltman, a former U.S. Ambassador and Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, told me. “Arab-Israeli issues used to be at the top of our agenda but aren’t anymore. The Egyptian relationship with Israel would continue whether the U.S. is there or not. We still have military stuff all over the place—Special Forces in Iraq and Yemen, a long military relationship with Jordan. We want preferential access to the Suez Canal. But it’s not a major footprint anymore.”\n\n \n\nTrump has his own reasons for downsizing. But the balance of power—in a region where the United States had the strongest influence for a half century—has actually been recalibrating since the end of the Bush Administration, a decade ago. In 2008, five years into the Iraq War, President George W. Bush signed an [agreement](https://www.factcheck.org/2015/08/bush-clinton-play-blame-game-in-iraq/) to pull out U.S. forces. President Obama only went back into Iraq in 2014, after the rise of *ISIS*{: .small}. During the campaign, Trump said that he would never have gone into Iraq (although, in 2002, he made comments on Howard Stern’s radio show in support of the war) and that he kept U.S. troops in Syria because they were already there. The outside world, especially America’s allies, have seen it coming, gradually but clearly.\n\n \n\nThe troubled history of the U.S. presence in the Middle East and South Asia is the wider subtext: misunderstanding Iran and missing the scope of hatred for the shah in the seventies; misreading the rise of political Islam and policies that mobilized the first modern suicide bombers against American targets in the eighties; abandoning Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal, which allowed the Taliban to seize power in the nineties; the invasion of Iraq in the early twenty-first century, followed by a withdrawal that facilitated *ISIS*{: .small} sweeping across Iraq and Syria in 2014\\.\n\n \n\n“I had earlier thought we needed to stay in Syria,” Ryan Crocker, the former U.S. Ambassador in both Syria and Afghanistan, told me. “But, over the last six months, I’ve come to the conclusion that we’re not good enough and not smart enough to play the post-conflict game with our troops on the ground.” He pointed to the eighteen hundred U.S. Marines in Beirut—about the same size as the force today in Syria—dispatched as a [peacekeeping force](https://www.cnn.com/2013/06/13/world/meast/beirut-marine-barracks-bombing-fast-facts/index.html) after the Israeli invasion, in 1982\\. They ended up getting enmeshed in the civil war. A suicide truck bomber killed more than two hundred and forty Americans, to this day the largest loss of Marines in a single incident since Iwo Jima, during the Second World War.\n\n \n\n“Who were the dominant players in Beirut then? Iran and Syria and their proxies,” Crocker, who was based in Beirut when the Marines were there, said. “Who are the dominant players in Syria today? Iran, Russia and their proxies. We are just not positioned to win. If we go or if we stay, it won’t affect the outcome very much. If we stay, then we become a player in a post-conflict, six-dimensional game that we have no clue of what the rules are. What is it that we think a couple thousand troops configured to fight *ISIS*{: .small} can do post-conflict?”\n\n \n\nThe wisdom of Trump’s dual decisions to withdraw will probably be debated for decades. So will the core question of what the role of the United States should be in the world’s most volatile region—and, specifically, what actually works.\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7981ab3335f580f166","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Syria","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"syria"},{"id":"5c2e1c7aee7fe02cbd16332d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Afghanistan","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"afghanistan"},{"id":"5c2e1c7d81ab3335f580f174","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Foreign Policy","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"foreign-policy"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c7d41c92e2c9b85da22","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Trump Administration","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"trump-administration"},{"id":"5c2e1c7d41c92e2c9b85da23","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Turkey","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"turkey"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

Simultaneously, the House Committee on Natural Resources held its own climate-change hearing—its first since 2009. With the Democrats back in power, everyone was suddenly elbowing for their patch of the long-desiccated turf. “We need to identify the practical ways to stop climate change,” Representative Scott Peters, a Democrat from California, said. “Whether it’s deregulation in hydropower, putting a price on carbon, carbon capture, research and development—feasible is not a euphemism for lack of ambition. But we have to do this in a bipartisan way. If not, it won’t pass, and it won’t last.” The committee chairman, Frank Pallone, a Democrat from New Jersey, also emphasized the need for bipartisan backing. “In New Jersey, there’s all kinds of pipelines being built, and different people are for it or against it.” He suggested that repairing and replacing old, leaky, and dangerous natural-gas pipelines was one area where there should be consensus support, “not only because of the pollution they can save but also because it leads to high-quality job creation.” \n\nWhile the hearings signalled some degree of new momentum, the repeated calls for bipartisanship were telling. The Democratic leadership seemed willing to go only so far in advancing climate talks on Capitol Hill. On Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released the names of the new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, which will have no legislative or subpoena power. (Pelosi created the committee in 2007, after she became the House Speaker, and Republicans disbanded it in 2011, when they regained control.) The chairwoman will be Kathy Castor, of Florida, who has a mostly unknown record, outside her district, for environmental and emissions-reduction policy. Forty-one of the House’s four hundred and thirty-five members have pledged “to not take contributions from the oil, gas, and coal industry, and instead prioritize the health of our families, climate, and democracy over fossil fuel industry profits.” But only one pledge-taker in that group, the freshman representative Mike Levin, from California, is on the new climate committee. The rest, as E&E News [reported](https://www.eenews.net/eedaily/2019/02/08/stories/1060120009), have fossil-fuel connections; during the 2018 election cycle, they or their political-action committees received two hundred and thirty-eight thousand dollars from the oil, gas, and electric-utilities industries, and many, including Castor, Representative Ben Ray Luján, of New Mexico, and Representative Suzanne Bonamici, of Oregon, also have investments in fossil-fuel assets.\n\nNotably not named to the committee was Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who arguably has played the biggest role in jump-starting the government’s renewed focus on climate change. (Pelosi did invite Ocasio-Cortez to serve on the panel, but she declined, citing “timing and logistics.”) Instead, Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, [introduced](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/with-the-green-new-deal-democrats-present-a-radical-proposition-for-combatting-climate-change) a much-hyped resolution for a Green New Deal. Ocasio-Cortez began to push the idea when she appeared, in November, at a sit-in in Pelosi’s office, which was led by the [Sunrise Movement](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-optimistic-activists-for-a-green-new-deal-inside-the-youth-led-singing-sunrise-movement), a group of teen-agers and college students calling for a hundred per cent renewable energy and an end to fossil-fuel money in politics. The Green New Deal resolution, a [non-binding document](https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov/sites/ocasio-cortez.house.gov/files/Resolution%20on%20a%20Green%20New%20Deal.pdf), outlines an ambitious plan for a “ten-year national mobilization” on “a scale not seen since World War II and the New Deal era.” The central goal is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions through funding and investments in community-led projects, repairs and upgrades to infrastructure, and a vast expansion in clean and renewable energy to meet a hundred per cent of national demand. Although conservatives have blasted the proposal as an impossible fantasy—a *Wall Street Journal* editorialist called it a “Dem parody bill”—the proposal dialled back some of the Sunrise Movement’s original demands, most notably by omitting a deadline for the complete phase-out of coal, oil, and gas, and by acknowledging the need for a fleet of energy sources, not only renewables but nuclear power and hydropower as well. In that regard, the resolution’s most substantive and granular clauses are not far-fetched but a statement of what’s feasible to avoid catastrophe.\n\nThe point of the declaration is to put increasing pressure on the Democratic Party, especially Presidential candidates, to treat climate change with the urgency it demands. Since the Sunrise Movement and Ocasio-Cortez first raised the idea, the Green New Deal has mostly functioned as a rallying cry with little actual substance. Thursday’s resolution provided the political manifesto, a first offer on what should be a top priority if Democrats take back the White House next year. For now, [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump), who did not mention climate change once during his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, is not going to sign a Green New Deal bill that looks anything like what Ocasio-Cortez and Markey laid out. But the House Democrats are taking other steps. In January, for example, they sent a letter to the Pentagon asking for a revised report on climate vulnerabilities, saying that the report the Department of Defense recently published did not address what Congress had requested: a list of the military installations most vulnerable to climate, and the costs of mitigating potential damages. \n\nAs the House deliberates an approach to climate policy, global conditions continue to deteriorate. Also on Wednesday morning, scientists from *NASA*{: .small} and *NOAA*{: .small}—two keepers of the world’s temperature and climate data—announced their analyses of 2018 trends. According to each of their independent conclusions, 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record since 1880. (2016 holds the record for warmest over all, followed by 2017 and 2015, which were nearly equal.) “The global temperature series resembles someone riding up an escalator over time, but jumping up and down while on that escalator,” Deke Arndt, the head of climate monitoring for *NOAA*{: .small}, said. In the Arctic, the rate of warming was between two and three times faster than the global mean, and, at both poles, Greenland and Antarctica lost mass from their ice sheets, contributing to sea-level rise. \n\nThe United States had its third-wettest year in history, and nine states east of the Appalachian Mountains had their wettest ever. Drought persisted all year in the Southwest, around the Four Corners, and in parts of North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Arndt and his counterpart at *NASA*{: .small}, Gavin Schmidt, also reported that there were fourteen weather-related disasters that each cost more than a billion dollars in this country, double the average of the end of the turn of the century. “Looking at those billion-dollar disasters, it seems every part of the country was affected by something,” Betsy Weatherhead, a climate scientist at Jupiter Intelligence, which analyzes climate risks to infrastructure assets and properties, told me. “Hailstorms in the middle of the country. Fires in the West. Tropical storms on the East Coast. Every part of the country has its exposure, which makes it so important to look at this regionally.” \n\nBut, when it comes to mitigating looming disasters and achieving carbon neutrality, state and local officials can only do so much. This week’s progress in Washington is promising, but deep fractures remain in the Democratic Party on how to aggressively pursue solutions to the issue. Pelosi said that the select climate committee was not specifically tasked with pursuing the Green New Deal, and, as Politico [reported](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/07/pelosi-climate-change-panel-1154847), she referred to the resolution from Ocasio-Cortez and Markey as a “suggestion.” “The green dream, or whatever they call it,” Pelosi said, “nobody knows what it is but they’re for it, right?” Without a unified front, the Democrats risk wasting valuable time that should be devoted to enacting federal policies to reduce emissions by as much as three per cent a year over the next several years—the necessary amount if the U.S. is to meet its climate targets under the Paris Agreement. If emissions are an accelerator on the climate, Schmidt said during his presentation, “We still collectively have our foot on that accelerator. While there are some indications in some parts of the world that people are working quite hard to reduce those emissions, collectively, we are not doing so.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate

There is no other option.”\n\nNow, less than three months later, sixty house Democrats and nine Senate Democrats, including five announced or expected Presidential contenders—Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Bernie Sanders—have backed a resolution outlining the principles and goals of a Green New Deal. Once drafted, the legislation will be the most ambitious climate effort that Congress has ever considered. On Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey, the resolution’s lead sponsors, marked its introduction with a press conference outside the Senate.\n\n“Five decades ago, President Kennedy announced the ambitious goal of sending an American safely to the moon,” Markey said. “He didn’t say how it would be done but that we would do it. We would need a giant rocket made of new metal alloys that had not been invented yet, and it would have to be returned safely to Earth within ten years. He urged us to be bold. I say today that it is time for us to be bold once again.” \n\n“This is a big day for activists all over the country and for frontline communities all over the country,” Ocasio-Cortez said during her turn at the podium. “Today is a big day for people who have been left behind. Today is a big day for workers in Appalachia. Today is a big day for children that have been breathing dirty air in the South Bronx.”\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\n\nThe resolution puts forward the broad goals talked up by Ocasio-Cortez, Markey, and others but avoids some of the fault lines that have emerged between climate activists and moderate Democrats over the past few weeks. Most notably, the resolution does not explicitly call for a ban on fossil fuels, one of the ideas initially put forward by some climate activists. It instead says that the Green New Deal will work toward “meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources”—language that leaves open the possibility of sustaining or expanding nuclear energy, which had been rejected in an open letter last month from over six hundred environmental groups, including the Sunrise Movement. The resolution also does not rule out the possibility of a carbon tax—an idea favored by centrists but viewed as inadequate by many climate activists.\n\nAt the press conference, Ocasio-Cortez referred obliquely to debates over particular provisions. “When people say, what about this or what about that, the answer isn’t, ‘This is why it isn’t in here,’ the answer is, ‘That is part of the solution, too,’ and so I hope you all see that.”\n\nFor Greg Carlock, of the progressive group Data for Progress, which has offered its own Green New Deal outline and has been privy to the talks over the resolution, those debates are secondary to the task of getting members of Congress to take the Green New Deal’s overarching goals seriously. “I think some people will look at this and then tell you all the reasons why, as a legislative agenda, it’s too ambitious or controversial,” he says. “They’ll kind of say, ‘Look at the fossil-fuel ban,’ or look at renewable versus clean and all that kind of stuff. And I see this as a commitment to an effort to meet the scale and urgency of the challenges and define a vision for where we want to drive the country and society. It’s kind of asking Congress to go down on the record.”\n\nOn the specific matter of banning fossil fuels, Julian NoiseCat, of the climate group 350\\.org, says that the language in the resolution meshes with the goal of eliminating fossil fuels without alienating the various progressive stakeholders whom Green New Deal advocates will have to win over. “Any Green New Deal would entail conversation and compromise between the many, many actors across progressive space,” he says, “which would include labor unions that represent fossil-fuel workers—all sorts of different sectors of society. That being said, I think that, given how inclusive they’ve aimed to be in the drafting of this, there was actually some very ambitious language in there about how we are going to transition off of fossil fuel.”\n\nThe Green New Deal has always been far more than a climate plan. There are planks on strengthening antitrust policy, protecting the right of workers to organize, and providing every American with “high-quality health care” and “affordable, safe, and adequate housing.” Perhaps most ambitiously, the resolution calls for a green federal job guarantee—every American, it suggests, will have a job opportunity tied to the project of transitioning America to clean and sustainable energy. All will be paid for primarily, an F.A.Q. offered by Ocasio-Cortez’s team implies, with debt spending. \n\nThe fact that five of the Party’s leading Presidential contenders and sixty Congressional Democrats have signed onto legislation containing these proposals is remarkable. It is an even clearer sign than growing Democratic support for single-payer health care that the era of Clintonian triangulation is over—that the question leading Democrats are asking is not whether the Party should move left but how far left it should go. \n\nThe resolution is also in keeping with the Democratic Party’s longstanding strategy on climate—the Party has long assumed, probably correctly, that major climate action is unlikely unless addressing the crisis is woven securely into the Party’s economic agenda. A job guarantee, as radical as it seems, is an extension of the same logic that led the Obama Administration to tout the creation of green jobs. The resolution also ties climate action to the advancement of a variety of demographic groups, including many clearly important to the Party’s political future. There is much in the text about “frontline and vulnerable communities,” defined as “indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth,” for whom the Green New Deal will also “promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future, and repairing historic oppression.”\n\n\n-=-=-=-\nAs the resolution begins moving through both chambers, Representative Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Markey, and other supporters will be drafting the legislation that the Green New Deal outlines. A source close to Senator Bernie Sanders told me on Thursday that he will unveil a Green New Deal bill within the next several months. “Obviously the Green New Deal is an expansive policy,” Stephen O’Hanlon, a spokesperson for the Sunrise Movement, says. “It’s going to need to be multiple bills and long bills, so they’re working on that.” Of course, no bill they propose will be taken up unless Democrats win the White House in 2020, unseating a President who has claimed repeatedly that climate change is a hoax. In 2010, Democrats, who held the Presidency, the House, and the Senate, elected not to advance an ambitious cap-and-trade bill co-authored by Senator Markey, because they failed to secure the sixty Senate votes necessary to break a Republican filibuster. But the majority Party in the Senate can eliminate the filibuster unilaterally, provided it has fifty-one votes for doing so—a tactic  used in recent years to eliminate the filibuster for executive and judicial nominees. At Thursday’s conference, I asked Markey whether, the next time Democrats hold Congress and the Presidency, they should eliminate the Senate filibuster to pass the Green New Deal. “That would be a good problem to have!” he said. “My own feeling is that this is going to be such a powerful issue in the 2020 election cycle that we’re going to have the Republican support, all across the country, to pass it with sixty votes and a supermajority in the House as well.”\n\nThe Trump-era Republican Party, though, will not be budging from climate skepticism any time soon. And, even if Democrats do extraordinarily well in the 2020 Senate elections, it is extremely unlikely that they will win sixty seats. In the best-case scenario for Democrats, the only paths forward for climate legislation are the elimination of the filibuster or, perhaps, the passage of certain tax and spending provisions through budget reconciliation, a maneuver that only requires a simple majority. These are also the only ways to pass other ambitious parts of the Democratic agenda, such as Medicare for All, now nominally supported by all of the Party’s top-tier 2020 Presidential candidates. Denial about this is widespread—no candidate, not even Bernie Sanders, has openly supported eliminating the filibuster. Deploying it would radically transform federal lawmaking and bring American politics to a new, precarious place. It is difficult to imagine Democrats building the will to consider that move easily. It was also difficult to imagine, mere months ago, that the Green New Deal would become the Party’s flagship proposal for climate action. Yet, here we are. \n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate Change","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"climate-change"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a4a08312cd3aa6c3d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Green New Deal","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"green-new-deal"},{"id":"5c2e1c7936cecf40192141cc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Democratic Party","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"democratic-party"},{"id":"5c2e1c762710c62d10815407","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5b90190af241c1681cbddf6f","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Osita Nwanevu joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2018, covering politics and policy in Washington, D.C.

We are now dangerously on track to hit his estimate, four hundred and eighty-seven parts per million, by 2030.\n\nIn the United States, after three years of decline, carbon-dioxide emissions increased by an estimated 3\\.4 per cent in 2018, according to a report released earlier this month by the Rhodium Group, a private climate-research firm. The authors blame two main factors: a particularly cold winter and fast economic growth. In the past two decades, the only greater annual gain in emissions was in 2010, when the economy was rebounding from the Great Recession. Historically, emissions have aligned with the ebb and flow of the economy. In 2018, economic growth was driven by a higher demand for energy, trucking and air travel, and industrial activity. Companies were manufacturing more stuff, including steel, cement, and chemicals. The carbon intensity of the power sector, meanwhile, did not decline fast enough to offset all those demand increases. As has been common since Nordhaus’s 1974 paper, the report seems to pit controlling climate change against a growing global economy.\n\nThe picture could have been much different. Nordhaus went on to publish a series of foundational studies on the economics of climate change. In 1992, he created an integrated economic and scientific model that could be used to determine the most efficient ways to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. His work—and that of many other [economists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/oils-swoon-creates-the-opening-for-a-carbon-tax/2015/01/04/3db11a3a-928a-11e4-ba53-a477d66580ed_story.html?utm_term=.3b2ffd8df324) who [followed](https://www.nber.org/papers/w4896.pdf?new_window=1) his lead—showed that a low tax on carbon, set to rise slowly over time, could be enough to keep emissions at reasonable levels, saving us from climate change at little, if any, cost. A “spaceship economy” could thrive if governments made sure that companies paid an appropriate price for the environmental damage they caused—what would come to be called the social cost of carbon. Companies that were most easily able to reduce their level of pollution would be incentivized to make the greatest reductions, and to invest in cheaper and better pollution-reduction systems.The dirtiest activities would be the most costly. The tax would promote innovations in new forms of power generation and, eventually, a widespread adoption of clean-energy technologies. The way to break the chain was to reimagine how we fuel the global economy. “It’s absolutely the case that emissions and growth can be decoupled,” Marshall Burke, an assistant professor in Stanford University’s Department of Earth System Science, told me. He pointed to [research](https://www.carbonbrief.org/the-35-countries-cutting-the-link-between-economic-growth-and-emissions) plotting how thirty-five countries, including the United States, did, in fact, experience economic growth in the past fifteen years while reducing their emissions—and not solely due to recessions. But the decline was not nearly enough. “The technology is available to have faster economic growth while reducing over-all emissions,” Trevor Houser, the head of Rhodium Group’s energy and climate team, and one of the authors of the report, told me. But the switch to nuclear and renewables needs to happen more rapidly. “It takes policy. It won’t happen through markets alone,” Houser said.\n\nIn October, Nordhaus and another economist, Paul Romer, won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for, respectively, “integrating climate change” and “technological innovations” into “long-run macroeconomic analysis.” The timing of the announcement from Sweden was painfully ironic. Hours earlier, the United Nations had released its [dire report](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-dire-warnings-of-the-united-nations-latest-climate-change-report) warning that, if climate change’s worst impacts were to be avoided, the nations of the world had about a decade to revolutionize the energy economy. “The policies are lagging very, very far—miles, miles, miles behind the science and what needs to be done,” Nordhaus said after receiving the prize. “It’s hard to be optimistic&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We’re actually going backward in the United States, with the disastrous policies of the Trump Administration.” The Obama Administration had, in its final years, partially incorporated concepts that Nordhaus had helped to develop, such as putting a price on the economic harm that results from every additional ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere. The price was set at forty-five dollars a ton, and used in both regulatory cost-benefit analyses, which undergirded new fuel-efficiency standards, and the Clean Power Plan, which would have propelled a faster retirement of coal-powered electric plants and a broader transition to renewables. Just as such policies were “beginning to bear fruit,” Houser said, “that whole framework was dismantled.” Under [Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump), the social cost of a ton of carbon is as little as one dollar.\n\nAs emissions keep growing, and climate change advances, there is less and less time to make the necessary cuts. “The pace we needed to decline was already much larger than what was happening,” Houser told me. “Now we have to go even faster to meet our Paris Agreement target by 2025”—on average, a 2\\.6-per-cent reduction in annual energy-related carbon-dioxide emissions in the next seven years. “That is considerably faster than at any point in history,” he said. And it will need to go even faster if declines in other greenhouse gases, including methane and hydrofluorocarbons—which endure in the atmosphere for much shorter amounts of time than carbon dioxide but are much more potent—do not keep pace. \n\nA modest carbon tax of the sort Nordhaus proposed decades ago—one that was then palatable to conservatives—will therefore no longer bring us anywhere near the Paris Agreement targets. But it’s one of many weapons in the arsenal that policymakers need to employ. “The real challenge is finding ways to reduce emissions and maintain economic growth on the timeline demanded by the nature of climate change,” Kenneth Gillingham, an associate professor of economics at Yale University, told me. But, as much as the costs of climate mitigation will undoubtedly increase, the question is whether the benefits of mitigation exceed those costs. “It’s a straw man—and terrible economics—to just point out the costs while ignoring the benefits,” Burke said. He and two co-authors published a paper in *Nature* last May that shows that the economic benefits of mitigation are going to be much larger than previously believed. Cooler temperatures would help maintain and grow productivity, and reducing carbon emissions means reducing air pollution—specifically particulate matter, or soot—which brings immediate health benefits. They found that keeping global warming to one and a half degrees Celsius (which is nearly impossible at this point), as opposed to two degrees Celsius, would potentially save more than twenty trillion dollars around the world by the end of the century, and significantly reduce global inequality. Beyond two degrees, they wrote, “we find considerably greater reductions in global economic output.” If nations met their commitments under the Paris Agreement, the world would still see the average global temperature rise by two and a half to three degrees Celsius, which, according to Burke’s paper, would result in a fifteen-to-twenty-five-per-cent reduction in per capita output by 2100. “To just complain about the costs of this transition and ignore the benefits, as is common in the discussion from this Administration,” Burke said, “is some pretty poor cost-benefit analysis from an Administration that prides itself on economic savvy.”\n\nAs a small but growing coalition of congressional Democrats, led by Representative [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/23/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-historic-win-and-the-future-of-the-democratic-party), have outlined as part of their Green New Deal, transforming the energy sector—and, really, the entire economy, in a just and more equitable way—will require some sort of carbon tax (preferably a “fee and dividend” approach, which distributes tax revenues as rebates directly to citizens), and also new regulations and huge investments. “We can decarbonize the electric sector at a fairly low cost,” Gillingham told me. “That’s where some of the cheapest emissions reductions are to be found.” Extensive government subsidies could hasten the spread of renewables—specifically, solar, wind, and batteries—and offset any rise in emissions elsewhere. As Gillingham said, “We might want to be careful about fighting climate change by preventing people from staying warm in the winter. If a winter is really cold enough, emissions increases are to be expected.” Still, there are ways to reduce the use of fossil fuels in heating; utilities, for instance, can create incentive programs so that homeowners have a motivation to replace their boilers with electric heat pumps.\n\nHouser told me that total emissions are expected to remain flat in 2019. Economists and other market observers predict that over-all economic growth will be slower, and the full impact of recent cuts to coal-plant capacity (2018 was a near-record year) has not yet been recorded. Still, in the absence of major policy changes—which is mostly dependent on a new President who makes climate policy a top and urgent priority—there is almost no chance that the U.S. will achieve the average emissions cuts necessary to meet the Paris targets by 2025. Houser told me that our only hope would be extremely favorable market and technological conditions. “If, over the next couple of years, no more nuclear power plants retired”—more than a dozen are scheduled to retire in the next seven years—“wind, solar, and battery prices fall far faster than the currently most optimistic projections estimate, it is possible that we could come pretty close to meeting the Paris Agreement targets,” he said. States, cities, and private organizations would also have to pick up a tremendous amount of slack from Washington. Even warmer winters would help. “Everything would really have to light up in the right direction,” Houser said. “It’s also, of course, possible that, if there was a massive global recession, we’d see a significant decline, too. But that’s not the reason we want emissions to decline.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate Change","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"climate-change"},{"id":"5c2e20b441e4c73c088d7aa5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Economic Growth","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"economic-growth"},{"id":"5c2e1ca541c92e2c9b85da60","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Paris Agreement","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"paris-agreement"},{"id":"5c2e1cb136cecf4019214235","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Carbon Tax","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"carbon-tax"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a4a08312cd3aa6c3d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Green New Deal","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"green-new-deal"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590c9eaeda97f12ef9160003","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Carolyn Kormann has been a contributor to the *The New Yorker* since 2012, and became a staff writer in 2018, covering energy, the environment, and climate change.

the full experience, [click here.](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-thieves-target-gun-stores)_\n+++\n\nMost gun stores face no legal requirements to secure the weapons they sell. This sets them apart from other businesses that deal in dangerous products, such as pharmacies and explosives makers.\n\nThieves have taken notice.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, Cruise Scott was twenty-two and looking for a quick way to make money. He lived with his grandmother near Fayetteville, North Carolina, a small city whose proximity to Fort Bragg and stubbornly high crime rate had earned it the nickname Fayettenam. A couple of years earlier, Scott had been arrested for possession of stolen goods, including cologne and a video-game console, and he served six months in state prison. After his release, in April, 2014, he got a job at a poultry plant and scraped by on about two hundred and fifty dollars a week; barely able to afford food, he began looking for new ways to fill his wallet. He thought about leveraging his network to sell drugs, but that was risky and required a big upfront investment, so he decided that it would be “too much of a hassle.” Scott had grown up around guns—he had been robbed at gunpoint and shot at—and had developed a liking for them. “It’s just a fetish, man. I love ’em,” he said. “Where we from, I’d rather be caught with it than without it.” He knew that he could make money selling guns to people with criminal records, who couldn’t buy them legally. He knew which brands—Glock, Sig Sauer, Beretta—were coveted on the street. Most important, he knew that gun stores in North Carolina had few security precautions, which made stealing from them easy. “It’s like taking candy from a baby,” Scott told me.\n\n\n----------\n\n\nThis story was published in partnership with [The Trace](https://thetrace.org/features/gun-store-theft-trafficking-atf), a nonprofit news organization covering guns in America.\n\n\n----------\n\n\nAround 2:30 *A.M.*{: .small} on August 5, 2014, Scott and his younger cousin Jeremy Aycock crept up to the front door of Mike’s Hunting Shop—a brick store with a green awning in Clinton, North Carolina—wearing bandannas around their faces. They used a screwdriver to pop open the door and, once inside, bolt cutters to make a slit in the floor-to-ceiling chain-link gate. As an alarm emitted a high-pitched beep, they shattered the store’s glass gun cases with a hammer. They grabbed as many handguns as they could carry and sprinted out the front door. “Hit and get out,” Scott said. “It was simple.” \n\nOver the next four months, Scott and Aycock—often along with Ahkeem Pratt, Scott’s childhood friend—burglarized at least five more stores in the state, including Wilmington Guns and BullZeye Shooting Sports. \n\nAt Firearms and Etc., in Dunn, they crawled in through the building’s ventilation system. Security-camera footage shows one of them crashing down from the ceiling, his headlamp beaming through a cloud of dust; the other two men drop in behind him. \n\nThey grabbed twenty-one guns and ran out the front door in less than sixty seconds. \n\nAt Calypso Wholesale, in rural Duplin County, they sawed a hole in the roof and then used the shelves as a ladder to climb down into the store. \n\nThe gun cases were unlocked, so, instead of smashing them, they slid them open. No alarm sounded, and they took their time loading roughly seventy-four guns into their bags—the biggest haul of their criminal campaign. Scott’s bag was so heavy that it broke as he ran to the getaway car.\n\nOn at least two occasions, the crew piled into an S.U.V. and drove up I-95, to New Jersey. Scott knew that he could make more money selling his guns in the Northeast, where stricter laws had made it more difficult for convicted felons and other prohibited purchasers to acquire firearms. “Up top, it’s hot,” he said. “If something comes their way, they jump on it.” In the suburbs outside Camden, they rented a room at a cheap motel, where they met Jonathan Shaw, another one of Scott’s cousins, and handed him the guns in a black duffel bag. They waited while Shaw and his associates sold the guns on the street. Scott didn’t ask much about this side of the business. “As long as you bring back my green, I don’t care who you’re selling to,” he said. Within a few days, Shaw returned and paid them their cut in cash. “He was just, like, ‘Keep ’em coming,’ and that was it,” Scott said.\n\nBy early November, the burglars had stolen some two hundred guns—more than half of all the firearms lifted from licensed dealers in North Carolina that year. Their cache became so big that it was difficult to hide it all in their homes. “Guns were just everywhere,” Allan Wells, one of Pratt’s roommates, told me. “Under the bed, in the damned cabinets, under the oven.” According to Scott, the group netted around sixty or seventy thousand dollars, which they used to splurge on bluejeans, Timberland boots, an Xbox, and jewelry. Their windfall could have been bigger, but, to reduce their stockpile, they offloaded some guns quickly in North Carolina, and even used them as a kind of currency: Scott gave a couple to Shaw as a tip, and traded a pistol with another associate for an electronic cigarette. Had Scott sold all the guns to the highest bidders in New Jersey, he thinks that he could have made at least a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. “The stock market goes up and down,” he said. “But guns—the demand for them stays the same.”\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nScott’s spree tracks with a national trend: in recent years, burglaries at gun shops and other federal firearms licensees have increased, from three hundred and seventy-seven, in 2012, to five hundred and seventy-seven, in 2017\\. This is partly because guns are so readily available. There are some sixty-three thousand licensed gun dealers in America—more than twice the number of McDonald’s and Starbucks locations combined. These retailers operate out of storefronts, pawnshops, and homes. (The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives doesn’t specify how many dealers are based in homes, but officials say that the majority of thefts occur in brick-and-mortar stores.) Federal regulators have set strict security protocols for other businesses that deal in dangerous products. Pharmacies must lock opioids and other controlled substances in fortified cabinets. Explosives makers have to keep volatile materials in boxes or rooms capable of withstanding explosions. Banks, in order to maintain federal deposit insurance, have to hire security officers. But there are no such requirements for gun stores, and criminals are taking advantage. Between 2012 and 2017, burglars stole more than thirty-two thousand firearms from gun dealers. “Lost and stolen firearms pose a substantial threat to public safety and to law enforcement,” the A.T.F. wrote, in a 2012 report. “Those that steal firearms commit violent crimes with stolen guns, transfer stolen firearms to others who commit crimes, and create an unregulated secondary market.”\n\nOnly four states—California, Connecticut, Minnesota, and New Jersey—have enacted laws requiring gun stores to impose physical security measures, but even those regulations tend to be narrow. Minnesota established security protocols twenty-five years ago, but they don’t spell out how violators are to be penalized. “They’re not really rules; they’re more like guidelines,” Richard Hodsdon, the general counsel for the Minnesota Sheriffs’ Association, told me. “I’m not even sure how many people who have firearms dealerships are aware of them.” Connecticut mandates only that dealers install alarm systems. But statistics suggest that even modest measures have proved effective: between 2012 and 2017, states with physical-security requirements had lower annual rates of gun theft than those without. This takes into account the fact that thefts increased in California in 2016, as thieves figured out that they could bypass most safeguards by ramming cars through storefronts. When California is removed from the analysis, the annual number of burglaries in states with security requirements drops by as much as eighty-eight per cent. New Jersey has been especially successful at warding off burglaries. Rules adopted in 1971 require gun shops in the state to obtain approval for their security plans from the superintendent of the state police before opening for business, and to keep weapons locked up. (In 2014, the Republican Chris Christie, who was then the state’s governor, proposed even stiffer requirements, but they were not adopted in full.) Between 2012 and 2017, burglars in New Jersey stole only three guns; burglars in North Carolina, meanwhile, stole more than fourteen hundred.\n\nEfforts to expand such requirements to other states have succumbed to [stiff opposition](https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/domestic-terrorism-and-americas-gun-dilemma) from gun-rights groups and their Republican allies. Some dealers voluntarily install security measures, such as alarms and cameras, for insurance reasons. But many are mom-and-pop shops that feel squeezed by low profit margins and rising competition from online retailers; their owners see security mandates as another blow to the bottom line. \n “If you have to sit there for an hour and a half and put guns in a safe or a lockbox and then the next morning take them back out, that’s just not going to be cost-effective,” Charlie Lewis, the owner of BullZeye Shooting Sports, one of the shops that Scott burglarized, told me. In 2017, lawmakers in Wisconsin introduced gun-store security bills, inspired by an anarchist who sent a rambling anti-government manifesto to President Donald Trump, stole more than a dozen firearms in Janesville, and allegedly made threats against schools and churches, causing them to go into lockdown. The bills died in committees chaired by N.R.A.-backed Republicans.“The N.R.A. has had such a stranglehold on the Republican Party for so long, and so many of those Republican legislators are depending on N.R.A. money,” Lisa Subeck, a Democratic state representative and a primary sponsor of one of the bills, told me. “That gets in the way.”\n\nAt the federal level, Senator Dick Durbin and Representative Brad Schneider, both Democrats of Illinois, introduced bills in 2017 that would have penalized gun stores that failed to lock up their inventories, but the bills languished in committee for more than a year without a vote from the Republican-controlled Congress. Last week, Durbin and Schneider introduced similar legislation, called the *SECURE*{: .small} Firearm Storage Act. “Dealers that benefit from a federal license should be expected to keep their inventories safe,” Schneider told me. Also in 2017, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Representative Steve Russell, Republican of Oklahoma, sponsored alternative bills that would have doubled the maximum prison sentence, to twenty years, for stealing firearms from licensed gun dealers. Lawrence Keane, a senior vice-president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a gun-industry trade group, called the House bill “a significant reinforcement of our federal laws.” But this approach contradicts a growing body of research, which suggests that the probability of being apprehended is far more effective at deterring criminals than the severity of the potential punishment. And even this legislation failed.\n\nDemocratic state lawmakers in North Carolina told me that the issue of gun-store security requirements had never come to their attention. They were all supportive of the idea but said that it was likely a non-starter in the legislature, which is dominated by Republicans. Since taking control in 2011, Republican legislators have made it [easier to acquire](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/27/after-orlando-examining-the-gun-business) machine guns, allowed  concealed firearms in bars and restaurants, and authorized gun owners to lock weapons in their cars on public-school grounds. Pricey Harrison, a Democratic state representative from Greensboro, told me that she thinks gun theft should be a nonpartisan issue. “If guns are getting stolen out of North Carolina because we don’t have proper security measures, and are being used to murder people in other states, we have got to fix that,” she said.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn August, 2014, the investigation of Scott’s burglaries fell to an A.T.F. agent named Eddie Eubanks. At forty-four, Eubanks is stocky and spirited, with short black hair and a mild Southern drawl. Eubanks suspected that the break-ins were the work of the same group: the thieves often dressed in coveralls, wore their backpacks in front of them, and left tools behind at the scene; in two instances, he spotted Pratt’s shoulder-length dreadlocks peeking out of the hood of his sweatshirt. But the thieves wore gloves and masked their faces, so Eubanks was unable to pull fingerprints or figure out what they looked like. “We had nothing,” Eubanks told me. After the break-in at Calypso Wholesale, the A.T.F., the local sheriff’s office, and the National Shooting Sports Foundation offered a fifteen-thousand-dollar reward for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of the thieves. “We knew these guys weren’t going to stop until we caught them,” Eubanks said. “They were having an easy time of it. They were good at it. They were quick.”\n\nBy December, 2014, law-enforcement officers had recovered eight of the guns at local crime scenes. In Fayetteville, police found a .45-calibre Springfield Armory handgun from Calypso Wholesale on a twenty-five-year-old after he held up a Scotchman convenience store and threatened to kill the clerk. In Harnett County, sheriff’s deputies said that they found an assailant, who had attempted to rob an eighteen-year-old at gunpoint, in his girlfriend’s bedroom with a .380-calibre Bersa handgun from Firearms and Etc. within reach. A.T.F. informants and agents were intercepting some of the guns in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, raising alarms within the bureau. Agents rushed to set up undercover buys in the hopes of stopping the weapons from being used in violent crimes. Eubanks recalled supervisors telling agents, “If you got to spend thirty grand to get the guns off the street, that’s what we have the money for.” Those efforts paid off. In 2015, the A.T.F. brought charges against a high-school counsellor from Camden who had helped Shaw sell guns while running a nonprofit track program for kids. Agents also arrested an associate of the counsellor, a forty-one-year-old hospital clerk who was caught hawking guns out of his Nissan Maxima while wearing his scrubs.\n\nEubanks was tracing the guns through the so-called Iron Pipeline, a trafficking corridor that funnels firearms up I-95, from less heavily regulated states, in the South, to states with stricter gun laws, in the Northeast. The flow is governed by simple supply and demand: a gun that sells for two hundred dollars on the street in North Carolina can fetch more than a thousand dollars in New Jersey. Between 2012 and 2017, the A.T.F. traced more than fourteen thousand guns used in crimes in New Jersey, and found that some eighty per cent had originated in other states; nearly half came from the South, including more than twelve hundred from North Carolina. The influx of firearms to states with tougher laws undermines those states’ efforts to curb criminals’ access to guns. According to the A.T.F., each year, tens of thousands of guns are moved across state lines and subsequently recovered in connection with a crime.\n\nScott’s scheme began to unravel in the fall of 2014, after an A.T.F. lab found Aycock’s DNA on a pair of bolt cutters left at Calypso Wholesale. When Eubanks confronted Aycock, he gave up his two accomplices. Three days later, Scott was watching the movie “Scarface” with his girlfriend, who was pregnant, and Pratt, when they heard a knock at the front door. Scott looked outside, saw police surrounding the apartment, and threw on a shirt. “I love you,” he told his girlfriend. “Take care of my son.” He and Pratt ran out the back door as officers stormed through the front door. “You ever seen a swarm of bees?” Scott’s girlfriend asked me. “That’s what they looked like.” They caught up with Pratt and shot him with a Taser. Scott darted through yards, hopped over fences, and then hid in a tall green trash can for hours. He spent the next six months on the run. At some point, he drove up to Philadelphia to sell the last ten or fifteen guns he had. Eventually, a police dog led officers to a house in Kinston, North Carolina, where they found Scott curled up underneath a porch and arrested him. Eubanks called the jail when he learned that Scott was in custody. “Do not let that guy go,” he said.\n\nThe three burglars took pleas, and Scott received a fourteen-year prison sentence, which he is now serving in a federal penitentiary. When I interviewed him in December, 2016, in a state prison in North Carolina, I asked him how he felt about the fact that the guns he stole wound up being used in crimes. “I don’t feel guilty about nothing,” Scott said. “People make their own choices, and at the end of the day they’re responsible.” (Pratt and Aycock declined requests for interviews.) Eubanks said that the thefts by Scott and his team have had far-reaching repercussions; they demonstrated how easy it was to steal guns, which led to a wave of copycat group burglaries. “Yes, we had gun-store break-ins,” Eubanks said. “But since this happened, in 2014, North Carolina and South Carolina gun thefts have significantly increased.”\n\nEven with the crew behind bars, the guns cut an arc of violence across the country. It’s difficult to discern the full scale of gun trafficking in the U.S., owing in part to the Tiahrt Amendments, a series of provisions that Congress began passing in 2003\\. The amendments bar the A.T.F. from publicly disclosing detailed information about the provenance of individual guns used in crimes. The N.R.A. pushed for the provisions and has fought efforts to repeal them, arguing that public access to the data would unfairly stigmatize businesses and violate the privacy of gun owners. Before the passage of the Tiahrt Amendments, reporters and researchers could use the A.T.F.’s data to determine whether a stolen gun had been recovered at a crime scene. Today, tracking such weapons is painstaking, and requires cross-referencing the serial numbers listed on reports of stolen guns with those on police reports for crimes. [The Trace](https://thetrace.org/features/gun-store-theft-trafficking-atf) and *The New Yorker*, working around the Tiahrt Amendments, relied on thousands of public records and more than fifty interviews to track Scott’s guns through a network of black-market profiteers.\n\nWithin three years of Scott’s first burglary, at least sixty-eight of the guns his crew stole were involved in crimes. Twenty-two surfaced in North Carolina: a habitual felon in Fayetteville fired a 9-mm. Sarsilmaz that had been stolen from Calypso Wholesale at a car carrying a four-year-old boy. In Beulaville, a twenty-five-year-old man threw his teen-age neighbor to the ground and pointed a Heritage revolver from Firearms and Etc. at the boy’s head. Most of the guns wound up in the Northeast: in Philadelphia, an eighteen-year-old shoved a .22-calibre Chiappa from BullZeye Shooting Sports into a man’s neck and demanded that he empty his pockets. A 9-mm. Smith & Wesson from Calypso Wholesale surfaced in a small town in Western Pennsylvania, where a cocaine dealer is alleged to have used it to kill a twenty-three-year-old man over an eight-hundred-and-forty-dollar drug debt. In Camden, New Jersey, police stormed an apartment in which two drug dealers were flushing crack down a toilet, and recovered a Glock 34 from Wilmington Guns. A Taurus taken from Firearms and Etc. was seized in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, after an assailant held it to a woman’s head while he raped her. \n\n-=-=-=\n\nAt least one of the guns ended up in Maryland. On May 10, 2015, in Baltimore, Harry Davis, Jr., was preparing a Mother’s Day celebration for his wife, Zoronda, and his mother, Deborah McMillion. Davis was thirty-six, stood more than six feet tall, and had buzzed hair and a goatee; his friends knew him as Huck or Big Guy. He earned a living fixing up homes with his cousin and enjoyed angling for catfish in the Choptank River, coaching youth football, and playing video games with his sixteen-year-old son, Shamond. Davis and Zoronda had been friends for nearly a decade when, in 2007, he confessed that he was secretly in love with her. “He had me call my mother on my cell phone to tell her how much he loved me,” Zoronda told me. “No one’s ever done that.” They got married just a few months before that Mother’s Day. Davis spent the afternoon grilling salmon to top with crab and shrimp. He presented Zoronda with cards from each member of their immediate family, and ghostwrote ones from Sir Cameron, their six-month-old son, and Candy, their pit bull.\n\nAfter dinner, Davis relaxed in the back yard, enjoying the warm night with a Black & Mild cigar. Around 10:30 *P.M.*{: .small}, Matthew Hughes, a stocky thirty-two-year-old, walked out of Pepper’s Liquors, which is on the other side of a nearby alley, carrying a beer in a black plastic bag. Surveillance footage from the liquor store shows that Hughes stopped by Davis’s chain-link fence to talk to him. A moment later, they were joined by an acquaintance of Davis’s named Marquis Richardson. Davis and Richardson sometimes played cards in the back yard, and when Shamond was young, he went to a day care run by Richardson’s mother. Richardson had spent time behind bars for conspiring to sell drugs; when he was released, in 2016, Davis tried to help him get a job. Hughes was new to the neighborhood, and also had a rap sheet. He had been convicted of possessing drugs and an illegal weapon, and had served several years in federal prison before being released, in 2014\\. \n\nWhat the three men talked about at the fence is unclear. But, after about a minute, Davis turned to walk toward his house. Hughes pulled out a pistol and shot him in his lower back, thighs, and just above his right elbow. Zoronda rushed out of the house in time to see Hughes and Richardson running down the alley. She collapsed to her knees, felt for Davis’s pulse, and started performing CPR. Shamond called 911\\. When the ambulance took too long to arrive, he leaped over the fence, sprinted to the fire station, and shouted for help: “My father’s been shot!” Paramedics sped Davis to Sinai Hospital, where doctors tried in vain to save him. He died at 11:53 *P.M.*{: .small} Zoronda sneaked into a restricted part of the hospital to say goodbye.\n\nAbout thirty minutes after Davis was shot, his neighbors heard gunfire from an alley a block from his house. Police arrived at the scene to find Hughes lying face down on the asphalt, with point-blank gunshot wounds to his face and torso. He died soon after. The lead detective on Davis’s murder investigation thinks that Hughes had tried to rob Davis, and, when Davis rebuffed him, Hughes opened fire. Detectives speculate that Richardson shot Hughes as payback for Davis’s death. (Davis’s family wish that the police had investigated further, and could provide them with more clarity about the killing. Richardson turned down several requests to be interviewed for this piece, and, on Christmas Day in 2018, he, too, was killed in a shooting.) Because of Hughes’s criminal record, he was not legally allowed to have a firearm, but, in the right side of his waistband, officers recovered a pistol that matched the shell casings found next to Davis’s body: a 9-mm. Ruger SR9c, with a black frame and a scuffed stainless-steel slide. Cruise Scott had stolen it from Calypso Wholesale.\n\nIn early 2017, I visited Deborah McMillion, Davis’s mother, at her home in Baltimore. She sat at her dining-room table with faded photographs of Davis arrayed in front of her. One picture featured Davis at McDonald’s, enjoying his second-birthday party. Another showed him sitting on the porch as a young boy, pursing his lips to kiss a neighbor. “He’s an only child, so I captured every piece of his life,” McMillion said. “One of the things I miss the most are my phone calls. ‘Hey, Momma, how you doing? I didn’t want nothing. I was just calling to say hi and I love you.’” For a time, McMillion kept a lawn chair in her car so that she could sit and read by Davis’s grave on her way home from work. Shamond got a tattoo on his arm of a football under the words “Big Huck.” Unable to bear living in the house where her husband was killed, Zoronda left the neighborhood. When I visited her new home, she had just wrapped up a twelfth-birthday party for her daughter Aniya, who witnessed the shooting. Aniya’s bedroom walls were adorned with little notes that she had addressed to her father. In one, she wrote that she missed “the way you laughed and your bad Dance moves.” Sir Cameron is now four. He recently asked Zoronda where his father was. “Your daddy’s in Heaven,” she told him. “Can I go visit?” he asked. Zoronda believes that Davis would still be alive if Hughes had never acquired the Ruger pistol. She places some of the blame for his death on the thieves who introduced the weapon into the black market. “No, you did not directly pick up that gun and kill him,” she said. “But, damn it, it could have been a lot harder.”\n\n\n----------\n\n\nThis gun-trafficking map is based on the most recent comprehensive data furnished [by the A.T.F., from 2017](https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/firearms-trace-data-2017), and illustrates the top hundred routes of guns that were purchased in another state at some point prior to 2017, and subsequently recovered in connection with a crime. The map excludes firearms that were recovered in the same state in which they were originally purchased; in every state, this category accounts for the largest share of guns recovered in association with crimes. \n\nThe analysis, which shows that states with physical gun-store-security requirements experienced lower rates of theft, is based on the A.T.F.’s [theft and loss reports from 2012 to

seven-thirty on the morning of February 27th, a seventeen-year-old boy named T. J. Lane walked into the cafeteria at Chardon High School, about thirty miles outside Cleveland. It was a Monday, and the cafeteria was filled with kids, some eating breakfast, some waiting for buses to drive them to programs at other schools, some packing up for gym class. Lane sat down at an empty table, reached into a bag, and pulled out a .22-calibre pistol. He stood up, raised the gun, and fired. He said not a word.\n\n\n\n\n\nRussell King, a seventeen-year-old junior, was sitting at a table with another junior, Nate Mueller. King, shot in the head, fell face first onto the table, a pool of blood forming. A bullet grazed Mueller’s ear. “I could see the flame at the end of the gun,” Mueller said later. Daniel Parmertor, a sixteen-year-old snowboarder, was shot in the head. Someone screamed “Duck!” Demetrius Hewlin, sixteen, was also shot in the head, and slid under the table. Joy Rickers, a senior, tried to run; Lane shot her as she fled. Nickolas Walczak, shot in his neck, arm, back, and face, fell to the floor. He began crawling toward the door.\n\n\n\nEver since the shootings at Columbine High School, in a Denver suburb, in 1999, American schools have been preparing for gunmen. Chardon started holding drills in 2007, after the Virginia Tech massacre, when twenty-three-year-old Seung-Hui Cho, a college senior, shot fifty-seven people in Blacksburg.\n\n\n\nAt Chardon High School, kids ran through the halls screaming “Lockdown!” Some of them hid in the teachers’ lounge; they barricaded the door with a piano. Someone got on the school’s public-address system and gave instructions, but everyone knew what to do. Students ran into classrooms and dived under desks; teachers locked the doors and shut off the lights. Joseph Ricci, a math teacher, heard Walczak, who was still crawling, groaning in the hallway. Ricci opened the door and pulled the boy inside. No one knew if the shooter had more guns, or more rounds. Huddled under desks, students called 911 and texted their parents. One tapped out, “Prayforus.”\n\n\n\nFrom the cafeteria, Frank Hall, the assistant football coach, chased Lane out of the building, and he ran off into the woods.\n\n\n\nMoments later, four ambulances arrived. E.M.T.s raced Rickers and Walczak to Chardon’s Hillcrest Hospital. Hewlin, Parmertor, and King were flown by helicopter to a trauma center at MetroHealth Medical Center, in Cleveland. By eight-thirty, the high school had been evacuated.\n\n\n\nAt a quarter to nine, police officers with dogs captured Lane, about a mile from the school.\n\n\n\n“I hate to say it, but we trained for exactly this type of thing, a school emergency of this type,” Dan McClelland, the county sheriff, said.\n\n\n\nDanny Parmertor died that afternoon. That evening, St. Mary’s Church opened its doors, and the people of Chardon sank to their knees and keened. At the town square, students gathered to hold a vigil. As night fell, they lit candles. Drew Gittins, sixteen, played a Black Eyed Peas song on his guitar. “People killin’, people dyin’,” he sang. “People got me, got me questionin’, Where is the love?”\n\n\n\nRussell King had been too badly wounded. A little after midnight, doctors said that they couldn’t save him.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThere are nearly three hundred million privately owned firearms in the United States: a hundred and six million handguns, a hundred and five million rifles, and eighty-three million shotguns. That works out to about one gun for every American. The gun that T. J. Lane brought to Chardon High School belonged to his uncle, who had bought it in 2010, at a gun shop. Both of Lane’s parents had been arrested on charges of domestic violence over the years. Lane found the gun in his grandfather’s barn.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States is the country with the highest rate of civilian gun ownership in the world. (The second highest is Yemen, where the rate is nevertheless only half that of the U.S.) No civilian population is more powerfully armed. Most Americans do not, however, own guns, because three-quarters of people with guns own two or more. According to the General Social Survey, conducted by the National Policy Opinion Center at the University of Chicago, the prevalence of gun ownership has declined steadily in the past few decades. In 1973, there were guns in roughly one in two households in the United States; in 2010, one in three. In 1980, nearly one in three Americans owned a gun; in 2010, that figure had dropped to one in five.\n\n\n\nMen are far more likely to own guns than women are, but the rate of gun ownership among men fell from one in two in 1980 to one in three in 2010, while, in that same stretch of time, the rate among women remained one in ten. What may have held that rate steady in an age of decline was the aggressive marketing of handguns to women for self-defense, which is how a great many guns are marketed. Gun ownership is higher among whites than among blacks, higher in the country than in the city, and higher among older people than among younger people. One reason that gun ownership is declining, nationwide, might be that high-school shooting clubs and rifle ranges at summer camps are no longer common.\n\n\n\nAlthough rates of gun ownership, like rates of violent crime, are falling, the power of the gun lobby is not. Since 1980, forty-four states have passed some form of law that allows gun owners to carry concealed weapons outside their homes for personal protection. (Five additional states had these laws before 1980. Illinois is the sole holdout.) A federal ban on the possession, transfer, or manufacture of semiautomatic assault weapons, passed in 1994, was allowed to expire in 2004. In 2005, Florida passed the Stand Your Ground law, an extension of the so-called castle doctrine, exonerating from prosecution citizens who use deadly force when confronted by an assailant, even if they could have retreated safely; Stand Your Ground laws expand that protection outside the home to any place that an individual “has a right to be.” Twenty-four states have passed similar laws.\n\n\n\nThe day before T. J. Lane shot five high-school students in Ohio, another high-school student was shot in Florida. The Orlando _Sentinel_ ran a three-paragraph story. On February 26th, seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin left a house in a town outside Orlando and walked to a store. He was seen by a twenty-eight-year-old man named George Zimmerman, who called 911 to report that Martin, who was black, was “a real suspicious guy.” Zimmerman got out of his truck. Zimmerman was carrying a 9-mm. pistol; Martin was unarmed. What happened next has not been established, and is much disputed. Zimmerman told the police that Martin attacked him. Martin’s family has said that the boy, heard over a cell phone, begged for his life.\n\n\n\nZimmerman shot Martin in the chest. Martin did not survive. Zimmerman was not charged. Outside Orlando, the story was not reported.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe day after the shooting in Ohio, I went to a firing range. I’d signed up for a lesson the week before. Once, when I was in Air Force R.O.T.C. for a year, I spent an afternoon studying how to defeat a sniper, but I’d never held a gun before.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American Firearms School sits in an industrial park just north of Providence, in a beige stucco building topped with a roof of mint-green sheet metal. From the road, it looks like a bowling alley, but from the parking lot you can tell that it’s not. You can hear the sound of gunfire. It doesn’t sound like thunder. It doesn’t sound like rain. It sounds like gunfire.\n\n\n\nInside, there’s a shop, a pistol range, a rifle range, a couple of classrooms, a locker room, and a place to clean your gun. The walls are painted police blue up to the wainscoting, and then white to the ceiling, which is painted black. It feels like a clubhouse, except, if you’ve never been to a gun shop before, that part feels not quite licit, like a porn shop. On the floor, there are gun racks, gun cases, holsters, and gun safes. Rifles hang on a wall behind the counter; handguns are under glass. Most items, including the rifles, come in black or pink: there are pink handcuffs, a pink pistol grip, a pink gun case, and pink paper targets. Above the pink bull’s-eye, which looks unnervingly like a breast, a line of text reads, “Cancer sucks.”\n\n\n\nThe American Firearms School is run by Matt Medeiros, a Rhode Island firefighter and E.M.T. Medeiros is also a leader of the Rhode Island chapter of Pink Heals, a nonprofit organization of emergency and rescue workers who drive pink fire trucks and pink police cars to raise money for cancer research and support groups. Last year, when Pink Heals opened a women’s center in West Warwick, Medeiros held a fund-raiser at the Firearms School.\n\n\n\nUnlike many firing ranges, which are private clubs, the American Firearms School is open to the public. Most mornings, federal, state, and local law-enforcement agencies, as well as private security firms, rent out the ranges for training and target practice. Classes, from beginner to advanced, are held in the afternoons, and are run by certified instructors.\n\n\n\nIn many states, to purchase a gun from a licensed dealer you need a permit, which requires you to complete firearms-safety training, not unlike driver’s education. But, even if all states required this, not everyone who buys a gun would have to take a class. That’s because forty per cent of the guns purchased in the United States are bought from private sellers at gun shows, or through other private exchanges, such as classified ads, which fall under what is known as the “gun-show loophole” and are thus unregulated.\n\n\n\nAt the American Firearms School, the Learn to Shoot program, for novices, costs forty dollars for ninety minutes: a lesson, a gun rental, range time, two targets, and two boxes of bullets. This doesn’t constitute sufficient instruction for a gun permit in the state, but the school offers a one-day, ninety-nine-dollar course that does: Basic Firearms Safety includes shooting fundamentals, a discussion of firearms law, and guidance in safe firearms storage.\n\n\n\nThe idea that every man can be his own policeman, and every woman hers, has necessitated revisions to the curriculum: civilians now receive training once available only to law-enforcement officers, or the military. A six-hour class on concealed carrying includes a lesson in “engaging the threat.” N.R.A. Basic Personal Protection in the Home teaches “the basic knowledge, skills, and attitude essential to the safe and efficient use of a handgun for protection of self and family” and provides “information on the law-abiding individual’s right to self-defense,” while N.R.A. Basic Personal Protection Outside the Home is a two-day course. A primer lasting three hours provides “a tactical look at civilian life.” This raises the question of just how much civilian life is left.\n\n\n\nAs I waited for my lesson, I paged through a stack of old magazines while watching Fox News on a flat-screen television. In Michigan and Arizona, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum were competing in that day’s Republican primaries. At the top of the hour came the headlines: in Ohio, Demetrius Hewlin had just died. For a tick, the news announcer fell silent. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/593b605aba20a654ac5d457e]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nI put down _Field and Stream_ and picked up _American Rifleman_, a publication of the N.R.A. The magazine includes a regular column called “The Armed Citizen.” A feature article introduced David Keene, the N.R.A.’s new president. Keene, who is sixty-six, is a longtime conservative political strategist. Grover Norquist once called him “a conservative Forrest Gump.” The 2012 Presidential election, Keene told _American Rifleman_, is “perhaps the most crucial election, from a Second Amendment standpoint, in our lifetimes.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe Second Amendment reads, “A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” Arms are military weapons. A firearm is a cannon that you can carry, as opposed to artillery so big and heavy that you need wheels to move it, or people to help you. Cannons that you can carry around didn’t exist until the Middle Ages. The first European firearms—essentially, tubes mounted on a pole—date to the end of the fourteenth century and are known as “hand cannons.” Then came shoulder arms (that is, guns you can shoulder): muskets, rifles, and shotguns. A pistol is a gun that can be held in one hand. A revolver holds a number of bullets in a revolving chamber, but didn’t become common until Samuel Colt patented his model in 1836. The firearms used by a well-regulated militia, at the time the Second Amendment was written, were mostly long arms that, like a smaller stockpile of pistols, could discharge only once before they had to be reloaded. In size, speed, efficiency, capacity, and sleekness, the difference between an eighteenth-century musket and the gun that George Zimmerman was carrying is roughly the difference between the first laptop computer—which, not counting the external modem and the battery pack, weighed twenty-four pounds—and an iPhone.\n\n\n\n\n\nA gun is a machine made to fire a missile that can bore through flesh. It can be used to hunt an animal or to commit or prevent a crime. Enough people carrying enough guns, and with the will and the training to use them, can defend a government, or topple one. For centuries before the first English colonists travelled to the New World, Parliament had been regulating the private ownership of firearms. (Generally, ownership was restricted to the wealthy; the principle was that anyone below the rank of gentleman found with a gun was a poacher.) England’s 1689 Declaration of Rights made a provision that “subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defence suitable to their condition and as allowed by law”; the Declaration was an attempt to resolve a struggle between Parliament and the Crown, in which Parliament wrested control of the militia from the Crown.\n\n\n\nIn the United States, Article VI of the Articles of Confederation, drafted in 1776 and ratified in 1781, required that “every state shall always keep up a well regulated and disciplined militia, sufficiently armed and accoutred, and shall provide and constantly have ready for use, in public stores, a due number of field pieces and tents, and a proper quantity of arms, ammunition and camp equipage.” In early America, firearms and ammunition were often kept in public arsenals. In 1775, the British Army marched to Concord with the idea of seizing the arsenal where the Colonial militia stored its weapons. In January of 1787, a Massachusetts resident named Daniel Shays led eleven hundred men, many of them disaffected Revolutionary War veterans, in an attempt to capture an arsenal in Springfield; they had been protesting taxes, but they needed guns and ammunition. Springfield had been an arsenal since 1774. In 1777, George Washington, at the urging of Henry Knox, made it his chief northern arsenal. By 1786, Springfield housed the largest collection of weapons in the United States. In the winter of 1787, the governor of Massachusetts sent the militia to suppress the rebellion; the Springfield arsenal was defended. That spring, the Constitutional Convention met in Philadelphia. Among the matters the delegates were to take up was granting to the federal government the power to suppress insurgencies like Shays’ Rebellion. From Boston, Benjamin Franklin’s sister Jane wrote to him with some advice for “such a Number of wise men as you are connected with in the Convention”: no more weapons, no more war. “I had Rather hear of the Swords being beat into Plow-shares, and the Halters used for Cart Roops, if by that means we may be brought to live Peaceably with won a nother.”\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Constitution, which was signed in Philadelphia in September of 1787, granted Congress the power “to provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions,” the power “to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress,” and the power “to raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years.”\n\n\n\nRatification was an uphill battle. The Bill of Rights, drafted by James Madison in 1789, offered assurance to Anti-Federalists, who feared that there would be no limit to the powers of the newly constituted federal government. Since one of their worries was the prospect of a standing army—a permanent army—Madison drafted an amendment guaranteeing the people the right to form a militia. In Madison’s original version, the amendment read, “The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country: but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.” This provision was made in the same spirit as the Third Amendment, which forbids the government to force you to have troops billeted in your home: “No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.”\n\n\n\nNone of this had anything to do with hunting. People who owned and used long arms to hunt continued to own and use them; the Second Amendment was not commonly understood as having any relevance to the shooting of animals. As Garry Wills once wrote, “One does not bear arms against a rabbit.” Meanwhile, militias continued to muster—the Continental Army was disbanded at the end of the Revolutionary War—but the national defense was increasingly assumed by the United States Army; by the middle of the nineteenth century, the United States had a standing army, after all. Harpers Ferry was the U.S. Army’s southern armory, Springfield its northern. In 1859, when John Brown and his men raided Harpers Ferry, they went there to get guns.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAt the American Firearms School, you can either rent a gun or bring your own. It’s like an ice-skating rink that way, except that renting skates when you don’t know how to skate is different from renting a gun when you don’t know how to shoot. The guys who work at the school don’t take any chances. In the twelve years since the school opened, there has never been an accident. “You can’t do anything here without us watching you,” Tom Dietzel told me. “In a swimming pool, there are lifeguards. And this place is a lot more dangerous than a swimming pool.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDietzel, who is twenty-four and has long dark hair, is one of the few instructors at the school who isn’t ex-military, ex-police, or ex-rescue. He led me to a classroom, opened a case, and took out a .22-calibre Mark III Target Rimfire pistol. Dietzel studied history in college, and on weekends he gives tours of the Freedom Trail, in Boston. We talked about the eighteenth-century portraits in the new wing of the Museum of Fine Arts; we debated the oratory of Joseph Warren. Dietzel owns a flintlock musket; he’s a Revolutionary War reënactor, with the Thirteenth Continental Regiment. He showed me a photograph of himself in costume: a cocked hat, a mustard-colored scarf of flax. He could have been painted by Gilbert Stuart.\n\n\n\nDietzel is a skilled and knowledgeable teacher, steady, patient, and calm. He had written safety rules on a whiteboard: Never point your gun at anyone. Keep your finger off the trigger. Don’t trust the safety. Assume every gun is loaded.\n\n\n\nHe explained how to load the magazine. “This is a semiautomatic,” he said. “After you fire, it will load the next bullet, but you have to pull the trigger again to fire. We don’t have automatics here.” Automatic weapons are largely banned by the federal government. “An automatic, you pull the trigger and it keeps shooting.” Dietzel shook his head. “Because: why? Why?”\n\n\n\nGun owners may be more supportive of gun-safety regulations than is the leadership of the N.R.A. According to a 2009 Luntz poll, for instance, requiring mandatory background checks on all purchasers at gun shows is favored not only by eighty-five per cent of gun owners who are not members of the N.R.A. but also by sixty-nine per cent of gun owners who are.\n\n\n\nDietzel rose. “Stand like a shortstop about to field a ball,” he said.\n\n\n\nHe showed me how to hold the .22.\n\n\n\nEvery day, Dietzel goes to work and, at some point, has to hand a gun to a perfect stranger who has never used one. He went over the rules again.\n\n\n\nWe got earplugs and headgear and ammunition and went to the range. I fired a hundred rounds. Then Dietzel told me to go wash my hands, to get the gunpowder off, while he went to clean the gun.\n\n\n\nThe halls at the American Firearms School are decorated with framed prints: Monet’s “Impression, Sunrise”; van Gogh’s “Irises.” A sign on the door of the women’s restroom reads, “Every Tuesday Is Ladies Night. Ladies Get *FREE*{: .small} Range Time from 5:00 *PM*{: .small} to 9:00 *PM*{: .small}.”\n\n\n\nI opened the door, and turned on the tap. T. J. Lane had used a .22-calibre Mark III Target Rimfire pistol. For a long time, I let the water run.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nOn March 8th, Trayvon Martin’s father, Tracy Martin, held a press conference in Orlando. “We feel justice has not been served,” he said. He demanded the release of recordings of calls to 911. “Family Wants Answers in Teen’s Death,” the Associated Press reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo days later, the biggest gun show in New England was held in West Springfield, Massachusetts, in an exposition center the size of an airport hangar. (Nationwide, there are about five thousand gun shows annually.) Early in the morning, men with guns lined up to have them inspected at the door: two policemen made sure that every gun was unloaded; a plastic bucket on the floor, half filled with sand, was for dumping ammunition, like the bin at airport security where T.S.A. officers make you chuck your toothpaste. Tickets cost eleven dollars, but there was no charge for children younger than twelve.\n\n\n\nInside was a flea market: hundreds of folding tables draped with felt tablecloths and covered with guns, along with knives, swords, and a great deal of hunting gear. Long guns stood on their stocks, muzzles up. Handguns rested under glass, like jewelry. “Cash for Guns,” the sign at the Tombstone Trading Company read. Ammunition was sold outdoors, in cartons, as in the fastener aisle of a hardware store. At the N.R.A. booth, membership came with a subscription to one of the N.R.A.’s three magazines, an N.R.A. baseball hat, twenty-five hundred dollars of insurance, “and the most important benefit of all—protecting the Constitution.”\n\n\n\nI stopped at the table of Guns, Inc., which advertises itself as the largest firearms dealer in western Massachusetts. Guns, Inc., is also an arsenal: a place where people who don’t want to keep their guns at home can pay to have them stored. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/593b605cba20a654ac5d4580]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the Springfield Armory grew to become the single biggest supplier of long arms to the U.S. Army. It shut its doors in 1968. A National Historic Site now, it houses about ten thousand weapons, most of which are shoulder arms. A sign on the door warns that no firearms are allowed inside. “People ask about that,” Richard Colton, a park ranger and the site’s historian, told me when I visited, “but we have plenty of guns here already.”\n\n\n\nThe story of the Springfield Armory illustrates a shift in the manufacture and storage of firearms: from public to private. In 1974, a family in Illinois founded a company devoted to arms manufacturing and import called Springfield Armory, Inc. The firm, “the first name in American firearms,” is one of the largest of its kind in the United States. Dennis Reese, the current C.E.O., and his brother Tom have staunchly opposed gun regulation. I asked Brian Pranka, of Guns, Inc., if he had any Springfield Armory guns. He said, “You can’t buy a Springfield handgun in Springfield.” The company does not make handguns that conform to all the gun-safety regulations in states like Massachusetts, New York, and California, and in Illinois they have lobbied the legislature, successfully defeating a state ban on assault weapons. In 2008, the Illinois State Rifle Association gave the Reeses the Defenders of Freedom Award.\n\n\n\nOn the first day of the Springfield gun show, Trayvon Martin’s parents appeared on “Good Morning America.” On March 19th, the Department of Justice, responding to growing protests, announced that it would conduct an investigation. On March 23rd, President Obama answered questions about the shooting at a press conference. “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon,” the President said. Later that day, Rick Santorum spoke outside a firing range in West Monroe, Louisiana, where he’d just shot fourteen rounds from a Colt .45. He told the crowd, “What I was able to exercise was one of those fundamental freedoms that’s guaranteed in our Constitution, the right to bear arms.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn the two centuries following the adoption of the Bill of Rights, in 1791, no amendment received less attention in the courts than the Second, except the Third. As Adam Winkler, a constitutional-law scholar at U.C.L.A., demonstrates in a remarkably nuanced new book, “Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America,” firearms have been regulated in the United States from the start. Laws banning the carrying of concealed weapons were passed in Kentucky and Louisiana in 1813, and other states soon followed: Indiana (1820), Tennessee and Virginia (1838), Alabama (1839), and Ohio (1859). Similar laws were passed in Texas, Florida, and Oklahoma. As the governor of Texas explained in 1893, the “mission of the concealed deadly weapon is murder. To check it is the duty of every self-respecting, law-abiding man.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough these laws were occasionally challenged, they were rarely struck down in state courts; the state’s interest in regulating the manufacture, ownership, and storage of firearms was plain enough. Even the West was hardly wild. “Frontier towns handled guns the way a Boston restaurant today handles overcoats in winter,” Winkler writes. “New arrivals were required to turn in their guns to authorities in exchange for something like a metal token.” In Wichita, Kansas, in 1873, a sign read, “Leave Your Revolvers at Police Headquarters, and Get a Check.” The first thing the government of Dodge did when founding the city, in 1873, was pass a resolution that “any person or persons found carrying concealed weapons in the city of Dodge or violating the laws of the State shall be dealt with according to law.” On the road through town, a wooden billboard read, “The Carrying of Firearms Strictly Prohibited.” The shoot-out at the O.K. Corral, in Tombstone, Arizona, Winkler explains, had to do with a gun-control law. In 1880, Tombstone’s city council passed an ordinance “to Provide against the Carrying of Deadly Weapons.” When Wyatt Earp confronted Tom McLaury on the streets of Tombstone, it was because McLaury had violated that ordinance by failing to leave his gun at the sheriff’s office.\n\n\n\nThe National Rifle Association was founded in 1871 by two men, a lawyer and a former reporter from the New York _Times_. For most of its history, the N.R.A. was chiefly a sporting and hunting association. To the extent that the N.R.A. had a political arm, it opposed some gun-control measures and supported many others, lobbying for new state laws in the nineteen-twenties and thirties, which introduced waiting periods for handgun buyers and required permits for anyone wishing to carry a concealed weapon. It also supported the 1934 National Firearms Act—the first major federal gun-control legislation—and the 1938 Federal Firearms Act, which together created a licensing system for dealers and prohibitively taxed the private ownership of automatic weapons (“machine guns”). The constitutionality of the 1934 act was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1939, in U.S. v. Miller, in which Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s solicitor general, Robert H. Jackson, argued that the Second Amendment is “restricted to the keeping and bearing of arms by the people collectively for their common defense and security.” Furthermore, Jackson said, the language of the amendment makes clear that the right “is not one which may be utilized for private purposes but only one which exists where the arms are borne in the militia or some other military organization provided for by law and intended for the protection of the state.” The Court agreed, unanimously. In 1957, when the N.R.A. moved into new headquarters, its motto, at the building’s entrance, read, “Firearms Safety Education, Marksmanship Training, Shooting for Recreation.” It didn’t say anything about freedom, or self-defense, or rights.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe modern gun debate began with a shooting. In 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald bought a bolt-action rifle—an Italian military-surplus weapon—for nineteen dollars and ninety-five cents by ordering it from an ad that he found in _American Rifleman_. Five days after Oswald assassinated President Kennedy, Thomas Dodd, a Democratic senator from Connecticut, introduced legislation restricting mail-order sales of shotguns and rifles. The N.R.A.’s executive vice-president, Franklin L. Orth, testified before Congress, “We do not think that any sane American, who calls himself an American, can object to placing into this bill the instrument which killed the president of the United States.”\n\n\n\n\n\nGun-rights arguments have their origins not in eighteenth-century Anti-Federalism but in twentieth-century liberalism. They are the product of what the Harvard law professor Mark Tushnet has called the “rights revolution,” the pursuit of rights, especially civil rights, through the courts. In the nineteen-sixties, gun ownership as a constitutional right was less the agenda of the N.R.A. than of black nationalists. In a 1964 speech, Malcolm X said, “Article number two of the constitutional amendments provides you and me the right to own a rifle or a shotgun.” Establishing a constitutional right to carry a gun for the purpose of self-defense was part of the mission of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, which was founded in 1966. “Black People can develop Self-Defense Power by arming themselves from house to house, block to block, community to community throughout the nation,” Huey Newton said.\n\n\n\nIn 1968, as Winkler relates, the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., gave the issue new urgency. A revised Gun Control Act banned mail-order sales, restricted the purchase of guns by certain high-risk people (e.g., those with criminal records), and prohibited the importation of military-surplus firearms. That law, along with a great deal of subsequent law-and-order legislation, was intended to fight crime, control riots, and solve what was called, in the age of the Moynihan report, the “Negro problem.” The regulations that are part of these laws—firearms restrictions, mandatory-sentencing guidelines, abolition of parole, and the “war on drugs”—are now generally understood to be responsible for the dramatic rise in the U.S. incarceration rate.\n\n\n\nThe N.R.A. supported the 1968 Gun Control Act, with some qualms. Orth was quoted in _American Rifleman_ as saying that although some elements of the legislation “appear unduly restrictive and unjustified in their application to law-abiding citizens, the measure as a whole appears to be one that the sportsmen of America can live with.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nDavid Keene, the N.R.A.’s president, is the former chairman of the American Conservative Union. In his office in Washington, he has a photograph of Ronald Reagan on the wall and a view of Pennsylvania Avenue out the window. Keene has white hair, blue eyes, and an air of plainspoken geniality. When he was eight or nine, he says, his grandfather taught him how to shoot by aiming a .22 at squirrels and rabbits.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeene’s parents were labor organizers. They never once voted for a Republican. “My first political activity was going door to door passing out pamphlets for J.F.K. in the snows of Wisconsin,” Keene told me. In the nineteen-fifties, he said, “Lionel Trilling considered conservatism to be a political pathology.” Keene became a conservative in high school, when he read “The Constitution of Liberty,” by Friedrich Hayek. In 1960, at the Republican National Convention, Barry Goldwater said, “Let’s grow up conservatives, if we want to take this party back, and I think we can someday. Let’s get to work.” Four years later, Keene volunteered for Goldwater’s campaign.\n\n\n\nAfter Goldwater’s defeat, Keene finished college and went on to law school. He became the national chairman of the Young Americans for Freedom. “What brought conservatism to dominance was the Great Society,” Keene argues, because Johnson’s vision represented “the culmination of the thinking that you could solve everything with money, and nothing worked.” Keene went to D.C. to work for Spiro Agnew, and then for Richard Nixon.\n\n\n\nOn Election Day in 1970, Keene was at the White House. Joseph Tydings, a Democratic senator from Maryland who had introduced a Firearms Registration and Licensing Act, was running for reëlection. “The returns were coming in, and someone said, ‘What’s going on in Maryland?’ ” Keene recalled. “And someone answered, ‘I can tell you this: everywhere except Baltimore, there are long lines of pickup trucks at the polls. He’s going down over gun control.’ ”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn the nineteen-seventies, the N.R.A. began advancing the argument that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual’s right to carry a gun, rather than the people’s right to form armed militias to provide for the common defense. Fights over rights are effective at getting out the vote. Describing gun-safety legislation as an attack on a constitutional right gave conservatives a power at the polls that, at the time, the movement lacked. Opposing gun control was also consistent with a larger anti-regulation, libertarian, and anti-government conservative agenda. In 1975, the N.R.A. created a lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action, headed by Harlon Bronson Carter, an award-winning marksman and a former chief of the U.S. Border Control. But then the N.R.A.’s leadership decided to back out of politics and move the organization’s headquarters to Colorado Springs, where a new recreational-shooting facility was to be built. Eighty members of the N.R.A.’s staff, including Carter, were ousted. In 1977, the N.R.A.’s annual meeting, usually held in Washington, was moved to Cincinnati, in protest of the city’s recent gun-control laws. Conservatives within the organization, led by Carter, staged what has come to be called the Cincinnati Revolt. The bylaws were rewritten and the old guard was pushed out. Instead of moving to Colorado, the N.R.A. stayed in D.C., where a new motto was displayed: “The Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms Shall Not Be Infringed.”\n\n \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/593b605e0f529324ac062b6e]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nRonald Reagan was the first Presidential candidate whom the N.R.A. had endorsed. David Keene ran Reagan’s Southern campaign. Reagan’s election, in 1980, made it possible for conservatives to begin turning a new interpretation of the Second Amendment into law. As the legal scholar Reva B. Siegel has chronicled, Orrin Hatch became the chair of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, and commissioned a history of the Second Amendment, which resulted in a 1982 report, “The Right to Keep and Bear Arms.” The authors of the report claimed to have discovered “clear—and long-lost—proof that the Second Amendment to our Constitution was intended as an individual right of the American citizen to keep and carry arms in a peaceful manner, for protection of himself, his family, and his freedoms.”\n\n\n\nIn March of 1981, John Hinckley, Jr., shot Reagan, the White House press secretary, James Brady, a D.C. policeman, and a Secret Service agent. He used a .22 that he had bought at a pawnshop. A month later, the _Times_ reported that Harlon Carter, then the N.R.A.’s executive vice-president, had been convicted of murder in Laredo, Texas, in 1931, at the age of seventeen. Carter had come home from school to find his mother distressed. She told him that three teen-age boys had been loitering nearby all afternoon, and that she suspected them of having been involved in stealing the family’s car. Carter left the house with a shotgun, found the boys, and told them that he wanted them to come back to his house to be questioned. According to the trial testimony of twelve-year-old Salvador Peña, Ramón Casiano, fifteen, the oldest of the boys, said to Carter, “We won’t go to your house, and you can’t make us.” Casiano took out a knife and said, “Do you want to fight me?” Carter shot Casiano in the chest. At Carter’s trial for murder, the judge, J. F. Mullally, instructed the jury, “There is no evidence that defendant had any lawful authority to require deceased to go to his house for questioning, and if defendant was trying to make deceased go there for that purpose at the time of the killing, he was acting without authority of law, and the law of self-defense does not apply.” Two years later, Carter’s murder conviction was overturned on appeal; the defense argued that the instructions to the jury had been improper.\n\n\n\nWhen the _Times_ broke the Casiano murder story, Carter at first denied it, saying the trial record concerned a different man with a similar name. He later said that he had “nothing to hide” and was “not going to rehash that case or any other that does not relate to the National Rifle Association.”\n\n\n\nJames Brady and his wife, Sarah, went on to become active in the gun-control movement, but neither the assassination attempt nor Carter’s past derailed the gun-rights movement. In 1986, the N.R.A.’s interpretation of the Second Amendment achieved new legal authority with the passage of the Firearms Owners Protection Act, which repealed parts of the 1968 Gun Control Act by invoking “the rights of citizens . . . to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment.” This interpretation was supported by a growing body of scholarship, much of it funded by the N.R.A. According to the constitutional-law scholar Carl Bogus, at least sixteen of the twenty-seven law-review articles published between 1970 and 1989 that were favorable to the N.R.A.’s interpretation of the Second Amendment were “written by lawyers who had been directly employed by or represented the N.R.A. or other gun-rights organizations.” In an interview, former Chief Justice Warren Burger said that the new interpretation of the Second Amendment was “one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word ‘fraud,’ on the American public by special-interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.”\n\n\n\nThe debate narrowed, and degraded. Political candidates who supported gun control faced opponents whose campaigns were funded by the N.R.A. In 1991, a poll found that Americans were more familiar with the Second Amendment than they were with the First: the right to speak and to believe, and to write and to publish, freely.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n“If you had asked, in 1968, will we have the right to do with guns in 2012 what we can do now, no one, on either side, would have believed you,” David Keene said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 1968 and 2012, the idea that owning and carrying a gun is both a fundamental American freedom and an act of citizenship gained wide acceptance and, along with it, the principle that this right is absolute and cannot be compromised; gun-control legislation was diluted, defeated, overturned, or allowed to expire; the right to carry a concealed handgun became nearly ubiquitous; Stand Your Ground legislation passed in half the states; and, in 2008, in District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court ruled, in a 5–4 decision, that the District’s 1975 Firearms Control Regulations Act was unconstitutional. Justice Scalia wrote, “The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia.” Two years later, in another 5–4 ruling, McDonald v. Chicago, the Court extended Heller to the states.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Keene says that all of these gains are fragile, because President Obama—who in his first term has not only failed to push for gun control but has signed legislation extending gun rights—has been hiding his true convictions. (From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the board of the Chicago-based Joyce Foundation, which funds pro-gun-control advocacy and research.) “If this President gets a second term, he will appoint one to three Supreme Court justices,” Keene says. “If he does, he could reverse Heller and McDonald, which is unlikely, but, more likely, they will restrict those decisions.”\n\n\n\nThis issue has been delivering voters to the polls since 1970. Conservatives hope that it will continue to deliver them in 2012. Keene, in his lifetime, has witnessed a revolution. “It’s not just the conservative political victories, the capture of the Republican Party, the creation of a conservative intellectual élite,” he said, “but the whole change in the way Americans look at government.” No conservative victories will last longer than the rulings of this Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nOne in three Americans knows someone who has been shot. As long as a candid discussion of guns is impossible, unfettered debate about the causes of violence is unimaginable. Gun-control advocates say the answer to gun violence is fewer guns. Gun-rights advocates say that the answer is more guns: things would have gone better, they suggest, if the faculty at Columbine, Virginia Tech, and Chardon High School had been armed. That is the logic of the concealed-carry movement; that is how armed citizens have come to be patrolling the streets. That is not how civilians live. When carrying a concealed weapon for self-defense is understood not as a failure of civil society, to be mourned, but as an act of citizenship, to be vaunted, there is little civilian life left.\n\n\n\nIn 2002, Keene’s son David Michael Keene was driving on the George Washington Memorial Parkway when, in a road-rage incident, he fired a handgun at another motorist. He was sentenced to ten years in prison for “using, brandishing, and discharging a firearm in a crime of violence.” I asked Keene if this private tragedy had left him uncertain about what the N.R.A. had wrought. He said no: “You break the law, you pay the price.”\n\n\n\nI asked Keene if any public atrocity had given him pause. He explained that it is the N.R.A.’s policy never to comment on a shooting.\n\n\n\nI asked him how he would answer critics who charge that no single organization has done more to weaken Americans’ faith in government, or in one another, than the N.R.A.\n\n\n\n“We live in a society now that’s Balkanized,” Keene said. “But that has nothing to do with guns.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nOn Monday, March 26th, thousands of students rallied in Atlanta, carrying signs that read, “I am Trayvon Martin,” and “Don’t Shoot!” One week later, in Oakland, a forty-three-year-old man named One Goh walked into Oikos University, a small Christian college. He was carrying a .45-calibre semiautomatic pistol and four magazines of ammunition. He grabbed Katleen Ping, a receptionist, and dragged her into a classroom. Nearby, Lucas Garcia, a thirty-three-year-old E.S.L. teacher, heard a voice call out, “Somebody’s got a gun!” He helped his students escape through a back door. Dechen Yangdon, twenty-seven, turned off the lights in her classroom and locked the door. She could hear Ping screaming, “Help, help, help!” “We were locked inside,” Yangdon said later. “We couldn’t help her.”\n\n\n\n\n\nGoh ordered the students to line up against the wall. He said, “I’m going to kill you all.”\n\n\n\nThey had come from all over the world. Ping, twenty-four, was born in the Philippines. She was working at the school to support her parents, her brother, two younger sisters, and her four-year-old son, Kayzzer. Her husband was hoping to move to the United States. Tshering Rinzing Bhutia, thirty-eight, was born in Gyalshing, India, in the foothills of the Himalayas. He took classes during the day; at night, he worked as a janitor at San Francisco International Airport. Lydia Sim, twenty-one, was born in San Francisco, to Korean parents; she wanted to become a pediatrician. Sonam Choedon, thirty-three, belonged to a family living in exile from Tibet. A Buddhist, she came to the United States from Dharamsala, India. She was studying to become a nurse. Grace Eunhea Kim, twenty-three, was putting herself through school by working as a waitress. Judith Seymour was fifty-three. Her parents had moved back to their native Guyana; her two children were grown. She was about to graduate. Doris Chibuko, forty, was born in Enugu, in eastern Nigeria, where she practiced law. She immigrated in 2002. Her husband, Efanye, works as a technician for A.T. & T. They had three children, ages eight, five, and three. She was two months short of completing a degree in nursing.\n\n\n\nPing, Bhutia, Sim, Choedon, Kim, Seymour, and Chibuko: Goh shot and killed them all. Then he went from one classroom to another, shooting, before stealing a car and driving away. He threw his gun into a tributary of San Leandro Bay. Shortly afterward, he walked into a grocery store and said, “I just shot some people.”\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday night, a multilingual memorial service was held at the Allen Temple Baptist Church. Oakland’s mayor, Jean Quan, said, “Oakland is a city of dreams.” A friend of Choedon’s said, “Mainly, we’re praying for her next life, that she can have a better one.” In Gyalshing, Bhutia’s niece, Enchuk Namgyal, asked that her uncle’s body be sent home to be cremated in the mountains above the village, across the world from the country where he came for an education, religious freedom, and economic opportunity, and was shot to death.\n\n\n\nKids in Chardon High are back in school. Nickolas Walczak is in a wheelchair. There are Trayvon Martin T-shirts. Oikos University is closed. The N.R.A. has no comment.\n\n\n\nIn an average year, roughly a hundred thousand Americans are killed or wounded with guns. On April 6th, the police found One Goh’s .45. Five days later, George Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder. In May, T. J. Lane will appear at a hearing. Trials are to come. In each, introduced as evidence, will be an unloaded gun. ♦","canonicalUrl":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/04/23/battleground-america","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1dc981ab3335f580f2a8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"(Pres.)

It hardly seems worth the energy to once again make the same essential point that the President—his growing exasperation and disbelief moving, if not effective, as he [serves as national mourner](http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/obamas-evolving-outrage-on-guns)—has now made again: _we know how to fix this_. Gun control ends gun violence as surely an antibiotics end bacterial infections, as surely as vaccines end childhood measles—not perfectly and in every case, but overwhelmingly and everywhere that it’s been taken seriously and tried at length. These lives can be saved. Kids continue to die en masse because one political party won’t allow that to change, and the party won’t allow it to change because of the [irrational and often paranoid fixations](http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/charleston-and-the-next-time) that make the massacre of students and children an acceptable cost of fetishizing guns.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the course of today’s conversation, two issues may come up, treated in what is now called a trolling tone—pretending to show concern but actually standing in the way of real argument. One is the issue of mental health and this particular killer’s apparent religious bigotry. Everyone crazy enough to pick up a gun and kill many people is crazy enough to have an ideology to attach to the act. The point—the only point—is that, everywhere else, that person rants in isolation or on his keyboard; only in America do we cheerfully supply him with military-style weapons to express his rage. As the otherwise reliably Republican (but still Canadian-raised) David Frum wisely writes: “Every mass shooter has his own hateful motive. They all use the same tool.”\n\n\n\nMore standard, and seemingly more significant, is the claim—often made by those who say they recognize the tragedy of mass shootings and pretend, at least, that they would like to see gun sanity reign in America—that the Second Amendment acts as a barrier to anything like the gun laws, passed after mass shootings, that have saved so many lives in Canada and Australia. Like it or not, according to this argument, the Constitution limits our ability to control the number and kinds of guns in private hands. Even the great Jim Jeffries, in [his memorable standup on American madness](http://www.vox.com/2015/3/24/8283199/gun-control-comedy-jefferies), says, “Why can’t you change the Second Amendment? It’s an amendment!”—as though further amending it were necessary to escape it.\n\n\n\nIn point of historical and constitutional fact, nothing could be further from the truth: the only amendment necessary for gun legislation, on the local or national level, is the Second Amendment itself, properly understood, as it was for two hundred years in its plain original sense. This sense can be summed up in a sentence: if the Founders hadn’t wanted guns to be regulated, and thoroughly, they would not have put the phrase “well regulated” in the amendment. (A quick thought experiment: What if those words were not in the preamble to the amendment and a gun-sanity group wanted to insert them? Would the National Rifle Association be for or against this change? It’s obvious, isn’t it?)\n\n\n\nThe confusion is contemporary. (And, let us hope, temporary.) It rises from the younger-than-springtime decision D.C. v. Heller_,_ from 2008, when Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for a 5–4 majority, insisted that, whether he wanted it to or not, the Second Amendment protected an individual right to own a weapon. (A certain disingenuous show of disinterestedness is typical of his opinions.)\n\n\n\nThis was an astounding constitutional reading, or misreading, as original as Citizens United, and as idiosyncratic as the reasoning in Bush v. Gore, which found a conclusive principle designed to be instantly discarded—or, for that matter, as the readiness among the court’s right wing to overturn a health-care law passed by a supermajority of the legislature over a typo. Anyone who wants to both grasp that decision’s radicalism and get a calm, instructive view of what the Second Amendment does say, and was intended to say, and was always before been understood to say, should read Justice John Paul Stevens’s [brilliant, persuasive dissent](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZD.html) in that case. Every person who despairs of the sanity of the country should read it, at least once, not just for its calm and irrefutable case-making but as a reminder of what sanity sounds like.\n\n\n\nStevens, a Republican judge appointed by a Republican President, brilliantly analyzes the history of the amendment, making it plain that for Scalia, et al., to arrive at their view, they have to reference not the deliberations that produced the amendment but, rather, bring in British common law and lean on interpretations that arose long after the amendment was passed. Both “keep arms” and “bear arms,” he demonstrates, were, in the writers’ day, military terms used in military contexts. (Gary Wills has usefully illuminated this truth [in the _New York Review of Books_](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1995/sep/21/to-keep-and-bear-arms/).) The intent of the Second Amendment, Stevens explains, was obviously to secure “to the people a right to use and possess arms in conjunction with service in a well-regulated militia.” The one seemingly sound argument in the Scalia decision—that “the people” in the Second Amendment ought to be the same “people” referenced in the other amendments, that is, everybody—is exactly the interpretation that the preamble was meant to guard against.\n\n\n\n[Stevens’s dissent](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZD.html) should be read in full, but his conclusion in particular is clear and ringing:\n\n> \n> \n> The right the Court announces [in Heller] was not “enshrined” in the Second Amendment by the Framers; it is the product of today’s law-changing decision. . . . Until today, it has been understood that legislatures may regulate the civilian use and misuse of firearms so long as they do not interfere with the preservation of a well-regulated militia. The Court’s announcement of a new constitutional right to own and use firearms for private purposes upsets that settled understanding . . .\n\n\n\nJustice Stevens and his colleagues were not saying, a mere seven years ago, that the gun-control legislation in dispute in Heller alone was constitutional within the confines of the Second Amendment. They were asserting that essentially _every kind of legislation_ concerning guns in the hands of individuals was compatible with the Second Amendment—indeed, that regulating guns in individual hands was one of the purposes for which the amendment was offered.\n\n\n\nSo there is no need to amend the Constitution, or to alter the historical understanding of what the Second Amendment meant. No new reasoning or tortured rereading is needed to reconcile the Constitution with common sense. All that is necessary for sanity to rule again, on the question of guns, is to restore the amendment to its commonly understood meaning as it was articulated by this wise Republican judge a scant few years ago. And all you need for that is one saner and, in the true sense, conservative Supreme Court vote. One Presidential election could make that happen.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-second-amendment-is-a-gun-control-amendment","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cb3ee7fe02cbd163384","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Crime","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"crime"},{"id":"5c2e1c7bb75f002c8941e470","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Gun Control","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"gun-control"},{"id":"5c2e1cb22bc86f2c9a2449f7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Gun Violence","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"gun-violence"},{"id":"5c2e1ea02710c62d1081561b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Massacres","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"massacres"},{"id":"5c2e1dca81ab3335f580f2ab","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"National Rifle Association (N.R.A.)","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"national-rifle-association-nra"},{"id":"5c2e1c762710c62d10815407","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"},{"id":"5c2e1c8d22d4972cd5b832b0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Second Amendment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"second-amendment"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909ff4b1c7a8e33fb390bbb","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Adam Gopnik, a staff writer, has been contributing to *The New\nYorker* since 1986.

The person who recruited her promised that, if she worked for a few years, she could leave with enough money to help her family build a new house and start a better life in Indonesia. Her salary would be only a hundred and fifty dollars a month, but job opportunities in Indonesia were scant, so she accepted, and her recruiter arranged a tourist visa. When she arrived in L.A., though, her employer confiscated her passport. Matul lived in a corner of the family room in her employer’s home, cooking and cleaning for up to eighteen hours a day, without pay; if her work didn’t meet certain standards, her employer beat her. Her tourist visa soon expired. Because she spoke very little English and didn’t know anything about the U.S. immigration system, she had no idea where she would go if she did manage to leave the house. Her employer told her that, if she went to the police, she would be arrested. But, after three years, Matul had learned enough English to write a letter asking for help, and she gave the letter to a neighbor’s nanny.\n\nMatul imagined that, after escaping, she would work illegally until she could afford a plane ticket back to Indonesia. She couldn’t fathom a way to stay in the United States. The neighbor, though, took her to *CAST*{:.small}, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit that helps survivors of trafficking. Workers there told her that she could apply for a T visa, which is designed for victims like her. It took Matul a moment to understand what they meant. “I didn’t even know I had been trafficked,” she told me. Matul got the visa, then a green card, and, eventually, U.S. citizenship. She now works for *CAST*{:.small}, as the coördinator of its Survivor Leadership Program, which gives survivors of trafficking a platform to help and advocate for others who are escaping similar situations. In 2015, she also helped form the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking, a board composed of eleven survivors, which helps the President shape anti-trafficking legislation. In 2016, she spoke at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nIt is difficult to determine the prevalence of trafficking in the U.S. because there is no single reliable source for statistics; experts rely on hotlines, court cases, and, in the case of non-citizen victims, visa applications to collect data. Since 2000, when the T-visa program began, thousands of people have applied, and the number of yearly applicants has steadily increased as victims and advocates have become more aware of the program. (The same is true for U visas, which are designed for victims of general crimes and are now so frequently requested that they have a [fifty-month](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/) waiting period.) The T visa has proved to be a reliable safety net for survivors of trafficking, and no viable alternative exists for those who are rejected or don’t apply.\n\nTrump has tried to establish himself as a crusader against trafficking. The issue is bipartisan, appealing equally to left-leaning labor reformers and evangelical Christians. In October, 2018, Trump was the first President to address an interagency task-force meeting on trafficking. “Our country will not rest until we have put these vile organizations out of business and rescued every last victim,” he said in his speech. In an op-ed published last November, in the Washington *Post*, Ivanka Trump touted the President’s appearance at the task-force meeting as one of his many accomplishments. In January (which is National Slavery and Human-Trafficking Prevention Month), Trump held a roundtable discussion, in Texas, in which he made reference to human trafficking, claiming that building a border wall would “stop it cold.” Later in the month, as he defended the government shutdown, Trump relied on one of his preferred images of trafficking: women being smuggled across the southern border, “tied up, with duct tape on their faces, put in the backs of vans.” \n\nThis is a false characterization of the problem. According to data from the Department of Justice, in 2017, roughly two-thirds of the trafficking victims who were served by organizations that received funding from the Office for Victims of Crime were U.S. citizens. Among non-citizens, illegal border-crossing is not typically the issue. “Most of the victims we work with come in on perfectly good visas,” Martina Vandenberg, the founder and president of the Human Trafficking Legal Center, told me. This mischaracterization is part of a cynical strategy that uses trafficking to bolster arguments for harsh immigration policies and also makes it more difficult for non-citizen victims to remain safely in the U.S. Last year, despite having originally exempted people who were applying for humanitarian visas, the Administration announced that, beginning in mid-November, applicants who are denied T visas may be required to appear in immigration court, the first step in deportation proceedings. Because the change was presented as a separate, almost dully bureaucratic shift in the rules, officials have an easy defense: the T-visa program itself has not changed, Michael Bars, a spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, stressed in e-mails. But this is one of a few ostensibly minor changes the Trump Administration has made to the system that have already had an outsized impact on the trafficking community.\n\nIn the past two months, I have spoken to lawyers, advocates, and victims—and I’ve heard the testimonies of non-citizen victims through their lawyers and advocates when they were too scared to speak themselves—who report a chilling effect. Since the rule changed, in November, Vandenberg hasn’t filed an application for a single T visa. “At this point, you have to ask yourself whether it is ethical to apply for a visa when you’re putting your client in danger of deportation,” she said. Dilcia Molina, who works at a Washington, D.C.,-based nonprofit called La Clínica del Pueblo, told me that she recently counselled a Salvadoran woman who had been impregnated by her trafficker and was desperate for an abortion. “She says, ‘Please don’t ask me to apply for a T visa. I saw on TV that the President hates people looking for visas or asylum,’ ” Molina recalled. As a result, victims who once freed themselves from  trafficking with the support of the U.S. government are now being forced to choose between staying with their traffickers or escaping to a life of working illegally and avoiding immigration authorities. “For eighteen years”—since Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act—“we have built a system that is the envy of the world for treating trafficking survivors humanely,” Vandenberg said. “The Trump Administration has managed to tear it down in two years.”\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nWhen Trump was elected, advocates were reasonably confident that anti-trafficking legislation was strong enough and had enough support in Congress and government agencies to endure even the most capricious Presidency. Though protections like the Trafficking Victims Protection Act remain intact (Trump reauthorized the law last month), the Administration’s influence has been more insidious. Since the beginning of Trump’s term, even before the change in November, advocates for victims of trafficking had begun to notice changes in the process. Applicants for T visas who entered the country illegally are sometimes required to pay a nine-hundred-and-thirty-dollar filing fee to request that the government excuse their illegal entry. Under past Administrations, the fee was regularly waived if the victims were unable to pay. “Over the summer, these fee waivers were being rejected across the board,” Lori Cohen, the director of an anti-trafficking initiative at Sanctuary for Families, told me. “Trafficking victims were being asked to provide tax receipts to prove income. Guess what, brothels don’t provide tax receipts to trafficking victims. Johns don’t give receipts for services received.”\n\nThe Administration is also threatening to make life more dangerous for non-citizen trafficking victims in subtler ways. In September of last year, the President proposed “public charge” legislation that would penalize both immigrants who have received government assistance and emigrants applying for entrance to the U.S. who seem likely to need assistance in the future. The law would spare humanitarian-visa applicants entirely, and it would also spare some humanitarian-visa holders applying to adjust their immigration status, but it wouldn’t do so automatically; visa-holders would have to apply for a waiver, which would be adjudicated by U.S.C.I.S. “They have debt, medical issues, mental-health issues, lost employment, no credit history, and now they are being told, ‘If you access public benefits, you may end up being deported,’ ” Jean Bruggeman, the executive director of the anti-trafficking coalition Freedom Network USA, said. “But if they don’t access them, they are likely to go back into the underground economy, where, once again, they will be trafficked. It’s like telling survivors of domestic violence, ‘Here are these lovely shelters; if you come and stay in one, we will deport you.’ ”\n\nSince Trump’s announcement in November, advocates have noticed that, after receiving applications for T visas, immigration authorities have begun asking that the victims and their lawyers provide further proof that the applicants were trafficked. “We would very rarely get requests for more evidence,” Katherine Soltis, an attorney at an immigrant-services nonprofit in Washington, D.C., called Ayuda, said. “Now it’s nearly every case.” Authorities are even more likely to scrutinize cases when clients committed crimes during their time in captivity. “There has been a dramatic shift in T-visa applicants getting requests for further evidence based on arrest history,” Sabrina Talukder, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society in New York, told me. A year ago, she met a client who had been trafficked after she ran away from an abusive home life. “Her story is very common among L.G.B.T.Q. youth,” Talukder said. “It’s made more complicated because she is undocumented. People won’t hire her, and so she’s vulnerable and at risk of being trafficked again in order to survive.” Talukder explained to the client that, because she had been arrested for petty crimes connected to her trafficking, she would almost certainly receive a request for more evidence, which would lead to  scrutiny of her record and the strong possibility that her application would be denied and she would be deported. Decisions are discretionary, leaving lawyers and victims uncertain about why they were denied and what that denial means for future applications. Considering the risk, the client decided not to apply for a T visa. “Congress has stated, in reauthorizing the T.V.P.A., that L.G.B.T.Q. youth are at particular risk,” Talukder told me. “This is designed for her in so many ways. It’s horrifying.” \n\nLast year, the Department of Justice announced that certain grants that were provided by the Office for Victims of Crime, and that organizations used to help people clear their criminal records, can no longer be used for that purpose. The O.V.C. still funds anti-trafficking projects, but for many victims who emerged from trafficking having committed crimes that were directly part of their trafficking, like prostitution, or that were tangential to it, like loitering or theft, that legal service was crucial to their recovery. Criminal records keep victims from coming forward, or, if they do come forward, prevent them from getting jobs, affordable housing, and, crucially, visas and green cards. The O.V.C. grants allowed lawyers to do the difficult, intricate work of applying, often in a variety of jurisdictions, to vacate records. This change, another ostensibly minor one, is sure to make the lives of citizen and non-citizen victims of trafficking harder and more dangerous. “It’s very punitive and targeted,” Jessica Emerson, a lawyer who works with the Survivor Reëntry Project, a group that helps trafficking victims vacate their records, said. “The thinking is that criminals are criminals. And we don’t do anything to help criminals.” When I spoke to Emerson, she and her colleague Kate Mogulescu were at a conference, training other lawyers on the process for filing records to be vacated; both their work and the conference itself relied on O.V.C. funding.\n\nScaling back these services isn’t just cruel; it’s shortsighted. Programs that help victims of trafficking—in particular, T visas—are indispensable tools for the U.S. government in its efforts to stop trafficking. The majority of successful trafficking prosecutions involve victims who provide evidence and testimony with the hope—almost a guarantee under previous Administrations—that they will receive protection and services to help them. Through the application process for T visas, victims are encouraged, but not obliged, to aid in the investigation of their traffickers, which leads to more prosecutions and better statistics. “Our clients come forward and provide extremely detailed information about how the rings operated, where they lived, where they frequented—detailed information that then helped Homeland Security develop a robust case that the Justice Department could prosecute,” Cohen said. Now she thinks twice before recommending her clients as witnesses. “Before, if they told us they would be deported or targeted if they came forward, we could tell them, ‘That’s not true,’ ” Cohen said. “Now we can’t.”\n\nTrump often cites prosecutions that have occurred under his Administration as evidence of his fight against trafficking. In the lead-up to Trump’s trip to the border, the Department of Justice (breaking its shutdown-caused silence) tweeted two press releases about the prosecution and sentencing of men involved in the Rendon-Reyes ring, a trafficking group of mostly Mexican nationals that was first broken up in 2013, during the Obama Administration. Talukder, from Legal Aid, represents one of the victims of the Rendon-Reyes ring. After the victim came forward, in 2014, her story followed a once-typical narrative: she testified against her traffickers, which made it impossible for her to go back to Mexico and live among their friends and family, and then received a T visa, which allowed her to stay in the U.S. Since the rule change in November, Talukder has applied for half of the T visas that she normally would have.\n\nTrafficking thrives in the shadows, so, for now, the impact of these changes might be only perceptible to the victims and the advocates who work with those victims. It will take many months before the chill around T visas is reflected in U.S.C.I.S. statistics, and, without any definitive data available on the extent of trafficking in the U.S., it will remain difficult to gauge its long-term effects. That’s one of the reasons that Trump is able to present himself as a champion of survivors despite experts raging against him and his policies. This week, the White House announced that one of Trump’s guests at his State of the Union address, on Tuesday, will be a human-trafficking investigator from the Department of Homeland Security. Advocates are worried about how the President will frame the issue. “All of us working on human trafficking, we are tired of being the Trump Administration’s fig leaf,” Vandenberg said.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nOn Wednesday, survivors across the country began fielding requests from the Blue Campaign, the D.H.S.’s human-trafficking outreach and prevention project. The D.H.S. was looking for a survivor to attend a press conference on trafficking with the President on Friday, and they were very clear about who they wanted. “They asked for a survivor who had crossed the southern border,” Nat Paul, a survivor of human trafficking and a human-rights advocate, told me. (A spokesperson for the D.H.S. declined to comment.)\n\nUntil recently, Paul was part of the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking under Trump; she had been recruited by the State Department to represent the L.G.B.T.Q. community. In November, though, she resigned, citing, among other things, the Administration’s habit of using her “dead name” (the name she was given at birth) and her rising concern that non-citizen victims had become targets for deportation. She was quick to praise the remaining members (and the State Department officials who had recommended her), but she had felt ignored in D.C.; one conservative senator, she told me, dismissed the Council as “only victims.” Matul had also tried to remain hopeful when Trump was elected, but she did not remain on the Council. “I don’t know if I could work with an Administration that doesn’t have the same values I have,” she told me. Evelyn Chumbow, an inaugural member who is originally from Cameroon, also resigned, citing her worry that the Administration doesn’t care about the disproportionate effect that trafficking has on people of color. “Americans would be ashamed to know that there are Africans and African-Americans still being sold into slavery,” she said. \n\nSome survivors of trafficking work closely with government projects like the Blue Campaign; they have to constantly negotiate their advocacy work with those government programs with their concerns about the President’s rhetoric. As news of the proposed meeting spread through the survivor community, it set off alarms. “Our concern was that the White House would use the trafficking issue to get funding for the wall,” Matul said. Paul was similarly worried. “We wanted to find a strong and experienced advocate who would not play into the myth of a duct-taped woman thrown into a trunk,” she told me. Survivors passed along a name: Suamhirs Piraino-Guzman, a Honduran-American man who had previously served on the Council. He ticked some of the Administration’s boxes: he was from Central America; he had been sexually exploited; and he had crossed the southern border. In other, important ways, he defied Trump’s portrayal of trafficking. Piraino-Guzman wasn’t bound and hidden in the back of a car. When he was fourteen, traffickers brought him through an official port of entry with forged documents; he was drugged and put on display so that U.S. border authorities would think that he was sick and let him through. That trick worked for the next six months, during which Piraino-Guzman was transported legally, with documents, through airports around the country. He was drugged, sold, and raped an estimated two hundred times. \n\nEven if advocates wanted to give Trump his perfect survivor, they would have had a difficult time finding one. The image conveyed by Trump is not a complete fiction, but it comes close. “I have talked to others at Freedom Network who have provided services for hundreds of survivors in the U.S., and none of us know someone who fits that profile,” Bruggeman told me. “We know people who came in on legal visas. We know people who paid smugglers and then crossed the border and then were sold to traffickers. People come across the border in various ways, but no one has any familiarity with anyone who came in bound and gagged.” And among non-citizens, labor trafficking is as much a concern as sex trafficking. “We have huge cases, ten or fifteen or twenty people coming here on temporary work visas,” Matul told me. “They are coming here to work, and they end up being trafficked.” \n\nWhen Paraino-Guzman was approached about the request, he told me, “My first thought was no way in hell. These people are trying to use a survivor story to make a pro-wall argument.” Then he thought it over; he is supportive of the Blue Campaign’s goals, and he thought that something productive might come out of a meeting. “If I don’t go and provide the correct and experience-based narrative, they are going to find someone whose message can be manipulated,” he said. Paraino-Guzman told the D.H.S. that he was interested, but he set some guidelines. He would have to speak—“If they just want a photo op, I won’t be there,” he said—and he wanted more information before he agreed to go. “I asked questions,” he said. “What are you planning to do? Why do you have so many specific requests about the survivor?” \n\nWhile waiting for the D.H.S.’s decision, Piraino-Guzman read a Fox News op-ed by Timothy Ballard, a former D.H.S. agent who went on to found the anti-trafficking group Operation Underground Railroad. Ballard’s group has long drawn criticism for its tactics, which involve elaborate stings. When Piraino-Guzman read Ballard’s op-ed, titled “I’ve Fought Sex Trafficking as a D.H.S. Special Agent. We Need to Build the Wall for the Children,” he said, “My blood boiled. This organization says they are protectors of kids, and here you are pushing a narrative that puts kids in danger.” He made his opinion known on Twitter: “What a disgusting display,” he wrote. “As a sex trafficking survivor that was brought to this country, a wall won’t stop traffickers. I was brought in through an actual POE and the traffickers used false documents. stop trying to make a wall argument based on horrible, racist information.” Five minutes later, a D.H.S. representative sent an e-mail saying, politely, that Piraino-Guzman wouldn’t be needed on Friday. “It was weird,” he said. \n\nSurvivor-less, Trump doubled down on his narrative about trafficking and the wall. He held his press conference, and, afterward, the White House released a fact sheet that uses actual numbers to present a mostly imaginary vision of trafficking across the border. It notes that, during a migrant’s journey, he or she is at grave risk of sexual assault and violence, which readers might mistakenly conflate with sex trafficking. It cites a decrease in illegal border crossings in parts of the country that include a physical barrier, making no attempt to show how many, among those who crossed the borders, were victims of trafficking. The only data point on the fact sheet that specifically describes trafficking is the number of arrests made by *ICE*{:.small} and Homeland Security: fifteen hundred and eighty-eight in 2018. The sheet does not elaborate on those arrests, other than to point out that, among them, only forty-five were for labor trafficking. These figures mean little without context. They reflect arrests in the U.S., but not specifically of people who crossed the border illegally. And the fact that the vast majority of arrests were for sex trafficking does not mean that labor trafficking is less prevalent; it just means that it’s less of a priority for law-enforcement officials. Nearly all federal criminal prosecutions of traffickers are for sex trafficking, while nearly all civil cases are for labor trafficking. Those victims exist; they just can’t get the Trump Administration to see them.  \n\nMatul often thinks about what her life would be like if she had been sold into slavery in America in 2017 rather than in 1997. Would she have been brave enough to write that letter asking for help? Would she, after listening to a *CAST*{:.small} lawyer­ outline the new risks of applying for a T visa, have done so anyway? Would she have been on the Council? Would any such Council exist? “At *CAST*{:.small}, they told me that, under U.S. law, no one could not pay me for the work that I do, or abuse me, even though I was illegal,” she said. “I can’t imagine how I would feel today—to be scared of my trafficker and scared of being deported.”\n\n*This article was supported by the [Fuller Project for International

week, evidence was presented which you may find helpful if you’re still trying to assess [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)’s rationale for his border wall. Along with bigness and elemental beauty, he credits it with crime-stopping powers: in particular, he says, it will stanch the flow of drugs that feed our country’s raging opioid habit. In his prime-time address to the nation, on January 8th, Trump told Americans that “our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.” Without a wall, he tweeted on January 11th, “Criminals, Gangs, Human Traffickers, Drugs & so much other big trouble can easily pour in. It can be stopped cold!” \n\nOne of the proceedings was the case that the Massachusetts attorney general filed against Purdue Pharma, the company that produced the powerful opioid painkiller OxyContin, along with some of the company’s directors and eight members of the [Sackler family](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain), which owns it. For years, the Sacklers, an art-loving, philanthropic clan, have represented themselves as hands-off proprietors, who were unaware of both the dangers of OxyContin and Purdue’s aggressive marketing of it. (In 2007, Purdue and three current and former top executives, none of them Sacklers, pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges of misleading the public about the addiction risks of OxyContin, and paid $634.5 million in fines.) But a court filing released last week disclosed the exulting of one family member, Richard Sackler, that OxyContin would create “a blizzard of prescriptions,” which he predicted would be “dense, deep and white.” It also contained his recommendation, in an e-mail, “to hammer on abusers in every way possible”—on people, in other words, who had become dependent on a drug that was extremely addictive, and, thanks in large part to Purdue’s assurances that it was not, was wildly overprescribed. The case was a reminder than an opioid epidemic that is largely responsible for lowering life expectancy in the United States for the first time since 1980 began quite legally, with a drug manufactured not by a Mexican cartel but by an American pharmaceutical company.\n\nThe second proceeding was the trial of Joaquín ([El Chapo](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/21/kate-del-castillo-sean-penn-and-el-chapo)\\) Guzmán Loera, the suspected leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel, which has been under way in New York since early November. This week, a former high-ranking associate of Guzmán’s, named Jesús Zambada García, was testifying about the cartel’s business practices. Asked how it typically smuggled drugs into the United States, Garcia explained that Mexican drug traffickers rely mainly on vehicles driven through official border checkpoints. They used illicit tunnels under the border in the early nineteen-nineties, he explained, but, after the tunnels were detected and closed, they turned to hiding narcotics in legitimate-looking shipments of canned goods and the like. Sometimes they transported them by sea, smuggling drugs in fishing boats or dispatching them in submersibles. One stratagem they did not apparently resort to was sneaking across the Mexican border *between* checkpoints—the gaps that a wall would fill. \n\nThis testimony comported with what Daniel Ciccarone, a researcher who heads the [Heroin in Transition project](https://globalprojects.ucsf.edu/project/heroin-transition) at the University of California, San Francisco, had told me. If you’re going to put money into drug interdiction—an endless task, he said, given how nimble and persistent the cartels are in responding to demand—“Where are you going to get the most bang for your buck? Is it going to be stopping a person hiking through the desert to get to Texas? Or is it going to be stopping trucks?” He answered his own question: “The tonnage is coming in through trucks and cars that go through border checkpoints—so put the money there.” (The compromise bill on border security that the Democratic-led House passed on January 3rd does just that, allotting additional funds to “non-intrusive inspection devices” at ports of entry.)\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Agency’s [2018 National Drug Threat Assessment](https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/DIR-032-18%202018%20NDTA%20final%20low%20resolution.pdf) underlines the point: the majority of the heroin that gets across the southwest border, which is indeed where most heroin enters the United States, comes in privately owned cars, trucks, and tractor-trailers “entering the United States at legal ports of entry.” (Cocaine predominantly arrives in vehicles at official points of entry as well, according to the D.E.A, though commercial air travel is another route.) \n\nThe opioid epidemic appeared in three waves, starting in the nineteen-nineties: the first was of prescription pills, mainly OxyContin; the second was of heroin, which replaced pills for some opioid-addicted people, once new prescribing practices and less abusable formulations rendered pills less available; and the most recent took the form of fentanyl and other synthetics, which are cheaper to produce than heroin and fifty times more potent. Ciccarone and his U.C.S.F. colleague Sarah Mars have conducted research showing that the fentanyl wave is a product more of supply than of demand. Most users don’t particularly want fentanyl—they know the risks of overdosing on a much stronger drug—but it’s what’s available now. And it is often branded and sold in powder form as heroin, or formed into counterfeit pills, making it difficult for users and even street-level sellers to know what they’ve got.\n\nFentanyl is used for medical purposes, such as pain relief in cancer and epidurals in childbirth, and is manufactured above-board in this country, where it is a classified as a controlled substance. But illicit fentanyl, which is now at the leading edge of overdose deaths in the United States, has a much more complicated provenance. According to the D.E.A., most of it is made in clandestine laboratories in China. Though some is then smuggled in across the southwest border, much of it is mailed or shipped. Last June, at the port of Philadelphia, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents seized a hundred and ten pounds of fentanyl that was concealed in a shipment of iron oxide from China. (Alerted by a narcotic-sniffing dog, the agents tested the substance with a handheld isotype-analysis tool.) Paul Knierim, the D.E.A.’s deputy chief of operations for the office of global enforcement, testified last September, at a congressional subcommittee hearing titled “[Tackling Fentanyl: The China Connection](https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2018-09/DEA%20Testimony%20-%20China%20and%20Fentanyl%20HFAC_0.pdf),” that “China is one of the world’s top producers of the precursor chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine and fentanyl.” When the D.E.A. takes action to ban the import of certain chemicals, “Clandestine chemists can easily continue developing and synthesizing new synthetic opioids that do not appear on any schedule of controlled substances,” Knierim said, sometimes in a matter of weeks. “Sadly, these substances are often first discovered when D.E.A. receives reports from local hospitals and coroners in connection with a spate of overdoses.” He added that, because of its potency, “one kilogram of fentanyl purchased in China” carries the potential of “being lethal for five hundred thousand people.”\n\nThe fact that only small amounts of fentanyl are needed to supply a very large population makes detecting and disrupting imports that much harder, Mars told me. This is even more the case with fentanyl substitutes such as carfentanil, a synthetic opioid that is a hundred times more powerful (it’s used as a tranquilizer for elephants and horses) that has begun to turn up in the U.S. heroin supply over the past few years.\n\nFentanyl is also increasingly sold on the dark Web, using cryptocurrency. In August, a joint investigation by the D.E.A., the Department of Justice, the F.B.I., *ICE*{:.small}, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, called Operation Darkness Falls, led to the arrest of a San Antonio couple, Matthew and Holly Roberts, who allegedly ran dark-Web marketplaces for fentanyl and other drugs. The San Antonio *Express-News* [described them](https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/An-ordinary-couple-who-drove-raggedy-cars-13197479.php) as “an ordinary couple” who taught themselves how to conduct their drug trafficking online, disguising it behind a mail-order business for glow bracelets. (They later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and other crimes.)\n\nIn some ways, the Robertses’ D.I.Y. entrepreneurship and alertness to market trends are very much of our time. The conditions of modern capitalism (from the free and constant flow of goods across borders to the advent of Bitcoin) and the iron law of prohibition (once a drug is banned, another one or another means of procuring it will fill the void) are very good for drug trafficking. Smart interdiction of drugs can make a difference, but you have to be thinking about what will replace the drug whose supply you are cutting off, and whether it might be worse. And, in any case, a wall isn’t smart interdiction.\n\nIn the end, it’s an old story: you can’t really stop drugs unless you stop people from using drugs. In the case of the opioid epidemic, we need greater availability of, less squeamishness about, and more funding for medication-assisted treatments, such as buprenorphine, naltrexone, and methadone. And we need better mental-health care for people who are self-medicating their emotional pain with opioids. Ciccarone told me, “I meet police chiefs who have the right hearts and the right brains. They come in and say, ‘I need to address childhood trauma and other root causes if I want to address drugs and crime.’ They have a long view, and that’s what we need. We should be making a more resilient society—treating the pathos that the drugs are a response to. After twenty years of doing drugs research, I still believe that’s possible.” If only we had a President who agreed with him.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ea32396212cbb9fcb7a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Opioid Crisis","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"opioid-crisis"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a41c92e2c9b85da19","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Border Wall","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"border-wall"},{"id":"5c2e2c64aef5062c9d94ad3a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Joaquín Guzmán Loera (El Chapo)","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"joaquin-guzman-loera-el-chapo"},{"id":"5c2e1ca7397f5b30646d0628","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Purdue Pharma","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"purdue-pharma"},{"id":"5c2e1dcfb75f002c8941e5d9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration Law","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration-law"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a033f2179605b11ad996f","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Margaret Talbot joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2003.\nPreviously, she was a contributing writer at the New York *Times\nMagazine* and, from 1995 to 1999, an editor at *The New Republic.* Her\nstories, covering legal issues, social policy, and popular culture, have\nappeared, in addition to in the *Times Magazine* and *The New\nRepublic,* in *The Atlantic Monthly, National Geographic,* and\nthe *Times Book Review*.

Still defiant and tweeting several hours later, the President went on to brag about the thousands of additional troops being sent to the southern U.S. border to combat an “attempted Invasion of Illegals.” Never mind that there is no such invasion, or that the troops will be there to spread concertina wire and not to fire bullets at the nonexistent rampaging hordes; if Trump says it’s true, it must be. After all, he became President.\n\nThose tweets on Thursday morning were among dozens that Trump has sent out since last week, a period of time in which he was confined inside the White House, making no public appearances beyond a few photo ops and leaving the building only once, for a private fund-raiser at his Trump International Hotel. This is, even by the President’s standards, an epic stretch of brooding, and no wonder: the truth at the moment is pretty terrible for President Trump. Of course he is waging war on it.\n\nTrump suffered the worst defeat of his Presidency when, after single-handedly shutting down a large part of the federal government for more than a month in order to demand billions of dollars in funding for his border wall, he was forced to end the shutdown without getting a single dollar. (This has been misportrayed in some accounts as a “deal” with congressional Democrats; it was not a deal—Trump, losing support from Republicans to keep the government shut down, simply caved.) The same day, the F.B.I. [arrested](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/25/opinions/most-important-sentence-roger-stone-indictment-avlon/index.html) Roger Stone, one of Trump’s oldest political associates and the first person who believed Trump could, and would, become President someday. Stone now faces up to forty-five years in prison, on charges that he secretly coördinated with WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign on the release of Russian-hacked Democratic e-mails from the 2016 Presidential campaign and then lied to Congress about it. \n\nIt’s hardly surprising that, in the days since his shutdown humiliation, Trump has retreated into the virtual seclusion of Twitter, holed up watching cable news and tweeting his alternative reality as America struggles with an actual deep freeze. For Trump, the fake world is much better than the real one. There is no extreme weather in his White House; in fact, climate change does not exist inside its walls. Trump’s policy has decreed it. He’s avoiding more than just the frigid air outside; in the cocoon of the Oval Office, there are only invited guests and staff who, while they may be secretly leaking unflattering accounts, at least have the good sense to be nice to Trump’s face. In recent days, the Democratic Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, has compared Trump to a petulant toddler and openly wondered what Russia has on him. Why would Trump want to spend his time negotiating with her? Much better, from Trump’s point of view, to simply announce, as he did to reporters on Thursday, that “Nancy Pelosi will be begging for a wall,” and spend the day with his own press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who this week told an interviewer that God “wanted Donald Trump to become President.” \n\nOn Wednesday, Trump created another mini-furor by openly disputing the intelligence assessments of his own government. A day earlier, his spy chiefs had testified to Congress about their annual global-threats report, and it was lost on no one that [their findings clashed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-trump-trying-to-bully-americas-intelligence-agencies-into-silence) mightily with the key assumptions underpinning the President’s approach to Iran, North Korea, and *ISIS*{:.small}. Trump seemed to have missed the testimony, but he caught the negative TV coverage, and his tweets Wednesday burned with anger at the officials he had appointed. They were “extremely passive and naive,” he tweeted, and hadn’t a clue about the great success of his major foreign-policy initiatives. Trump was rightfully barraged with criticism from the fact-based community; in response, he hauled the unhappy-looking spy chiefs in for an Oval Office photo op on Thursday and blamed the media for misreporting their televised testimony. “We are all on the same page!” he tweeted. But neither Trump nor the intelligence community backed down a bit on the substance of the controversy, even as it perfectly distilled this low moment in Trump’s Presidency: with reality looking so grim, why not pretend to live in a world where North Korea is disarming, Iran is the deal-breaker, and a big, beautiful, soon-to-be-built wall is defending us from the southern invaders? Anything can be true in a world where God himself made you President and everybody who disagrees with you is wrong.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nOf course, it is already a well-established truth that the Trump Presidency has been replete with reality-distorting lies. According to the Washington *Post’s* Fact Checker, the President made 7,645 false or misleading claims over the first seven hundred and ten days of his term, for an average rate of eleven per day. That total is as of December 30th, which means it does not account for the blizzard of fakery kept up by Trump through much of the thirty-five-day government shutdown and a subsequent week of post-shutdown spin. \n\nFrom the beginning, the question was not whether Trump would lie but what the rest of Washington would do about it. And, on that point, I have long been struck by how successful Trump seems to be at getting others to go along with previously unthinkable plans (and in getting rid of those who do not). That “invasion” from the south may be fake, but those are real troops that the Pentagon agreed to send to the border just days before last fall’s midterm elections; it is now sending more than three thousand additional U.S. soldiers, for a deployment whose total cost, officials testified this week, will exceed six hundred million dollars by September. How is this not a bigger deal? We have deployed thousands of troops, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, for a nakedly political fake war, to combat an “invasion” on U.S. soil that does not exist. This has gone well beyond tweets.\n\nAnd yet Sanders is far from the only remaining true believer in Trump. In the hours after the intelligence chiefs’ testimony, the faithful at Fox News defended the President against his treacherous subordinates, especially the director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats. “What the hell is wrong with the D.N.I.?” the Fox Business host Lou Dobbs, a longtime confidant of Trump, demanded. In response, his guest Fred Fleitz, a former senior official on Trump’s National Security Council, said that Coats should be fired. “Intelligence&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is not supposed to second-guess Presidential policy,” he said.\n\nFleitz, who served as a C.I.A. analyst for nineteen years before briefly becoming the chief of staff on Trump’s N.S.C., last year, was sticking with that line the next day, when I called him to ask about the incendiary segment. Coats “crossed the line,” he told me, by “undermining the President in a public setting and grandstanding.” Still, Fleitz wanted to be clear, he wasn’t against intelligence analysts disagreeing with Trump but against the fact that they were doing so in public. He added, “I’ve been reading all kinds of things on the Internet that sound like I disagree with intelligence analysts that provide analysis that goes against the President. I don’t. I’m against public spectacles that are trying to judge the President’s policy, that are going to undermine the President’s policy.” For Trump’s embattled supporters, we may be reaching the shoot-the-messenger phase of the Presidency.\n\nStill, there have been signs in recent days, if embryonic ones, that Trump’s shutdown debacle has weakened him politically, even among the previously loyal Republicans of Capitol Hill. “Trump administration faces an increasingly adversarial Congress—in both parties,” a Washington *Post* headline read on Wednesday night. On Thursday, the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, pressed ahead with a rare measure to rebuke Trump for aspects of his foreign policy, specifically the planned military withdrawals from Afghanistan and Syria. And McConnell, embarrassed by Trump’s shutdown ploy, which came over his objections, was reported to have told members that he would be open to a measure to stop such shutdowns from ever being allowed in the future. \n\nThis is even before Congress receives a report from the special counsel, Robert Mueller, whose investigation, the acting Attorney General, Matthew Whitaker, told reporters this week, is almost complete. Events may be closing in on the President. Indictments and convictions and the Mueller report, whatever it is and whenever it is delivered, will be harder for Republicans on Capitol Hill to dismiss than much of the bluster that preceded them. Which is why I think the recent shift in the congressional G.O.P.’s mood is significant. \n\nTo be clear: these folks may still vote with Trump, they may stick with him to the finish, and they will undoubtedly continue to use him opportunistically for their policy ends. But they do not love him, and many will abandon him if pragmatism and the politics of the moment demand it. This is true not only of the typically treacherous members of Congress, who invariably prioritize their own political survival over their fealty to the President. In the Trump era, even the loyalty of the President’s own men is suspect, another fact we were reminded of this week, by the latest tell-all books to emerge with titillating scenes of internal dysfunction in Trumpworld. “[Team of Vipers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/125022389X),” by [Cliff Sims](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/cliff-sims-is-proud-to-have-served-trump), whose bio says he served as “director of White House message strategy” for Trump, is one of the most damning insider accounts yet. Sims is currently on his book tour, saying he was proud to work for Trump while portraying the White House as a pit of self-interested snakes unleashed and encouraged by the President himself. A book that shows the most powerful man in the world demanding that a relatively junior aide help him to make an enemies list of possible leakers on his own staff is not the flattering work of an admirer. No wonder an angry Trump couldn’t be restrained from tweeting vitriol at Sims the other day. \n\nAnother self-professed fan of the President, the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, also has a new book out this week. Despite being fired as the chief of Trump’s transition team, in 2016, Christie has remained an outside adviser and confidant to Trump. And yet there he was, on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” on Tuesday night, sipping tequila as he mocked Trump for a loser shutdown. “The President blew it,” Christie said. At what point? Colbert asked Christie. “When he shut the government down with no plan on how to reopen it,” Christie replied. And this was from one of Trump’s most vocal supporters. If ever there was a week when the truth hurt, this was it. \n\nAmid all the noise, a striking finding from the latest Washington *Post*–ABC News poll did not get much attention: fifty-six per cent of registered voters said they would “definitely” *not* vote to reëlect the President in 2020. Of course, this is neither a promising number for Trump nor comparable to any electoral environment that other recent Presidents have faced. In fact, Trump is the first President since Gallup began taking its national surveys, in 1935, never to have commanded a majority approval rating in the country even once.
