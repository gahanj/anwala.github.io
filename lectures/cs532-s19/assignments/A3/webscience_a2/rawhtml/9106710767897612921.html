The group believed that Martin, a housewife, had received a message from a planet named Clarion that the world would end in a great flood beginning at midnight, and that they, the faithful, would be rescued by an alien spacecraft.</span></p><aside id="recirc-0" class="recirc-most-popular pull-right pull-small hide"></aside><p>Unbeknownst to the other “Seekers,” three of their group—Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken, and Stanley Schachter—were not there to be saved, but to observe. Psychologists from elite institutions, they had infiltrated the pseudo-cult to study Festinger’s recently elaborated theory of “cognitive dissonance.” The theory predicted that when people with strongly held beliefs were presented with contrary evidence, rather than change their minds they would seek comfort and “cognitive consonance” by convincing others to support their erroneous views.<span> </span></p><p>Festinger’s prediction was right. When neither the apocalypse nor the UFO arrived, the group began proselytizing about how God had rewarded the Earth with salvation because of their vigil. His subsequent book, <i><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/When-Prophecy-Fails/Leon-Festinger/9781625589774" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">When Prophecy Fails</a></i>, became a standard sociology reference for examining cognitive dissonance, religious prophecy, and cult-like behavior. What the three researchers probably never predicted, though, was that over half a century later Festinger’s theory would be applicable to roughly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/nbc-wsj-poll-trump-s-support-has-gotten-deeper-not-n880851" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">25 percent</a> of the population of the United States and one of its two major political parties.

These days there is no shortage of articles and books dealing with radical-right populism, despots, democratic backsliding, and the tactics that authoritarian leaders deploy. Dozens of experts have pointed out that liberal democratic institutions need constant attention and reinforcement in order to be effective bulwarks. But most of the solutions on offer are institutional in nature: maintaining the independence of the judiciary, thwarting a would-be autocrat’s attempts to grab hold of the levers of justice, maintaining a legislative check on executive authority, enshrining political norms more clearly into constitutions.</span></p><p><span class="None">In their 2011 book, <i><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/comparative-politics/defeating-authoritarian-leaders-postcommunist-countries?format=HB&amp;isbn=9781107006850" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Defeating Authoritarian Leaders in Post-Communist Countries</a></i>, Valerie Bunce and Sharon Wolchik conclude that democratization in Eastern European nations like Croatia owed much to assistance from transnational pro-democracy networks, civil society, and energetic election campaigns run by a united opposition. In some ways this analysis offers us a modicum of hope: Trump, despite his desires, commands far less power over the political system than did any of the autocrats that Bunce and Wolchik studied, and the United States enjoys many of the elements they cite as critical, like robust civil society, energetic elections, and a mostly unified opposition.

He argued that outsiders should work with mid-level members of the community who could simultaneously engage ordinary people and their leaders. He also called for an “elicitive approach” whereby solutions were developed by people themselves, in accordance with their own specific cultural contexts.</span><span> </span></p><p><span class="None">Of the places in the world where conflict transformation has worked, Northern Ireland probably most approximates the United States, in the sense that it was part of a wealthy nation with a democratic tradition (though in the 1980s, Northern Ireland was in a far worse situation of political division and communitarian violence).</span><span> </span></p><p><span class="None">Maria Power, a researcher in conflict transformation studies at Oxford, sees strategies from Northern Ireland that could be deployed on the other side of the Atlantic.

She said that the peace effort in Northern Ireland hinged on incredibly tough, person-to-person groundwork carried out by dozens of organizations and ecumenical groups. She emphasized above all the importance of investing effort and time into building trust, first within, and then later between, identity groups.</span><span> </span></p><p><span class="None">Power said that conflict transformation in the United States would likely involve local, grassroots community development in the areas that Trump likes to hold rallies. “I don’t mean that progressives should go to these communities and start knocking on doors,” she explained, “that would be the worst thing that could happen to exacerbate tensions. I mean that there should be a focus on real community development in these areas.”</span></p><p><span class="None">Individuals would be led through a “single identity dialogue,” a safe-space where someone who has gained the community’s trust can guide them through discussion of their identity, why they feel threatened, and why they feel the need to <i>otherize</i> those they see as different.

But there is reality, and there is perception, and the truth is that Trump voters <i>perceive </i>themselves as victims who have been culturally dislocated, disdained, and in danger of being left behind.</span></p><p><span class="None">Power said that, in the mid-1980s, Northern Ireland had some 300 of these single-identity groups. She added that there was a tough balance to strike between allowing people “to become comfortable enough with their own place in society that other people don’t seem to be a threat,” and “dripping” in truth in such a way that avoided a reinforcement of their existing beliefs.</span></p><p><span class="None">Only once that step had been undertaken on a local level were people able to have cross-community conversation, and eventually to engage with each other through social action projects—schemes to bring people together, not over political discussion, but in tasks beneficial to their communities.

Elfversson told me that because trust in the state and institutions is often crucial to reconciliation, democratic backsliding in the U.S. is worrying. “Important work to overcome divides is done at the grassroots level—through NGOs, religious initiatives, social service programs, schools, at the workplace, etc.,” she said, adding, “Civil society organizations that cut across identity borders can promote reconciliation and reduce conflict.”</span></p><aside class="pullquote pull-right">The problem for the modern left is that none of this is emotionally satisfying.

Why should a group that still enjoys the momentum of historic privilege, and is still afforded outsize political weight, be handheld through an era of demographic change? And why should minority groups, who continue to suffer from oppression, be the ones to extend that hand?</span></p><hr class="section-break"><p>American politics, as Alexis de Tocqueville once observed, has often had a religious character to it, with the nation itself exalted in a messianic way. After the end of the Vietnam War, Thomas Robbins and Dick Anthony, two researchers of cults, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1042698.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Abab8e1ef646b3c5e5ba54810f6809e3f&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">wrote</a>, “There is a recurrent sequence in American history in which sectarian (and sometimes rather authoritarian) religions emerge and elicit tremendous hostility.” The decline of Cold War orthodoxy after Vietnam, the two noted, had produced a crisis in American civil religion, resulting in “the proliferation of cults as well as the growth of anticult demonology.” </p><p><span class="None">We can understand Donald Trump’s rise as a civil religion giving way to its cultic expression. Con man, cult leader, populist politician: Trump is all of these, rolled into one. He has become all-encompassing, even to nonbelievers. We all feel the fatigue of merely existing in the Trump era, the rapid-fire assault on all of our political and social senses. We want immediate solutions to the Trump problem. We want to beat reason into his followers, until they recognize how wrong they are, or at the very least, submit. We want to blame them—justifiably—for perpetuating his sham.</span><span> </span></p><p><span class="None">I want these things. I want them in my <i>gut</i>. But I also know that the cult’s pull is so powerful that it risks destroying its opponents, by eliciting a counterproductive reaction to it. If we want to bring members of the Trump cult back into the mainstream of American life—and there will be plenty of those who say we should move on without them—resistance means not only resisting the lure of the cult and exposing its lies, but also resisting the temptation to punish its followers.</span></p><p><span class="None">“When the cultic behavior is on a national scale, [breaking it up] is going to take a national movement,” Lalich <a href="https://psmag.com/news/a-sociologist-explains-the-similarities-between-cults-and-trumps-gop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">says</a>.

The group believed that Martin, a housewife, had received a message from a planet named Clarion that the world would end in a great flood beginning at midnight, and that they, the faithful, would be rescued by an alien spacecraft.<\/span><\/p><p>Unbeknownst to the other \u201cSeekers,\u201d three of their group\u2014Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken, and Stanley Schachter\u2014were not there to be saved, but to observe. Psychologists from elite institutions, they had infiltrated the pseudo-cult to study Festinger\u2019s recently elaborated theory of \u201ccognitive dissonance.\u201d The theory predicted that when people with strongly held beliefs were presented with contrary evidence, rather than change their minds they would seek comfort and \u201ccognitive consonance\u201d by convincing others to support their erroneous views.<span> <\/span><\/p><p>Festinger\u2019s prediction was right. When neither the apocalypse nor the UFO arrived, the group began proselytizing about how God had rewarded the Earth with salvation because of their vigil. His subsequent book, <i><a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/When-Prophecy-Fails/Leon-Festinger/9781625589774\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">When Prophecy Fails<\/a><\/i>, became a standard sociology reference for examining cognitive dissonance, religious prophecy, and cult-like behavior. What the three researchers probably never predicted, though, was that over half a century later Festinger\u2019s theory would be applicable to roughly <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/nbc-wsj-poll-trump-s-support-has-gotten-deeper-not-n880851\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">25 percent<\/a> of the population of the United States and one of its two major political parties. Nor could they have foreseen that the country\u2019s salvation might well depend on its ability to deprogram the Trump cult\u2019s acolytes\u2014an effort that would require a level of sympathetic engagement on the part of nonbelievers that they have yet to display.<\/p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Personality cults are a hallmark of populist-autocratic politics. The names of the various leaders are practically synonymous with their movements: Le Pen, Farage, Duterte, <span>Orb\u00e1n<\/span><span>, Erdogan, <\/span><span>Ch\u00e1vez<\/span><span>, Bolsonaro, Putin. Or if we were to dip farther back into history: Castro, Franco, Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin. Like religious cult leaders, demagogues understand the importance of setting up an in-group/out-group dynamic as a means of establishing their followers\u2019 identity as members of a besieged collective.<\/span><\/p><p>Trump, like the populist authoritarians before and around him, has also understood (or, at least, instinctually grasped) how indispensable his own individual persona is to his ultimate goal of grasping and maintaining power. Amidst his string of business failures, Trump\u2019s singular talent has been that of any con man: the incredible ability to cultivate a public image.

These days there is no shortage of articles and books dealing with radical-right populism, despots, democratic backsliding, and the tactics that authoritarian leaders deploy. Dozens of experts have pointed out that liberal democratic institutions need constant attention and reinforcement in order to be effective bulwarks. But most of the solutions on offer are institutional in nature: maintaining the independence of the judiciary, thwarting a would-be autocrat\u2019s attempts to grab hold of the levers of justice, maintaining a legislative check on executive authority, enshrining political norms more clearly into constitutions.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"None\">In their 2011 book, <i><a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/comparative-politics/defeating-authoritarian-leaders-postcommunist-countries?format=HB&amp;isbn=9781107006850\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Defeating Authoritarian Leaders in Post-Communist Countries<\/a><\/i>, Valerie Bunce and Sharon Wolchik conclude that democratization in Eastern European nations like Croatia owed much to assistance from transnational pro-democracy networks, civil society, and energetic election campaigns run by a united opposition.

When it comes to Trump, he told me that rather than pursuing impeachment, which could backfire by polarizing institutions and the general environment even more, \u201cthe opposition needs to focus on strengthening institutions of checks and balances, and embracing and defending policies that produce majoritarian consensus rather than just cater to the base.

He argued that outsiders should work with mid-level members of the community who could simultaneously engage ordinary people and their leaders. He also called for an \u201celicitive approach\u201d whereby solutions were developed by people themselves, in accordance with their own specific cultural contexts.<\/span><span> <\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"None\">Of the places in the world where conflict transformation has worked, Northern Ireland probably most approximates the United States, in the sense that it was part of a wealthy nation with a democratic tradition (though in the 1980s, Northern Ireland was in a far worse situation of political division and communitarian violence).<\/span><span> <\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"None\">Maria Power, a researcher in conflict transformation studies at Oxford, sees strategies from Northern Ireland that could be deployed on the other side of the Atlantic. She cited the example of dialogue-building between Unionist and Republican women, who faced much tougher obstacles to reconciliation since they were \u201crisking their lives\u201d every time they met in East Belfast during <\/span><span class=\"Hyperlink1\"><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/troubles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Troubles<\/a><\/span><span class=\"None\">. She said that the peace effort in Northern Ireland hinged on incredibly tough, person-to-person groundwork carried out by dozens of organizations and ecumenical groups. She emphasized above all the importance of investing effort and time into building trust, first within, and then later between, identity groups.<\/span><span> <\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"None\">Power said that conflict transformation in the United States would likely involve local, grassroots community development in the areas that Trump likes to hold rallies. \u201cI don\u2019t mean that progressives should go to these communities and start knocking on doors,\u201d she explained, \u201cthat would be the worst thing that could happen to exacerbate tensions. I mean that there should be a focus on real community development in these areas.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"None\">Individuals would be led through a \u201csingle identity dialogue,\u201d a safe-space where someone who has gained the community\u2019s trust can guide them through discussion of their identity, why they feel threatened, and why they feel the need to <i>otherize<\/i> those they see as different. This does presume some legitimacy to their fears; as <i>The Atlantic<\/i>\u2019s Adam Serwer, among others, has <\/span><span class=\"Hyperlink0\"><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/the-nationalists-delusion/546356/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">written convincingly<\/a><\/span><span class=\"None\">, Trumpism is not primarily a story of globalism\u2019s dispossessed, but rather one of identity politics.

She added that there was a tough balance to strike between allowing people \u201cto become comfortable enough with their own place in society that other people don\u2019t seem to be a threat,\u201d and \u201cdripping\u201d in truth in such a way that avoided a reinforcement of their existing beliefs.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"None\">Only once that step had been undertaken on a local level were people able to have cross-community conversation, and eventually to engage with each other through social action projects\u2014schemes to bring people together, not over political discussion, but in tasks beneficial to their communities. Power lamented that overall this is quite a long-term process, perhaps even a generational one.<\/span><\/p><p><span class=\"None\">That sentiment was echoed by Emma Elfversson, who researches peace and conflict at Sweden\u2019s Uppsala University. Elfversson told me that because trust in the state and institutions is often crucial to reconciliation, democratic backsliding in the U.S. is worrying. \u201cImportant work to overcome divides is done at the grassroots level\u2014through NGOs, religious initiatives, social service programs, schools, at the workplace, etc.,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cCivil society organizations that cut across identity borders can promote reconciliation and reduce conflict.\u201d<\/span><\/p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\">The problem for the modern left is that none of this is emotionally satisfying.
