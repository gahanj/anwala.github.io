target="_blank">attended a lunch event at the Time Warner Center in Manhattan</a>. The keynote speaker at the event was Henry Kissinger, the former national security adviser to Richard Nixon who has subsequently met 17 times with Vladimir Putin. The lunch was organized by the Center for the National Interest, a foreign policy think tank once known as the Nixon Center, whose head, the Russian-born Dimitri Simes, had been friendly with the eponymous U.S. president — and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">is</em> friendly with the current Russian president.</p><p name="2c8e" id="2c8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the time, Kushner was a bit player in the Trump campaign. He’d come aboard in November 2015, just four months before, and was nominally in charge of the campaign’s social media operations, which would not take off until June 2016, when supercharged by Cambridge Analytica. If he was known at all, it was as the husband of Ivanka Trump.</p><p name="00c6" id="00c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The 14 March lunch is significant, because it is the first known contact between Kushner and representatives of Russian president Vladimir Putin. For Dimitri Simes was not just the head of a think tank and publisher of a periodical, the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">National Interest</em>, that trumpeted pro-Putin views. He was also, <a href="https://english.gordonua.com/news/exclusiveenglish/who-is-dimitri-simes-and-why-is-he-trying-to-sink-mayflower-investigation-by-yuri-felshtinsky-316154.html" data-href="https://english.gordonua.com/news/exclusiveenglish/who-is-dimitri-simes-and-why-is-he-trying-to-sink-mayflower-investigation-by-yuri-felshtinsky-316154.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">allegedly</a>, one of the highest-ranking Russian intelligence operatives in the United States. He’d met with Putin in Moscow not long before that lunch.</p><p name="1b7e" id="1b7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Born in Moscow in 1947, the son of a prominent civil rights lawyer, Simes attended prestigious schools. After graduating in 1970, he worked at Institute of World Economy and International Relations, where as deputy secretary of the Institute’s <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Komsomol</em> Committee he became politically active. He gave frequent lectures at the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party, where his favorite topic was the failure of U.S.-style capitalism. The Communist rising star quit this post in 1972/3, in order to immigrate to Israel, as many Soviet Jews were then doing.</p><p name="ba19" id="ba19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But Simes never made it to Jerusalem.

As <a href="https://english.gordonua.com/news/exclusiveenglish/who-is-dimitri-simes-and-why-is-he-trying-to-sink-mayflower-investigation-by-yuri-felshtinsky-316154.html" data-href="https://english.gordonua.com/news/exclusiveenglish/who-is-dimitri-simes-and-why-is-he-trying-to-sink-mayflower-investigation-by-yuri-felshtinsky-316154.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the historian Yuri Felshtinsky writes in GORDON</a>:</p><blockquote name="4df9" id="4df9" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">What was it that Simes told (or did not tell) to the US officials in the US Embassy in Rome in 1973 when applying for the US visa, is not known. It seems unlikely that he was telling him about his Komsomol leadership activities and that his departure was sanctioned by Evgeny Primakov, a long-time KGB official and a future Head of the Foreign Intelligence Service.</blockquote><p name="0b1a" id="0b1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">By the end of 1973, Simes was living in Washington. Leveraging some highly influential conservative political contacts, he wangled a job at the prestigious Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Ten years later, he’d become a close associate of Richard Nixon, and an informal adviser to the former president on the Soviet Union. After Nixon died, Simes established the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom, which later changed its name to the Center for the National Interest. Simes’ advice, as Felshtinsky notes, is always a variation on the same theme: “Russia has a lot of nukes, so it’s better to be friends than enemies. Engagement is key.” This is exactly the position advocated by Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator who traveled to Russia last year to hand-deliver a letter from Trump to Putin — which makes perfect sense, as <a href="https://freebeacon.com/politics/rand-pauls-russian-connection/" data-href="https://freebeacon.com/politics/rand-pauls-russian-connection/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Paul has been an associate of Dimitri Simes for years</a>.</p><p name="b3e2" id="b3e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another Simes BFF is Richard Burt, a Reagan-era State Department official with long ties to Russia. Burt, who sits on the Russian Alfa Bank advisory board, was allegedly a key player in the changing of the Republican party’s platform to soften the party’s stance on Ukraine.</p><p name="7643" id="7643" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the most notorious of Simes’ associates, whose pro-Trump/Russia screed <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-bear-the-elephant-13098?page=0%2C1" data-href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-bear-the-elephant-13098?page=0%2C1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“The Bear and the Elephant”</a> he published in the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">National Interest</em> in 2015, is the self-styled “founding chairman [of] The Right To Bear Arms, a Russian version of the NRA” — Maria Butina.</p><p name="ddc9" id="ddc9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Soon after Butina’s indictment, Simes fled the United States.

Over the next several months, a gaggle of prominent Moscow agents would ingratiate themselves into the Trump campaign, and especially into the orbit of Kushner and his brother-in-law, Donald Trump, Jr.</p><p name="cc25" id="cc25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Two weeks to the day later, the campaign would enlist the help of Paul Manafort, the onetime Republican operative who, twenty years earlier, had cut his teeth as a GOP convention broker. During those two decades spent away from convention-brokering, however, Manafort had spent most of his time with a host of unsavory characters: despots, mostly, from foreign dictatorships — and, more recently, a pair of shady Russian oligarchs, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/donald-trump-campaign-paul-manafort-ukraine-yanukovich" data-href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/16/donald-trump-campaign-paul-manafort-ukraine-yanukovich" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Oleg Deripaska and Dmytro Firtash</a>. His most recent client, Viktor Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine, was a particularly noxious fellow. All three men were thick as thieves with Vladimir Putin. When Manafort joined the Trump campaign on 28 March 2016, he was millions of dollars in debt to Deripaska. His allegiance was to Moscow, not to Washington; certainly he was not interested in Making America Great Again.</p><p name="4837" id="4837" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To that end, Manafort helped assemble Trump’s foreign policy team, which included two alleged Russian assets: George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, both of whom were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/11/13/all-of-the-known-times-the-trump-campaign-met-with-russians/?utm_term=.de6e4cbff47b" data-href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/11/13/all-of-the-known-times-the-trump-campaign-met-with-russians/?utm_term=.de6e4cbff47b" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">already in contact with Moscow</a>.

(Later, Kislyak would visit the Oval Office, where he and his colleague Sergei Lavrov, allegedly Simes’ Kremlin handler, would be photographed laughing it up with their asset, Donald Trump).</p><figure name="75f2" id="75f2" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 466px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.60000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Rnxj_bIv7FH21rAkVVo8Xw.jpeg" data-width="710" data-height="473" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*Rnxj_bIv7FH21rAkVVo8Xw.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Rnxj_bIv7FH21rAkVVo8Xw.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Kislyak, the Russian ambassador and spymaster, is on the right.

On that date, Trump was scheduled to give a speech at the National Press Club. Kushner — almost certainly at the behest of Manafort, Kislyak, and Simes — changed the venue at the last minute to the Mayflower Hotel, a larger space that would allow the Russian ambassador to attend, in violation of protocol, and permit schmoozing after the speech.</p><p name="02fb" id="02fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The new event was organized and hosted by the Center for the National Interest, which is to say, by the alleged Russian agent Dimitri Simes — at Kushner’s request, per the latter’s own Congressional testimony. It was Trump’s first major foreign policy speech. Richard Burt had a hand <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trumps-russia-connections-foreign-policy-presidential-campaign/" data-href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trumps-russia-connections-foreign-policy-presidential-campaign/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">in its writing</a>, as did George Papadopoulos. In the speech, the candidate promised “a good deal” for Russia, while dutifully refraining from any criticism of Vladimir Putin. But the message was clear. Trump may as well have said, “When I meet Putin in Helsinki, I will kiss his ring.”</p><p name="60d7" id="60d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The attendees at the Mayflower event form an overlapping Venn diagram with a Robert Mueller “Persons of Interest” list: Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, Donald Trump, Jr., then-senator Jeff Sessions, J.D. Gordon, Devin Nunes, Bud McFarlane, Richard Burt, Corey Lewandowski, Hope Hicks, George Papadopoulos. (Note how many of these individuals were interviewed by Mueller and/or the Congressional committees, and how many are already convicted.)</p><p name="103d" id="103d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In his testimony, Kushner claimed that at the Mayflower, he could not recall the name of the Russian ambassador. If he didn’t know it before, he certainly committed it to memory that night. He would meet in person with Kislyak at least three more times, and take God knows how many of the multi-chinned ambassador’s phone calls. Kushner did so as covertly as he knew how. At a Trump Tower meeting in early December 2016, for example, Kislyak was secreted into the building to scheme with Kushner and Michael Flynn, the disgraced general who was the incoming national security adviser.</p><p name="11a8" id="11a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If Kislyak was not Kushner’s FSB handler, he was certainly doing a convincing job of pretending otherwise.</p><p name="6b2b" id="6b2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It was not just Kushner, however. Kislyak would also take several eyebrow-raising meetings with Jeff Sessions (at the RNC in July 2016, and at the senator’s Capitol Hill offices on 8 September 2016); with J.D. Gordon and Carter Page (at the RNC); and, of course, with President Trump in the Oval Office on 9 May 2017 — the day after the president fired James Comey.</p></div></div></section><section name="52fb" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="17f4" id="17f4" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading"><span class="graf-dropCap">T</span>he third Russian agent is perhaps the most obscure, but also arguably the most critical of the troika: Alexandr Torshin. Nominally a politician and board member of Russia’s Central Bank, he is, like Trump, an alleged money launderer for the Russian mafiya — in Torshin’s case, for the Tambovskaya Bratva. There is a mob-related warrant for his arrest in Spain.</p><p name="d6a0" id="d6a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Torshin is a longstanding member of the National Rifle Association.

Among the attendees at that event: Trump and his namesake son; Rand Paul, <a href="https://medium.com/@gregolear/red-paul-the-senator-from-kentucky-is-now-working-for-vladimir-putin-5ecad382f623" data-href="https://medium.com/@gregolear/red-paul-the-senator-from-kentucky-is-now-working-for-vladimir-putin-5ecad382f623" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">who has long ties to Russia</a>, and was alleged by John McCain of working for Putin; Jeff Sessions; Trey Gowdy; and “Sheriff” David Clarke.</p><p name="2ea4" id="2ea4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maria Butina was Torshin’s usual companion at NRA events. The indicted Russian spy named Torshin as her Russian handler. If true, this means that Torshin directed her to seduce the various Republican operatives and politicians she bedded, including her “boyfriend” Paul Erickson. Through Erickson, Torshin and Butina succeeded to infiltrate Trump’s inner circle, as Torshin met with Donald Trump, Jr. at an NRA event in May 2016. The topic of that discussion is not known. But, as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-obtains-alexander-torshin-wiretaps-from-spanish-police-2018-5" data-href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-obtains-alexander-torshin-wiretaps-from-spanish-police-2018-5" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sonam Sheth writes</a> in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Business Insider</em>:</p><blockquote name="7461" id="7461" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">When [Spanish prosecutor Jose] Grinda was asked whether he was concerned about Torshin’s interactions with Trump Jr. and other American political figures, Grinda replied, “Mr. Trump’s son should be concerned.”</blockquote><p name="f26f" id="f26f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing">More details about Torshin will emerge as the Butina case plays out.
