data-reactid="227"></div><div class="content paywall drop-cap" data-reactid="228"><p data-reactid="229">For the first time in <strong>Donald Trump&#x2019;s</strong> presidency, the West Wing soap opera appears to be in hiatus, with many of its starring characters (<strong>Gary Cohn, Hope Hicks</strong>) either permanently offstage or with much reduced roles (<strong>John Kelly, Jared Kushner</strong>). Currently, there&#x2019;s one star&#x2014;a situation Trump is obviously enjoying&#x2014;and his new freedom is used to focus ever more closely on his perceived enemies and obsessions. Amazon, whose owner, <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/jeff-bezos#intcid=dt-hot-link">Jeff Bezos</a>,</strong> also owns <em>The Washington Post,</em> is currently the main target. Trump has <a href="http://deadline.com/2018/03/trump-tweets-amazon-washington-post-jeff-bezos-1202356418/">ripped into Amazon</a> in recent days, claiming in a series of tweets that Jeff Bezos&#x2019;s tech giant benefits from billions in subsidies from the U.S. Post office while skirting sales taxes. &#x201C;Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state &amp; local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!&#x201D; Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/979326715272065024?lang=en">tweeted</a>. On Monday, he <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/980800783313702918">wrote</a>: &#x201C;Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country . . . not a level playing field!&#x201D; The tweets caused Amazon&#x2019;s stock to plunge 5 percent on Monday.</p><!-- react-empty: 230 --><!-- react-empty: 231 --><!-- react-empty: 232 --><p data-reactid="233">Now, according to four sources close to the White House, Trump is discussing ways to escalate his Twitter attacks on Amazon to further damage the company. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s off the hook on this. It&#x2019;s war,&#x201D; one source told me. &#x201C;He gets obsessed with something, and now he&#x2019;s obsessed with Bezos,&#x201D; said another source. &#x201C;Trump is like, how can I fuck with him?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="234">According to sources, Trump wants the Post Office to increase Amazon&#x2019;s shipping costs. When Trump previously discussed the idea inside the White Hose, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/gary-cohn#intcid=dt-hot-link">Gary Cohn</a> had explained that Amazon is a benefit to the Postal Service, which has seen mail volume plummet in the age of e-mail. &#x201C;Trump doesn&#x2019;t have Gary Cohn breathing down his neck saying you can&#x2019;t do the Post Office shit,&#x201D; a Republican close to the White House said. &#x201C;He really wants the Post Office deal renegotiated. He thinks Amazon&#x2019;s getting a huge fucking deal on shipping.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="235">Advisers are also encouraging Trump to cancel Amazon&#x2019;s pending multi-billion contract with the Pentagon to provide cloud computing services, sources say. Another line of attack would be to encourage attorneys general in red states to open investigations into Amazon&#x2019;s business practices. Sources say Trump is open to the ideas. (The White House did not respond to a request for comment.)</p><p data-reactid="236">Even Trump&#x2019;s allies acknowledge that much of what&#x2019;s fueling Trump&#x2019;s rage toward Amazon is that Amazon C.E.O. Jeff Bezos owns <em>The Washington Post,</em> sources said. &#x201C;Trump doesn&#x2019;t like <em>The New York Times,</em> but he reveres it because it&#x2019;s his hometown paper. <em>The Washington Post,</em> he has zero respect for,&#x201D; the Republican close to the White House said. While the <em>Post</em> says that Bezos has no involvement in newsroom decisions, Trump has told advisers he believes Bezos uses the paper as a political weapon. One former White House official said Trump looks at the <em>Post</em> the same way he looks at the <em>National Enquirer.</em> &#x201C;When Bezos says he has no involvement, Trump doesn&#x2019;t believe him. His experience is with the <strong>David Peckers</strong> of the world. Whether it&#x2019;s right or wrong, he knows it can be done.&#x201D;</p><div class="mvt-variant" style="min-width:1px;min-height:1px;" data-cn-variation="_8550255229" data-cn-test="_8546053398"

Trump has <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2018/03/trump-tweets-amazon-washington-post-jeff-bezos-1202356418/\">ripped into Amazon</a> in recent days, claiming in a series of tweets that Jeff Bezos&#x2019;s tech giant benefits from billions in subsidies from the U.S. Post office while skirting sales taxes. &#x201C;Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state &amp; local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!&#x201D; Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/979326715272065024?lang=en\">tweeted</a>.

THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed.

So let’s just zero in on the money.\n<p>“I’m <em>really</em> rich,” Trump declared while announcing his candidacy in June 2015. To prove it, he released a “Summary of Net Worth” balance sheet, indicating a net worth of $8,737,540,000. A month later he upwardly revised that figure to “in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.” (The caps are his.)</p>\n<p>Since then, a cottage industry of spreadsheet-diving journalists has worked itself into a lather trying to peg his real net worth. But without tax returns to go on, it’s really anybody’s guess. Despite the all-caps figures Trump has dispensed, most estimates from the established financial-media outlets have been lower, FAR LOWER. <em>Forbes</em> put his net worth at $4.5 billion. <em>Fortune</em> postulated $3.7 billion, and later upped it to $3.9 billion. Bloomberg guessed it was “closer to $2.9 billion.”</p>\n<p>In response to these wanton guesstimates, Trump instinctually fired back at the guesstimators. “<em>Forbes</em> is a bankrupt magazine, doesn’t know what they’re talking about.” “<em>Fortune</em> has no idea what my assets are” and “has totally lost its way.” But the real sulfuric acid was reserved for the lowballers over at Bloomberg. As usual, Trump made it personal, even suggesting his “friend,” the former New York City mayor, might be jealous. “Maybe Michael told them to do it,” Trump speculated in the <em>Daily Mail,</em> “because he always wanted to do what I’m doing.” Perhaps wisely, <em>The New Yorker</em>&#8212;even with its legendary phalanx of persnickety fact-checkers&#8212;wouldn’t venture any closer than “just a back-of-the-envelope calculation” of $2.56 billion, “which shouldn’t be taken too seriously.”</p>\n<p>In November, Trump was elected president of the United States in a shocking turn of events.

It’s a question that persists into the third year of Trump’s tenure in the White House, and investigations of the matter have yielded surprising insight into the commander in chief’s styling habits.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/us/politics/trump-tan.html\">The New York Times</a></em> pursued the idea as a matter of Trump’s health, though a senior administration official only offered that Trump’s notable tan&#8212;in February, no less&#8212;is the result of “good genes.” Further investigation revealed that neither tanning beds nor spray-tan booths exist within the White House or Air Force One, at least according to senior officials. Former aide <strong>Omarosa Manigault Newman</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/death-spiral-why-omarosa-totally-triggered-trump\">wrote in a tell-all book</a> that Trump travels with a tanning bed, while lighter-hued circles around the president’s eyes have fueled speculation that he utilizes goggles to protect himself from ultraviolet rays.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, neither bronzer nor tanning cream has been observed among Trump’s bathroom grooming products, at least when the president has offered a tour of the facilities to supporters. Trump, who suffers from rosacea, is reported to apply his own translucent makeup powder before television appearances, and has even adjusted the lighting at White House events to avoid appearing too orange on-screen. When possible, he prefers the natural light of the White House Rose Garden.</p>\n<p>Trump’s orange hue has also proven a frequent source of media ridicule, even as <em>Saturday Night Live</em> star <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> has suggested makeup artists deliberately avoid exaggerating the shade&#8212;at <strong>Lorne Michaels’s</strong> behest&#8212;so as “not to over-orange anything out of malice.” Baldwin has otherwise described Trump’s look as somewhere between “Mark Rothko orange” and a “slightly paler Orange Crush.”</p>\n<p>The president is famously self-sufficient when it comes to appearance, even detailing the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/photos/2015/09/an-illustrated-history-of-donald-trumps-hair\">elaborate process</a> behind his signature swooping blond hair. And while an unnamed former campaign hand admitted Trump’s orange glow is “a captivating story,” they insisted Trump’s grooming habits are his own secret to keep.</p>","rubric":"45

on Friday, and has agreed to back pay some 800,000 federal workers the salaries they missed during the previous 35-day shutdown. But when it comes to the federal contractors who also went unpaid during that period&#8212;up to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/13/18223471/back-pay-federal-contractors-shutdown\">580,000 people</a>, according to one estimate&#8212;it gets trickier. “I’ve been told the president won’t sign” anything that guarantees them back pay, Senator <strong>Roy Blunt</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-blocking-contractor-back-pay-gov-t-funding-deal-lawmaker-n971226\">told reporters</a> on Wednesday. “I guess federal contractors are different in his view than federal employees.”</p>\n<p>On the 2016 campaign trail, it was a well-known (but ultimately overlooked) fact that Trump <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-business-plan-left-a-trail-of-unpaid-bills-1465504454\">routinely refused to pay contractors</a> during his career as a businessman. But the idea of paying these contractors reportedly had bipartisan support, until <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> shot it down. A legislative source <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/429827-push-to-include-contractor-back-pay-in-funding-deal-hits-gop-roadblock\">told</a> the Hill that the administrative cost alone to pay back the contractors would be as high as the back pay itself, and that previous shutdown negotiations did not include this provision. “That was not initially part of our deal,” Senator <strong>Richard Shelby</strong> explained. “I personally would rather keep it narrow in scope.”</p>\n<p>Other Republicans, such as <strong>John Cornyn,</strong> seemed to take joy in turning contractor pain to political gain. “<strong>[Nancy] Pelosi</strong> and <strong>[Chuck] Schumer</strong> should have thought about this and other collateral damage when they initially refused to negotiate on border security, something they are apparently now willing to do,” he told NBC News. “Thousands of federal contractors have not been reimbursed from the 35-day shutdown,” Schumer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1095770911196831744\">said</a> in response to these reports. “This issue is hanging in the balance. . . .

let go of his longtime rivalry with <em>S.N.L.,</em> squeezing in a ding at the “Democrat spin machine” here, a defense of <strong>Kanye West</strong> there, but largely ignoring its jabs. That appeared to change Sunday morning, as Trump resumed his full-throated attacks after a particularly scathing series of sketches. “Nothing funny about tired <em>Saturday Night Live</em> on Fake News NBC!” he tweeted.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097116612279316480</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The president presumably caught wind of Saturday’s cold open, which featured <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> reprising his long-standing impression to mock the president’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-national-emergency-declaration-wall\">declaration</a> of a national emergency on Friday. Trump and his ilk have famously bristled at the impression, and didn’t take kindly to <em>Saturday Night Live</em> recounting&#8212;arguably without parody&#8212;the controversial press conference.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block video row\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8vQlhWBvAwY\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"> </iframe></div></div><p>“Wall works, wall makes safe. You don’t have to be smart to understand that&#8212;in fact, it’s even easier to understand if you’re not that smart,” he said, increasingly stunting his grammar. “You can all see why I gotta fake this national emergency, right? I have to because I want to. It’s really simple. We have a problem. Drugs are coming into this country through no wall.”</p>\n<p>The impression also took aim at Trump’s own sing-song recital of the challenges his declaration will face in court.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ll immediately be sued, and the ruling will not go in my favor and then\nend up in the Supreme Court, and then I’ll call my buddy Kavanaugh\nand I’ll say, ‘It’s time to repay the Donny,’ and he’ll say, ‘New phone, who dis?’\nAnd by then the Mueller report will be released, crumbling my house of cards,\nand I can just plead insanity and do a few months in the puzzle factory and my\npersonal hell of playing president will finally be over.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the real Trump threatening “retribution” for NBC’s “Republican hit jobs,” the president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097117499336855553\">reiterated his talking point</a> that “THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!” Trump had kept largely silent on the topic of <em>S.N.L.</em> in recent months, only piping up when supporter Kanye West controversially <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/kanye-west-trump-rant-video-saturday-night-live-snl-chris-rock-instagram\">donned a “Make America Great Again” hat</a> in a September outro:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1046443996074127361\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1046443996074127361\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1046443996074127361</a></p></blockquote></div><p>He also raged against the network in December, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1074302851906707457\">tweeting</a>, “A REAL scandal is the one sided coverage, hour by hour, of networks like NBC &amp; Democrat spin machines like <em>Saturday Night Live.</em> It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials.

His Instagram bio says his job is “EVP of Development &amp; Acquisitions The @Trump Organization,” which sounds as real as anything in a high-flying world of shell companies and bad reality TV. The answer, it would appear, is that when you’re the president’s grown son, you have a lot of jobs. You <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtmPqx1AxLP/?utm_source=ig_embed\">flop around on rocks</a> to make the case for your own virility.

Get you a large adult son who can do both, as they say.</p>\n<p>Trump Jr. attended Malaysian designer <strong>Zang Toi’s</strong> show at Spring Studios on Wednesday. His look for the night was salt-and-pepper beard. Against all known <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/science-explains-why-a-beard-makes-you-look-hotter_n_6618142\">beard science, which states men look better with beards</a>, his look is more of a bot that is getting better and better at this smiling thing every day. His family <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2018/11/26/lead-pamela-brown-dnt-trump-ignoring-everything-jake-tapper.cnn\">has not put much faith in science</a>, anyway.</p>\n<p>Junior’s ex-stepmother, <strong>Marla Maples,</strong> was there, too, sitting a cool three seats away from him&#8212;close enough to look like they’re a part of one big party, and far enough away that she could convincingly avoid eye contact. (In past years, <a href=\"https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/presidents-former-wife-a-regular-zang-toi-10987395/\">Toi has invited</a> Junior’s mom and the president’s first ex-wife, <strong>Ivana Trump.</strong>) Between the biggest Trump boy and Maples was Fox News’ <em>America’s Newsroom</em> host <strong>Bill Hemmer</strong> and Fox News personality-turned-Don Jr’s girlfriend <strong>Kimberly Guilfoyle.</strong></p>\n<p>There at the fashion show, Junior told the press that he’s dating a cool girl. She fishes and shoots guns, he said, but also wears makeup and the fashions. “[Guilfoyle has] even been out with me down to Texas with some of my buddies there. They all go, ‘Hey, it’s a guy camp. Are you sure she’s going to be O.K.?’ I’m like, ‘Don’t worry, boys. I’m making you sign a waiver. She’s going to destroy all of you,’” he <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/02/13/donald-trump-jr-and-kimberly-guilfoyle-to-keep-it-low-key-for-valentines-day/\">told</a> the <em>New York Post.</em></p>\n<p>Toi’s finale look was an American flag skirt that could very well come to a <strong>Joy Villa</strong> near you next fall. (Wow, can’t believe this guy is co-signing a person dragging the American flag on the floor like that. What a shame&#8212;it’s like he doesn’t even respect America anymore, etc.) The designer made a special stop at the end of the runway to kiss Guilfoyle and shake Don’s hand. Who knows what he’s thinking as he smiles down at the designer. My best guess? “She’s going to destroy all of you,” over and over again, forever.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The dirty truth about <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/the-dirty-secret-of-el-chapo-downfall?inline\">El Chapo’s downfall</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; That time <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/brian-rea-modern-love-death-wins-a-goldfish?inline\">death took a break</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The 25 <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/25-best-movie-scenes?inline\">most influential movie scenes</a> of the past 25 years</p>\n<p>&#8212; Acupuncture and hypno-birthing?

Since then, he has been extremely busy, having reportedly been involved in high-level meetings that preceded the agency’s decision <em>not</em> to set drinking water limits for chemicals known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which “have been linked with kidney and testicular cancer, as well as other ailments.” (In a statement, <strong>David Ross</strong>, EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Water, told the Hive: “Despite what is being reported, EPA has not finalized or publicly issued its PFAS management plan, and any information that speculates what is included in the plan is premature. The agency is committed to following the Safe Drinking Water Act process for evaluating new drinking water standards, which is just one of the many components of the draft plan that is currently undergoing interagency review.”) According to Politico, Dunlap has been able to avoid a Senate confirmation hearing in which his prior work experience might come up because Trump has not officially nominated anyone to run to office. (Dunlap’s <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/research/david-dunlap\">official bio</a> on the E.P.A. Web site declines to mention any of his employers during his “more than 30 years” working for “private industry, trade associations and as an environmental consultant.”) Currently, Koch subsidiary Georgia-Pacific, a paper and pulp conglomerate, is facing at least one class-action suit related to chemicals now under Dunlap’s purview.</p>\n<p>Koch’s various environmental crimes against humanity are laid out in several high-profile lawsuits over the past 20 years. According to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111005022145/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-02/koch-brothers-flout-law-getting-richer-with-secret-iran-sales.html\">Bloomberg</a>, “Koch Industries was assessed more than $400 million in fines, penalties, and judgments” between 1999 and 2003, such as for dumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of aviation fuel into a Minnesota wetland. “You want an independent, hardheaded scientific review of these issues; you don’t want somebody who is already taking the industry party line,” <strong>Erik Olson,</strong> who heads up the Natural Resources Defense Council’s public health work, told Politico. “There’s a legitimate threat there and, from my perspective, the conflicts of interest that [Dunlap] has having worked as a regulatory compliance director at Georgia-Pacific raises questions about whether he can make those objective decisions or should be recused.”</p>\n<p>Dunlap, of course, is unlikely to be replaced by someone without a host of conflicts of interest given that the guy currently running the E.P.A., <strong>Andrew Wheeler,</strong> is a walking, talking conflict of interest, having <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/07/06/626525274/get-to-know-andrew-wheeler-ex-coal-lobbyist-with-inside-track-to-lead-epa\">served as a coal-lobbyist</a> prior to taking over the top job from departed Grift King <strong>Scott Pruitt.</strong> It is, in other words, par for the course.

The president showed up about 40 minutes late to his planned speech Friday morning in the Rose Garden and immediately began rambling about trade negotiations with China. He proceeded to go on a long tangent about trade, Brexit, Syria, and his plans for a second summit with North Korea’s <strong>Kim Jong Un,</strong> all without the use of a teleprompter. Eventually he got to the point. “I’m going to be signing a national emergency,” Trump said. According to White House officials, the declaration will allow Trump to redirect $3.6 billion from the military, $2.5 billion from counter-narcotics programs, and $600 million from the Treasury to build a border wall that Congress refused to fund.</p>\n<p>Trump appeared resigned to being sued for what both Democrats and Republicans have denounced as an unconstitutional power grab. “We will have a national emergency, and we will then be <em>sued,</em>” he explained, breaking into a strange sing-song voice. “And they will sue us in the Ninth <em>Circuit,</em> even though it <em>shouldn’t</em> be there, and we will possibly get a bad <em>ruling,</em> and then we’ll get another bad <em>ruling,</em> and then we’ll end up in the Supreme <em>Court,</em> and hopefully we’ll get a fair <em>shake,</em> and we’ll win in the Supreme <em>Court</em> just like the <em>ban.</em>”</p>\n<p>The government lawyers who will inevitably have to argue that case were surely appalled by what came next. “We have so much money. But on the wall, they skimped,” he said, complaining that Congress had not given him the $5.7 billion in funding he wanted. “I didn’t need to do this,” he added, potentially undermining any legal justification for an emergency declaration. “But I’d rather do it much faster.”</p>\n<p>It is hard to capture in text the utter strangeness of the entire incoherent, self-defeating monologue. As always with Trump, the <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?457952-1/president-trump-sign-national-emergency-build-border-wall&amp;vod&amp;start=34\">full video</a> needs to be seen to be believed. But for those who can’t bring themselves to watch 50 minutes of the president praising himself and berating reporters, here are the most absurd highlights:</p>\n<p><strong>On other emergency declarations:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s been signed many times before. It’s been signed by other presidents. From 1977 or so, it gave the presidents the power. There’s rarely been a problem. They sign it; nobody cares. I guess they weren’t very exciting. But nobody cares. They sign it for far less important things in some cases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On executing drug dealers:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[In China] a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty. Our . . . drug dealer gets a thing called, “How about a fine?” . . .  So if we want to get smart, we can get smart. You can end the drug problem&#8212;can end it a lot faster than you think.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On Paul Ryan, who advised him against focusing on the wall:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will tell you, I’m very disappointed at certain people&#8212;particularly one&#8212;for not having pushed this faster.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On his biggest conservative fans:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Look, <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do. Not of me. If I change my views, he wouldn&#39;t be with me. <strong>Rush Limbaugh:</strong> I think he’s a great guy. Here’s a guy who could speak for three hours without a phone call. Try doing that sometime. For three hours, he speaks. He’s got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world. I mean, this guy is unbelievable. Try speaking for three hours without taking calls. Taking calls is easy. “O.K., I&#39;ll answer this one, that one.” He goes for three hours and he’s got an audience that’s fantastic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On his friendship with dictator Kim Jong Un:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was a very tough dialogue at the beginning. Fire and fury. Total annihilation. “My button is bigger than yours” and “my button works.” . . . [But] I like him a lot and he likes me a lot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On Ann Coulter, who has called his emergency declaration a scam:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ann Coulter,</strong> I don’t know her. I hardly know her. I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year. but the press loves saying “Ann Coulter.” Probably if I did speak to her, she’d be very nice. I just don’t have the time . . . I would speak to her, I have nothing against her. . . . But she&#39;s off the reservation. But anybody that knows her understands that. But I haven’t spoken to her. I don’t follow her. I don’t talk to her. But the press loves to bring up the name “Ann Coulter.” And you know what, I think she’s fine. . . . I just don’t speak to her.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On where he gets his (debunked) statistics on immigration:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I get my numbers from a lot of sources, like Homeland Security, primarily. And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster. And you know what else is a disaster? The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, <strong>Kirstjen [Nielsen],</strong> for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration. Billions and billions of dollars a month. Billions and billions of dollars and it’s unnecessary. . . . I use many stats . . . you have stats far worse than the ones I use, but I use many stats. But I also use Homeland Security.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On why he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, Part I:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think the people understand what we do. . . . Prime Minister <strong>[Shinzō] Abe</strong> [gave me]&#8212;it’s the most beautiful five-page letter. Nobel Prize. He sent it to them. You know why? Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan. And they had alarms going off&#8212;you know that. Now, all of a sudden, they feel good. They feel safe. I did that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On why he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, Part II:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you look at Idlib Province in Syria, I stopped the slaughter of perhaps three million people, nobody talk about that. . . . Russia and Iran and Syria were going to go in and perhaps destroy three million people in order to get 45,000 terrorists. And I heard about it from a woman who had her parents and her brother living there. And she said, “Please, please.” And I thought&#8212;I said, “No. It can’t happen. What are you talking about it?” “No, they’re going to. ” And I come home and I read a certain paper where the story was there, that they were actually forming to go into&#8212;to, really, to really do big destruction. And I put out a statement that, “You’d better not do it.” And in all fairness to Russia and Iran and Syria, they didn’t attack. Or they’re doing it surgically, at least. Saved a lot of people.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

troops depart.","promoDek":"America’s allies “unanimously” declined the Trump administration’s request to pick up the slack in Syria when U.S. troops depart.","body":"<p>Yet again, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has jumped the gun. Last week, the Trump administration revealed plans to remove all American troops from Syria by the end of April&#8212;a position long championed by the president. The move rankled even some congressional allies like Senator <strong>Lindsey Graham,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">apparently</a> made his displeasure known to Acting Defense Secretary <strong>Patrick Shanahan</strong> over the weekend. Now, it’s clear lawmakers weren’t the only ones blindsided by the planned withdrawal&#8212;key United States allies appear to have been left out of the loop as well.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/allies-say-they-wont-remain-in-syria-after-us-troops-withdraw/2019/02/20/62e503b2-3532-11e9-a400-e481bf264fdc_story.html?utm_term=.9c6870c65501\">reported</a> that U.S. allies “unanimously” declined the Trump administration’s request to pick up the slack fighting ISIS in Syria if the U.S. removes its troops in the spring, as Trump has apparently directed Shanahan to do. A senior administration official told the <em>Post</em> that allies have made it clear they “won’t stay if you pull out.” Trump’s hasty move, then, could leave behind a powder keg. “It’s not safe to leave these enemies there, without any referee or mediating force,” said a U.S. official.</p>\n<p>His approach to Syria is the latest example of Trump’s seeming tendency to push policy without working out the details, which has frustrated even some of his closest allies. “That’s the dumbest fucking idea I’ve ever heard,” Graham evidently <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">told</a> Shanahan of Trump’s withdrawal plan in a meeting in Munich last Saturday. The South Carolina Republican, normally a staunch defender of the president, has been venting about the administration’s Syria policy since December, when Trump suddenly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/donald-trump-syria-troops\">announced</a> it would be up to other nations to fight ISIS there&#8212;despite also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1075397797929775105\">claiming</a> that the terrorist organization had been “defeated.” Graham torched the policy, saying at the time that he would “hold the administration accountable for this decision,” and threatened hearings over the planned move.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to imagine that any president would wake up and make this kind of decision with this little communication,” Republican Senator <strong>Bob Corker</strong> said at the time.</p>\n<p>But it appears that’s precisely how Trump has approached one of the most complicated foreign-policy conundrums of his presidency. While the commander-in-chief seemingly continues to talk out of his ass&#8212;on Friday, he said he would announce the “eradication of the caliphate . . . over the next 24 hours,” but no such announcement has come&#8212;U.S. allies appear to be losing patience. Last week, French Foreign Minister <strong>Jean-Yves Le Drian</strong> <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/u-s-pullout-from-syria-benefits-iran-says-french-fm-1.6938647\">called</a> Trump’s call for withdrawal a “mystery,” and British Foreign Secretary <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> has said that “there is no prospect of British forces replacing the Americans” in Syria. Their pushback has left Trump hanging. Whether it will be enough to force him to reconsider remains to be seen.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a

controversy.","promoDek":"The president’s daughter downplayed the project&#8212;and distanced herself from the controversy.","body":"<p>In the wake of recent reporting detailing <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> efforts to build a Trump Tower in Russia during the presidential campaign, <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> appeared Friday on ABC to downplay the controversial real-estate project&#8212;and put some distance between herself and the president. Asked by <strong>Abby Huntsman</strong> whether she had any concerns about the project, the senior White House adviser <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/08/politics/ivanka-trump-russia-investigation/index.html\">responded</a> that she knew “literally almost nothing” about a Trump Organization proposal to build a skyscraper in downtown Moscow, and said she had “zero concern” that anyone in her family could be implicated in <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> investigation into Russian efforts to fix the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Of course, Ivanka’s account differs somewhat from various reports suggesting she knew a great deal about the project. According to <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/mueller-eyes-ivanka-don-jr-s-work-trump-tower-moscow-003012099.html\">Yahoo News</a>, both she and <strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong> were involved in the project as far back as 2013, and were aware that former Trump lawyer <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> had been working to revive the deal. In October 2015, Trump Sr. signed a letter of intent to move forward with negotiations, but has continued to be evasive about the extent of his ambitions. In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress about the scope of the Trump Tower project, and BuzzFeed News recently reported that the president directed Cohen to say that those negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did, though the special counsel’s office issued an unusual statement disputing the BuzzFeed story as “not accurate.”</p>\n<p>According to the contested BuzzFeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation\">report</a>, both Ivanka and Trump Jr. received “regular, detailed updates” about the project from Cohen. Ivanka would reportedly have managed a spa at the tower, and per BuzzFeed, instructed Cohen to speak with a Russian athlete who had “synergy on a government level” to move the project along. A spokesperson for the First Daughter’s attorney told BuzzFeed that she was only “minimally involved” in proceedings, and “did not know about this proposal until after a non-binding letter of intent had been signed.” Her older brother, meanwhile, has testified under oath that he was only “peripherally aware” of the plans.</p>\n<p>She contested the Yahoo report too, insisting that her involvement in the project was limited to recommending an architect. But in her interview with Huntsman, she offered additional explanations: the Moscow deal was one of many she was juggling, she was too busy to have paid much attention, and it never moved beyond a theoretical stage. “There was never a binding contract,” she told Huntsman during the <em>Good Morning America</em> interview, part of which aired Friday. “I never talked to the&#8212;with a third party outside of the organization about it. It was one of&#8212;I mean, we could have had 40 or 50 deals like that, that were floating around, that somebody was looking at. Nobody visited it to see if it was worth our time. So this was not exactly like an advanced project.”</p>\n<p>“There’s nothing there, yet it’s created weeks and weeks and months of headlines,” she added. “So no, I have zero concern.”</p>\n<h3>More

Chief among them, of course, have been Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-attacks-obstruction-investigation.html\">1,200 or so</a> public attacks on individuals and groups connected to inquiries into potential collusion between his campaign and Russia. (Trump has called <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> investigation a “witch hunt” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=witch%20hunt%20from%3Arealdonaldtrump&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en\">dozens of times on Twitter</a>; other times he just blurts “witch hunt!” without any context whatsoever.) There’s also the time he <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/donald-trump-fires-fbi-director-james-comey\">fired</a> the director of the F.B.I.; the private campaign to remove <strong>Jeff Sessions</strong> for failing to “protect him”; and the hiring of <strong>Rudy Giuliani,</strong> whose job has been to wage a public-relations war to “undermine the credibility of both Mr. Mueller and the Justice Department,” which has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/rudy-giuliani-robert-mueller-collusion-russia\">not worked out so well</a>. More recently, the president apparently used some precious hours of “Executive Time” to try to install a friendly face atop the investigation into his hush-money payments during the election.</p>\n<p>Last year, according to the <em>Times,</em> Trump summoned his newly installed acting attorney general, <strong>Matthew Whitaker</strong>&#8212;the one he claimed to not know despite <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/trump-denies-knowing-whitaker-who-he-met-a-dozen-times.html\">meeting with him on at least 12 separate occasions</a>&#8212;to ask him a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1068442531887632384\">very legal and very cool</a> question. Could <strong>Geoffrey Berman,</strong> the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, take over the investigation into <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-played-central-role-in-hush-payoffs-to-stormy-daniels-and-karen-mcdougal-1541786601\">Trump’s role</a> in paying porn star <strong>Stormy Daniels</strong> and former <em>Playboy</em> model <strong>Karen McDougal</strong> to keep quiet about their alleged affairs? In Berman, Trump obviously saw the perfect guy for the job, given his background as the son of a real-estate developer; his time <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/10/top-ny-prosecutor-geoffrey-berman-trump-appointee-recused-michael-cohen-inquiry/502367002/\">as a principal at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/rudy-giuliani-greenberg-traurig-resignation\">which previously employed Giuliani until the association likely became too mortifying to bear</a>; and his <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-thought-hed-picked-his-perfect-us-attorney-in-geoffrey-berman-he-was-very-wrong\">hefty donation to the Trump campaign in 2016</a>. In Whitaker, too, Trump presumably saw a guy with a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/matthew-whitaker-world-patent-marketing-scam\">somewhat elastic view of right and wrong</a>, who would be eager to do his bidding. But alas! It was not to be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Whitaker, who had privately told associates that part of his role at the Justice Department was to “jump on a grenade” for the president, knew he could not put Mr. Berman in charge because Mr. Berman had already recused himself from the investigation. The president soon soured on Mr. Whitaker, as he often does with his aides, and complained about his inability to pull levers at the Justice Department that could make the president’s many legal problems go away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The revelation not only highlights Trump’s continued reliance on <em>Sopranos</em>-esque tactics while working in the White House, but also puts Whitaker in an awkward situation vis-à-vis potentially lying to Congress:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Whitaker, who this month told a congressional committee that Mr. Trump had never pressured him over the various investigations, is now under scrutiny by House Democrats for possible perjury.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A spokeswoman for the Justice Department told the <em>Times</em> that the White House never asked Whitaker to interfere in the hush-money investigation. “Under oath to the House Judiciary Committee, then-Acting Attorney General Whitaker stated that ‘at no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel’s investigation or any other investigation,’” said <strong>Kerri Kupec.</strong> “Mr. Whitaker stands by his testimony.” Meanwhile, it will undoubtedly shock you to hear that Trump has dubbed the whole thing “fake news”:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962\">https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962</a></p></blockquote></div><h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Storms’-a-brewin","socialTitle":"Report: Trump Tried to Muzzle Investigation into His Porno Payoffs","socialDescription":"The president thought he could install a friendly face atop the probe.

The president has made clear he’s no fan of the agreement, but with no Republican appetite for a second shutdown or unilateral action by the White House, and a Friday deadline looming, he may not have much of a choice&#8212;even as he leaves open the possibility of finding “other sources” to get the sum he’s spent months demanding. “I’m not happy about it,” Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/12/trump-meeting-cant-say-happy-border-deal-remarks-ip-vpx.cnn\">told reporters</a> of the deal on Tuesday. “It’s not doing the trick. But I’m adding things to it, and when you add whatever I have to add&#8212;it’s all gonna happen where we’re gonna build a beautiful, big, strong wall.”</p>\n<p>“It’s very simple,” he said.</p>\n<p>It makes sense that Trump isn’t thrilled about the deal. It includes just $1.375 billion for border fencing&#8212;far less than the nearly $6 billion he’d been seeking to build a concrete wall, and less even than the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/418507-schumer-dems-oppose-spending-more-than-16b-on-border-security\">$1.6 billion</a> <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> had offered him before Trump shut down the government last year. For the guy who authored <em>Art of the Deal,</em> it’s unquestionably a defeat&#8212;a fact his base has already picked up on. Rep. <strong>Mark Meadows,</strong> one of Trump’s top Hill allies, said on Monday that the bill “does not represent a fraction of what the president has promised the American people” and suggested he shouldn’t sign it. <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> Trump’s Fox News id, called the funding measure a “garbage compromise” when details first emerged.</p>\n<p>But Hannity has since softened, saying he’s “not as concerned” about Trump signing what he’d previously described as an “insane” deal&#8212;as long as he also declares a national emergency to get the rest of the money for the wall. “The president would need to declare a national emergency,” Hannity <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2019/02/12/sean-hannity-says-declaring-national-emergency-border-necessity/222852\">said</a> Tuesday. “This is the time. That is a necessity.” Trump, too, has hinted that he could pull additional cash from “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1095469449052868610\">other sources</a>,” a possible reference to the nuclear option he’s been threatening for weeks. “Was just presented the concept and parameters of the Border Security Deal by hard working Senator <strong>Richard Shelby,</strong>” Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1095469447933059073\">tweeted</a> Tuesday evening. “Looking over all aspects knowing that this will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources. . . . Regardless of Wall money, it is being built as we speak!”</p>\n<p>There is more than one way for the White House to tap those “other sources,” although each comes with potential legal hurdles. As Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/11/mick-mulvaney-border-wall-funds-1163996\">reported</a> on Monday, the White House has already developed plans to redirect unspent federal dollars as part of an executive order that would bypass Congress without requiring an emergency declaration. “There are certain sums of money that are available to the president, to any president,” Chief of Staff <strong>Mick Mulvaney</strong> explained Sunday on <em>Meet the Press.</em> “So you comb through the law at the president&#39;s request . . . And there’s pots of money where presidents, all presidents, have access to without a national emergency.” Experts say the move would almost certainly provoke a challenge.</p>\n<p>For now, at least, Trump’s signature on the bipartisan border deal would avert another destructive shutdown. But it’s not a done deal just yet. While the funding measure was agreed to in principle, Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2019/02/13/is-the-border-wall-deal-in-danger-of-falling-apart-392261\">reported</a> Wednesday that lawmakers have discovered some unresolved areas of contention as they’ve worked to finalize it. That could be troublesome with a Friday deadline fast approaching&#8212;especially when the ultimate decision comes down to an unpredictable president whose whims can change with the wind.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

Republicans’ grip on the federal purse strings, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is set to bypass Congress and use the nuclear option to build his long-promised wall at the United States-Mexico border. It’s a move that will trigger a tough, protracted legal fight&#8212;and one that could even cause a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/trump-declares-national-emergency-border-wall-funding\">rift within the G.O.P.</a>, where leadership previously warned the president against an emergency declaration.</p>\n<p>Democrats, naturally, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/national-emergency-blocked-courts-temporarily-doj-warns-white/story?id=61086962\">labeled</a> the move “crazy,” “ridiculous,” and something “all of us will come to regret.” But Thursday also saw renewed cries of alarm from Republicans. Senator <strong>Susan Collins,</strong> who has criticized Trump in the past, released a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorCollins/status/1096175131733475330\">statement</a> calling the administration’s plan B a “mistake.” “Such a declaration would undermine the role of Congress and the appropriations process,” Collins said, warning of the precedent it could set. Kentucky Senator <strong>Rand Paul,</strong> a proponent of limited government, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096149684840738816\">told a reporter</a> he was “not in favor” of the plan, saying that “revenue raising and spending power was given to Congress” and suggesting that going around lawmakers would be an abuse of executive power. And Alaska Senator <strong>Lisa Murkowski,</strong> who’s stood up to the administration before, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096151375875133440\">said</a> she “[doesn’t] think this is a matter that should be declared a national emergency.”</p>\n<p>“I wish he wouldn’t have done it,” Senator <strong>Chuck Grassley</strong> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/14/gop-national-emergency-declaration-trump-1170697\">told</a> Politico. “I imagine we’ll find out whether he’s got the authority to do it by the courts.”</p>\n<p>“I never thought that was a good idea,” Republican Senator <strong>Pat Toomey</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1096153688681467905\">told a reporter</a>. “I still don’t.”</p>\n<p>Trump had long suggested he’d employ the nuclear option, having previously called the bipartisan talks that led to this week’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/congress-reaches-deal-to-fund-quarter-of-trump-border-wall\">border-security agreement</a> a “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/trump-great-negotiator-gives-up-on-negotiating-border-wall-national-emergency\">waste of time</a>.” He’d even <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/republicans-think-trump-nuclear-option-national-emergency-is-a-terrible-idea\">implied</a> that he would declare a national emergency during his State of the Union address earlier this month, but ultimately decided against it amid bipartisan backlash&#8212;including from Senate Majority Leader <strong>Mitch McConnell.</strong></p>\n<p>Now, though, Trump is planning to sign the bipartisan deal <em>and</em> employ the nuclear option. That will likely please his base, including <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> who signaled this week that the only way he’d give his blessing to the “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-prepares-to-sign-garbage-compromise-on-border-wall-funding\">garbage compromise</a>” would be if the president accompanied his signature with a national emergency. It’ll also please some of his Capitol Hill allies, including <strong>Lindsey Graham,</strong> who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GarrettHaake/status/1096144722215743489\">said</a> Thursday that “this is a political fight worth having.”</p>\n<p>It remains to be seen whether pushback from lawmakers can overcome the kudos from Trump’s base. That, after all, is one of the defining problems of Republican criticisms of Trump: that his detractors, time and again, have proven far more pliable than his allies. McConnell, who had previously opposed the nuclear option, announced his support on the Senate floor Thursday. And even those who expressed concern with the maneuver seemingly left themselves wiggle room. Take <strong>Marco Rubio:</strong> the Florida Republican indicated he believes Trump may be violating the Constitution if he bypasses Congress to build the wall&#8212;but only went so far as to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenRubioPress/status/1096172609392254978\">say</a> he is “skeptical it will be something [he] can support.” “I will wait to see what statutory or constitutional power the President relies on to justify such a declaration before making any definitive statement,” he said.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and

But in declaring a national emergency, the president risks a constitutional challenge&#8212;and causing lasting damage to the institution of Congress.","body":"<p>President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> will declare a national emergency to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, the White House confirmed Thursday afternoon, shortly after Senate Majority Leader <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> strode onto the Senate floor to announce that he would support the president’s power grab. “President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action&#8212;including a national emergency&#8212;to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis,” Press Secretary <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Trump had <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-wall-national-emergency-shutdown\">long threatened</a> to use his executive authority to build the wall if Democrats refused to give him the $5.7 billion he had demanded, despite the protestations of lawmakers in his own party. McConnell himself <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/mcconnell-privately-cautioned-trump-about-emergency-declaration-on-border-wall/2019/02/01/5ff1262c-2646-11e9-81fd-b7b05d5bed90_story.html\">previously warned</a> the president against declaring a national emergency, concerned it would split the Republican Party. In <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-01/trump-hints-he-ll-discuss-border-emergency-at-state-of-union\">recent days</a>, Trump reportedly convened his staff and advisers to begin drafting a national-emergency declaration for the wall, as it became clear that the omnibus budget would not include money for his signature campaign promise; the latest iteration allocated just $1.375 billion for 55 miles of barriers, fencing, and other security measures. Conservatives, including some of Trump’s top allies on Capitol Hill, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-prepares-to-sign-garbage-compromise-on-border-wall-funding\">panned the deal</a>. Fox News host <strong>Sean Hannity,</strong> perhaps the president’s most influential outside adviser, called it a “garbage compromise.”</p>\n<p>The president’s inability to build the wall, even when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, has been a continuing personal embarrassment. By declaring a national emergency, Trump can appease his base and save face&#8212;but he also risks a massive court battle. The move will likely trigger a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/01/trump-has-no-case-national-emergency/581356/\">constitutional challenge</a>, as it directly circumvents Congress’s power of the purse to address an emergency wholly manufactured by the president. Despite Trump’s insistence that there is a crisis at the border, illegal border crossings are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/11/us/politics/trump-border-crisis-reality.html\">down substantially</a> over the last two decades. While there is a very real <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-theres-a-crisis-at-the-border-heres-what-the-data-says\">asylum crisis</a> at the border, the vast majority of people seeking refuge in the United States, such as members of several recent “caravans,” typically present themselves at ports of entry in order to apply for protected status.</p>\n<p>Legal experts believe <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/trump-national-emergency.html?module=inline\">Trump could win</a> a court challenge over his authority to militarize border-wall construction, and the White House has been preparing for that eventuality. Asked Thursday if they are prepared to litigate a national-emergency declaration, Sanders said, “We’re very prepared, but there shouldn’t be [legal challenges]. The president’s doing his job. Congress should do theirs.”</p>\n<p>The larger problem identified by Republican critics is the precedent Trump would set by usurping Congress. After all, if Trump can decide that something qualifies as an emergency when he doesn’t get his way, what’s to stop a future Democratic president from deciding that something like climate change&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">an actual, global threat to humanity</a>&#8212;can be addressed by executive fiat? Trump himself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/535441553079431168\">tweeted</a> in 2014, “Repubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit &amp; because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, shortly after Sanders confirmed Trump’s intent to declare an emergency, House Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> issued a stark warning to Republicans. “Just think what a president with different values can present to the American people,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/politico/status/1096153922228703233\">she said</a> during a press conference Thursday. “You want to talk about a national emergency? Let’s talk about today, the one-year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America. That’s a national emergency. Why don’t you declare that an emergency, Mr. President? I wish you would, but a Democratic president can do that. A Democratic president can declare other emergencies as well.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Emergency Wall","socialTitle":"Trump Chooses the Nuclear Option to Build His Border Wall","socialDescription":"The president hopes to save face after a stinging legislative defeat.

Shaw in New York City. He was astounded to learn about the growth of the Internet&#8212;2,400 percent a year. Bezos decided he had to find a way to take advantage of the demand. He made a list of what he should sell online, eventually settling on books. Along with his wife, MacKenzie, Bezos drove across the country to Seattle, making revenue projections for his company the whole time. In 1994, he incorporated the company as Cadabra but switched to Amazon after a lawyer misheard the original name as “cadaver.” In 1995, Bezos sold the first book  on Amazon.com: Douglas Hofstadter&#39;s <em>Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought.</em> When Bezos took Amazon public, in 1997, it was an unusual public offering for a tech company at the time. Amazon went public before it ever turned a profit. Bezos didn’t expect Amazon to be profitable for several years.\n<p>Bezos popularized online shopping, and even when the dot-com bubble killed off many e-commerce companies, Amazon thrived. Amazon shares have only increased over time, and the company sells everything from clothes and music to cloud-computing services. Amazon has launched a smartphone and TV-streaming box. The company has revolutionized logistics, even reportedly leasing its own planes to move Amazon merchandise, so it’s no longer at the mercy of third-party shippers.</p>\n<p>But Amazon isn’t Bezos’s only endeavor. He bought <em>The Washington Post</em> for $250 million in 2013, and Bezos’s space-exploration company, Blue Origin, became one of the first commercial companies to launch a re-usable rocket, and he’ll likely keep churning out more creative endeavors with the passing of time. “What really matters is, companies that don’t continue to experiment, companies that don’t embrace failure, they eventually get in a desperate position where the only thing they can do is a Hail Mary bet at the very end of their corporate existence,” he told Business Insider’s Henry Blodget.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/57436e05614dc9a45cb0a85c_hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg","credit":"By David Ryder/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"57436e05c1f81aa45c8117ef","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","description":"Getty: 450831356","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/jeff-bezos","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/57436e05614dc9a45cb0a85c_hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-jeff-bezos.jpg","credit":"By David Ryder/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"57436e05c1f81aa45c8117ef","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 4:54 pm","description":"Getty: 450831356","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"57362902ff97be4071973df0","revision":8,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/jeff-bezos"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"What to Do If You’re Feeling Sympathy for Jeff Bezos, a Billionaire, After the Blog","promoHed":"What to Do If You’re Feeling Sympathy for Jeff Bezos, a Billionaire, After the Blog","dek":"Before you cancel yourself, let’s break down these strange emotions.","promoDek":"Before you cancel yourself, let’s break down these strange emotions.","body":"<p><strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> blogged a blog Thursday night. If you haven’t read it yet, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">go do so</a>. It’s no literary masterpiece&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/jeff-bezos-mackenzie-divorce-partners-in-ventures\">again</a>, Bezos’s soon-to-be ex-wife, <strong>MacKenzie,</strong> was the writer in the family&#8212;but it is a barn burner, and it works on several levels. It lays out how the <em>National Enquirer</em>’s parent company, American Media Inc., allegedly threatened to unleash intimate photos of the Amazon founder unless his private investigators stop prodding into the tabloid’s methods and, more crucially, he agrees to publicly state that the company was not “politically motivated” when it exposed his affair with TV host turned helicopter pilot <strong>Lauren Sanchez.</strong> It also invites surprising sympathy for Bezos, a very rich man whose path to wealth and ever-tightening grip on the future of American retail complexify those impulses&#8212;to borrow a term d’art.</p>\n<p>For starters, the public-figure sympathy economy is already in a recession. Expressing the feeling out loud, or in writing or even just thinking it is almost always a mistake, what with people getting <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/milkshake-duck\">milkshake-ducked</a> at an hourly rate. It always comes back to bite you. Person X probably wore blackface at a party in the 80s. He probably touched something he shouldn’t have. She probably has patronizing opinions on climate-change policy. Maybe she has bad tweets in the timeline. You thought you were showing your soft side, but it turned out to be your ass.</p>\n<p>And that’s before we get to Bezos and Amazon, neither of which is exactly unimpeachable. Sure, Bezos has proven to be a decent steward of <em>The Washington Post.</em> But Amazon has its hands in technologies like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/business/amazon-alexa-conversation-shared-echo.html\">Alexa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/amazon-facial-recognition-orlando-police-department\">police already use its facial recognition technology</a>. The innovations draw criticism for the ways they play fast and loose with private data. Plus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/30/accidents-at-amazon-workers-left-to-suffer-after-warehouse-injuries\">numerous</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/business/economy/amazon-workers-sears-bankruptcy-filing.html\">reports</a> have alleged poor working conditions in Amazon’s warehouses. (Per <em>The Guardian,</em> “Amazon meanwhile insists that ensuring the safety of its workers is a priority and that it was ‘proud’ of its record.”)</p>\n<p>Yet, in this particular fight between two powerful, usually unsympathetic entities, one emerges with some pathos, and it has everything to do with dick pics.</p>\n<p>Bezos’s two main foes are <strong>David Pecker,</strong> chairman of A.M.I., and <strong>Dylan Howard,</strong> the company’s chief content officer, who have something of a track record here. After “catch and kill” tactics&#8212;wherein a news outlet obtains exclusive rights to a story in order to <em>not</em> publish it&#8212;got <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/nyregion/trump-american-media-michael-cohen.html\">pulled into <strong>federal prosecutors’</strong> investigation</a>, A.M.I. signed a non-prosecution agreement that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/publisher-of-the-national-enquirer-admits-to-hush-money-payments-made-on-trumps-behalf/2018/12/12/ebf24b76-fe49-11e8-83c0-b06139e540e5_story.html?utm_term=.5039d826c06d\">includes</a> both Pecker and Howard.</p>\n<p>Per Bezos’s blog, A.M.I. allegedly threatened to release compromising photographs if Bezos didn’t meet its demands. In the e-mails, which Bezos says came from A.M.I., Bezos is asked to state that he has “no knowledge or basis for suggesting that A.M.I.’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.” Bezos believes that the request was motivated by political animus. (<em>The National Enquirer</em> and Trump are, or at least were, pals and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/is-national-enquirer-ami-ready-for-a-war-with-jeff-bezos\">Trump hates <em>The Washington Post</em></a>). Bezos claims to have refused, and tips his hand, alluding to an alleged dinner between an anonymous, Saudi-connected figure, Pecker, and Trump. (A.M.I. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/national-enquirer-publisher-believes-it-acted-lawfully-on-bezos-story-vows-to-investigate-matter.html\">said in a statement</a> that the company “believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos. Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him.”)</p>\n<p>Which brings us to the photographic leverage that A.M.I. listed. If you didn’t think it could get any worse than <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jeff-bezos-leaked-texts-investigation\">“alive girl,”</a> beware, cursed images described herein:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Mr. Bezos face selfie at what appears to be a business meeting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ms. Sanchez response &#8212; a photograph of her smoking a cigar in what appears to be a simulated oral sex scene.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A shirtless Mr. Bezos holding his phone in his left hand &#8212; while wearing his wedding ring. He’s wearing either tight black cargo pants\nor shorts &#8212; and his semi-erect manhood is penetrating the zipper of\nsaid garment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A full-length body selfie of Mr. Bezos wearing just a pair of tight black boxer-briefs or trunks, with his phone in his left hand &#8212; while\nwearing his wedding ring.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A selfie of Mr. Bezos fully clothed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A full-length scantily-clad body shot with short trunks.  ·</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A naked selfie in a bathroom &#8212; while wearing his wedding ring. Mr. Bezos is wearing nothing but a white towel &#8212; and the top of his pubic\nregion can be seen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ms. Sanchez wearing a plunging red neckline dress revealing her cleavage and a glimpse of her nether region.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ms. Sanchez wearing a two-piece red bikini with gold detail dress revealing her cleavage.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Per one of the e-mails published by Bezos, A.M.I. said releasing these photos now would not be politically motivated; Amazon shareholders deserve to know what its chief has been up to. The texts and pictures are newsworthy in other words, and they have a protected right to publish them. They just needed Bezos to agree publicly that they weren’t tailing him for the president’s benefit or else.</p>\n<p>Bezos and his lawyers disagree. The story already broke, he writes in a number of words. The pictures would be superfluous, and plus, he owns the dick pics because he took them, and publishing the photos would constitute copyright infringement. Who knows how any of these arguments would each hold up in court, but wow, again I’m feeling something odd in my gut, something I’ve never felt before. Is it? Could it be? Compassion? For a billionaire?</p>\n<p>Strange to feel sympathy for the richest person in history, isn’t it? It’s not how anyone except, like, Mr. Burns would expect to spend their Thursday night. We’re much more used to our billionaires being out here <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/26/koch-brothers-americans-for-prosperity-rightwing-political-group\">flooding elections with cash</a> and trying to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-07/stop-demeaning-billionaires-such-as-howard-schultz\">suggest that the word itself</a> is some kind of slur. Bezos, the biggest billionaire, is trying to stave off a blackmailer. He’s trying to maintain our shared innocence about what “tight black cargo pants or shorts” could possibly mean. He’s just trying to keep his modesty from entering the cultural conscious against his will and everyone else’s will&#8212;everyone’s will save for that of a man named Pecker.</p>\n<p>I take a little heart in the fact that it’s not a purely sympathetic response for this man, whose personal foibles and professional tactics have been covered at length. It’s a selfish, projecting kind of sympathy. We can’t make money like Bezos makes money, but we can send nudes. Some of us can even send dick pics! We are all vulnerable, our photos and our Internet histories are on the cloud just waiting for some enterprising person to hack us or betray us on a whim. Even the guy who <em>owns</em> cloud storage was not immune. What I’m saying is that, in a way, his dick pics are <em>our</em> dick pics. Our dick pics are his dick pics.</p>\n<p>Wouldn’t it be great, goes the thought experiment, that if we were in Bezos’s position and those photos were in danger of being seen by our grandmothers, we could write a Medium post and have half the Internet cheering us on against this complicated, but certainly nefarious foe? Wouldn’t it be great to checkmate the blackmailer, to have gathered certain information about certain dinners with chairmen and certain presidents? Wouldn’t it be great to blog on Medium and have people actually read it?</p>\n<p>This sympathy won’t last long, certainly. I give it as long as it takes for Bezos to bury Pecker, and not a day more.

easily,” gushes one analyst.","body":"<p>The past few weeks have been pretty tough on billionaire <strong>Jeff Bezos,</strong> at least relative to his usual circumstances, and not those of, say, people who work in coal mines or <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2014/02/23/worse_than_wal_mart_amazons_sick_brutality_and_secret_history_of_ruthlessly_intimidating_workers/\">Amazon</a> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-warehouse-workers-share-their-horror-stories-2018-4\">warehouses</a>. In January, he and his wife of 25 years, <strong>MacKenzie Bezos,</strong> announced they were splitting up, in what could be the most expensive divorce in human history. Shortly thereafter, <em>The National Enquirer</em> published a story revealing his affair with <strong>Lauren Sanchez,</strong> and the sexts that went with it. Then, earlier this month, <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> tabloid of choice allegedly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-ami-medium\">tried to blackmail the tech founder</a>, threatening to publish, among other things, a “below the belt selfie &#8212; otherwise colloquially known as a ‘d--k pick [sic],” unless Bezos agreed to drop his investigation into how his private correspondence ended up in the <em>Enquirer</em>’s hands.</p>\n<p>Normally, if the C.E.O. of a public company was caught in a scandal involving photos of his genitalia, the board would be under intense pressure by shareholders to say <em>you gotta go,</em> with Wall Street analysts writing concerned notes to clients about said C.E.O.’s ability to focus in the midst of thousands of stories being written about his penis. Luckily for Bezos, that hasn’t happened, because 1) he’s the chairman of Amazon’s board, and 2) Wall Street apparently believes he has the unique ability to juggle running multiple businesses and nude-selfie drama all at once.</p>\n<p>“Bezos is an individual who has the capacity to work on multiple fronts at the same time. He doesn’t get distracted easily,” gushed <strong>Tom Forte,</strong> an analyst at D.A. Davidson who sees the Amazon’s stock price rising to $2,450 a share, in comments to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/08/investing/amazon-stock/index.html\">CNN</a>. “Look at his ability to concurrently advance Amazon, own <em>The Washington Post,</em> and develop Blue Origin from scratch. That has in no way detracted from his ability to run Amazon.” <strong>Norm Conley,</strong> C.E.O. of JAG Capital Management, agreed, saying he would not be selling his shares. Bezos, he added, is “a genius.” While conceding that “from a public-relations standpoint,” the whole thing is not “ideal,” <strong>Anthony DiClemente,</strong> senior managing director at Evercore ISI, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/amazon-analysts-shrug-off-bezos-enquirer-saga-see-no-impact-on-the-stock.html\">told</a> CNBC, “I don’t think the allegations have a direct line into the fundamentals of Amazon.” <strong>Ron Josey,</strong> an Internet analyst at JMP Securities, concurred, saying he “would be surprised if it had a negative impact on Amazon.” (Amazon’s stock has fallen approximately 5 percent since the day before Bezos announced his intent to divorce, though, per CNBC, the reason for the decline “is likely the company’s warning during the earnings call last week of increased spending and slowing growth in 2019.”)</p>\n<p>Of course, strong fundamentals and a penchant for multi-tasking likely aren‘t the only reasons analysts are sticking with Bezos. Their resilience probably also has something to do with the fact that, in taking the story into his own hands, Bezos is standing up to a “journalistic” enterprise that ranks several notches below the parasites that feed on pond scum&#8212;and, by proxy, its biggest presidential fan.</p>\n<p>“Bezos is that extraordinary, and Amazon is that extraordinary, that he can bring down a bully,” <strong>Davia Temin,</strong> founder of crisis-management firm Temin and Co, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-08/jeff-bezos-extortion-and-embarrassing-pics-won-t-distract-me\">told</a> Bloomberg. “He’s got the courage, and the position as the richest man in the United States, and I think his courage in standing up to the extortion is going to outweigh the details behind the extortion.” Is he still the founder of a company known for decimating competitors and grinding workers into the dirt? Sure! Would the tabloid fracas in which he is currently embroiled have taken down any other, equally horny exec? Probably! But with Bezos, the dick-pic moxie is strong.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Report: rich people on high alert for dick-pic leaks in wake Bezos scandal</strong></p>\n<p>Bezos may have the support of shareholders and a level of wealth at which he is, as Bloomberg’s <strong>Matt Levine</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-08/you-have-to-know-whose-data-you-re-using\">put it</a>, “too rich to be embarrassed,” but not everyone enjoys those comforts. And presumably, those who don’t are <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/02/08/bezos-selfie-leak-triggers-an-alarm-for-billionaires-everywhere/?xid=gn_editorspicks\">planning accordingly right about now</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Jeff Bezos alleged in a blog post Thursday that he was the victim of blackmail attempts by the publisher of <em>The National Enquirer,</em> it probably sent chills down the spines of billionaires everywhere. . . . Ask any family office about its biggest fears and cyber-security is near the top. Personal protection no longer involves just bodyguards and a top-notch alarm system. The Internet Age has seen a massive shift in people storing their most sensitive and personal data online, where it’s vulnerable to hacking and intrusion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“The perception among very affluent people is often, ‘I have this level of wealth, I’m untouchable,’” <strong>Mark Johnson,</strong> chief executive officer of Sovereign Intelligence, told Bloomberg. “But the systems they have in place for protecting their personal identifiable information are very weak.” On the bright side, this whole Bezos situation will presumably result in a jobs boom for security experts who can keep, for instance, <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> or <strong>Bill Gates’s</strong> nudes on lockdown.</p>\n<p><strong>Jared Kushner is going on a road trip</strong></p>\n<p>It’s through the Middle East to promote his “peace plan,” and apparently includes a pit stop at a special friend‘s:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1093718582159163392\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1093718582159163392\">https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1093718582159163392</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Kushner, as you may recall, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia\">is tight</a> with Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman,</strong> who U.S. intelligence agencies say ordered the killing of journalist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi. That friendship came in handy when Donald Trump effectively <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/unusual-statement-disputing-cia-filled-exclamation-points-trump-backs-saudi-n938526\">decided to let the kingdom get away with murder</a> and is apparently <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/08/politics/white-house-khashoggi-deadline/index.html\">still going strong</a> despite a rather damning <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/us/politics/khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman.html\">new report</a> from <em>The New York Times</em> detailing audio of a conversation in which bin Salman reportedly said he would go after Khashoggi “with a bullet.”</p>\n<p><strong>Steve Cohen begging someone to take Midtown duplex off his hands</strong></p>\n<p>In fact, he’s <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-08/steve-cohen-has-cut-price-of-nyc-apartment-60-to-45-million\">practically giving it away at this point</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The billionaire has dropped the price of his Midtown Manhattan duplex more than six times in six years and is now asking $45 million for the apartment&#8212;a $70 million discount to the $115 million he originally listed it for in April 2013.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cohen, the founder of Point72 Asset Management, bought the five-bedroom unit in One Beacon Court between 58th and 59th Streets for $24 million in 2005. He hired architect Charles Gwathmey, who renovated the Guggenheim Museum, to work on the 9,000-square-foot space. The apartment is the only duplex in the building.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to broker <strong>Victoria Shtainer,</strong> prospective buyers will theoretically be banging down Cohen’s door. “He finally got it right, and the market will show him that,” she told Bloomberg.</p>\n<p><strong>Reminder: Trump hates illegal immigrants unless they’re working in one of his businesses</strong></p>\n<p>Stop us if you’ve <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/my-whole-town-practically-lived-there-from-costa-rica-to-new-jersey-a-pipeline-of-illegal-workers-for-trump-goes-back-years/2019/02/08/8cdbc1dc-2971-11e9-97b3-ae59fbae7960_story.html\">heard this one before</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The Washington Post</em> spoke with 16 men and women from Costa Rica and other Latin American countries, including six in Santa Teresa de Cajon, who said they were employed at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster.

In Bound Brook, a majority-Hispanic town where many of the area’s blue-collar workers live, the presence of illegal workers on Trump’s staff was widely known, according to people in the community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It was far more systematic than two or three housekeepers,” said <strong>Joyce Phipps,</strong> executive director of Casa de Esperanza, a legal-aid organization for immigrants, who said she has had several clients who were Bedminster employees. “It’s been a very open secret.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a statement, the Trump Organization told the <em>Post:</em> “We have tens of thousands of employees across our properties and have very strict hiring practices. If any employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately. We take this issue very seriously.”</p>\n<p><strong>Republicans: if Democrats are allowed to see Trump’s tax returns, no one will be safe!</strong></p>\n<p>“This isn’t about the tax returns of presidents and vice presidents, but about making sure Congress does not abuse its authority,” <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-tax-returns-republicans-letter-democrats-1323466\">wrote</a> Representatives <strong>Mike Kelly</strong> and <strong>Kevin Brady</strong> in a letter arguing that the president’s tax returns&#8212;the ones he himself promised to release but strangely never has&#8212;must stay under lock and key. “Where does it end?” Kelly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/us/politics/democrats-trump-tax-returns.html\">asked</a> during a hearing on Thursday, insisting it’s a slippery slope between allowing Democrats to see the <em>president’s</em> taxes, and the tax returns of every private American going public. “What about the tax returns of the Speaker? Members of Congress? Federal employees? Or, for that matter, any political donors? There is no end in sight for those whose tax information may be in jeopardy.” Of course, there is an end in sight, and it’s in the White House, whose inhabitant’s tax returns are the only ones Democrats are interested in seeing, on account of that whole <em>New York Times</em> investigation accusing Trump of “outright“ tax fraud, among other things. But desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>\n<p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>New Evidence Emerges of Possible Wrongdoing by Trump Inaugural Committee (<a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-new-evidence-emerges-of-possible-wrongdoing-by-trump-inaugural-committee\">ProPublica</a>)</p>\n<p>Liberal Billionaire Threatens to Unseat Democrats Who Don’t Impeach Trump (<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/tom-steyer-donald-trump-impeachment-pac\">The Hive</a>)</p>\n<p>Wall Street Fears Trump’s Trade War Is About to Get Worse (<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/wall-street-fears-trumps-trade-war-is-about-to-get-worse\">The Hive</a>)</p>\n<p>Bank of America boosts C.E.O. <strong>Brian Moynihan’s</strong> pay 15 percent to $26.5 million after record profit last year (<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/bofa-ceo-moynihan-gets-raise-to-tk-million-for-record-2018-profit.html\">CNBC</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s</strong> Green New Deal includes a federal jobs guarantee (<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-new-green-deal-jobs-guarantee-what-to-expect.html\">CNBC</a>)</p>\n<p>Student’s Funds Seized After Paying $500,000 Rent on Penthouse (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-07/student-s-funds-seized-after-paying-500-000-rent-on-penthouse\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>IHOP debuting “Pancizzas” in honor of National Pizza Day (<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/02/08/ihop-debuting-pancizzas-in-honor-of-national-pizza-day/\"><em>N.Y.P.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>The Church with the $6 Billion Portfolio (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/nyregion/trinity-church-manhattan-real-estate.html\"><em>N.Y.T.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Amazon Reconsiders NY Expansion Plans Amid Opposition (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-08/amazon-reconsidering-nyc-headquarters-after-opposition-wapo\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>Anyone in the Market for a 5-Bedroom, 2.5-Bathroom Suburban Sex Palace?

threatened to release nudes if he didn’t make a public statement supporting A.M.I.","body":"<p>Last month, the Daily Beast <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jeff-bezos-leaked-texts-investigation\">reported</a> that tech billionaire <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> had launched an investigation to determine how his private messages with a woman who was not his wife ended up in the pages of <em>The National Enquirer,</em> the hunch being that it was a politically motivated hit job. That Bezos, the richest man in the world, would put resources into determining how his sexts with <strong>Lauren Sanchez</strong> found their way into the world’s sleaziest tabloid was not entirely surprising, and is probably what anyone else in his position would to do, too. That he would publish <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">a lengthy post on Medium</a> revealing the <em>Enquirer</em>’s attempts to seemingly extort him if he didn’t drop the investigation was a bit more unexpected!</p>\n<p>According to Bezos’s post, his legal and investigatory team was approached by American Media Inc., publisher of <em>The National Enquirer,</em> with a demand to halt their investigation and tell the press they had “no knowledge or basis for suggesting that A.M.I.’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.” And if Bezos refused? Well, A.M.I. would have no choice but to make certain photos, detailed by its “Chief Content Officer” in the e-mail below, public:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From: Howard, Dylan [dhoward@amilink.com] (Chief Content Officer, A.M.I.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sent: Tuesday, February 5, 2019, 3:33 P.M.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To: Martin Singer (litigation counsel for Mr. de Becker)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Subject: Jeff Bezos &amp; Ms. Lauren Sanchez Photos</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CONFIDENTIAL &amp; NOT FOR DISTRIBIUTION [sic]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Marty:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am leaving the office for the night. I will be available on my cell &#8212; 917 XXX-XXXX.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, in the interests of expediating this situation, and with <em>The Washington Post</em> poised to publish unsubstantiated rumors of <em>The National Enquirer</em>’s initial report, I wanted to describe to you the photos obtained during our newsgathering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the “below the belt selfie &#8212; otherwise colloquially known as a ‘d--k pick’” &#8212; the <em>Enquirer</em> obtained a further nine images. These include:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>· Mr. Bezos face selfie at what appears to be a business meeting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>· Ms. Sanchez response &#8212; a photograph of her smoking a cigar in what appears to be a simulated oral sex scene.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>· A shirtless Mr. Bezos holding his phone in his left hand &#8212; while wearing his wedding ring. He’s wearing either tight black cargo pants or shorts &#8212; and his semi-erect manhood is penetrating the zipper of said garment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>· A full-length body selfie of Mr. Bezos wearing just a pair of tight black boxer-briefs or trunks, with his phone in his left hand &#8212; while wearing his wedding ring.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>· A selfie of Mr. Bezos fully clothed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>· A full-length scantily-clad body shot with short trunks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>· A naked selfie in a bathroom &#8212; while wearing his wedding ring. Mr. Bezos is wearing nothing but a white towel &#8212; and the top of his pubic region can be seen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>· Ms. Sanchez wearing a plunging red neckline dress revealing her cleavage and a glimpse of her nether region.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>· Ms. Sanchez wearing a two-piece red bikini with gold detail dress revealing her cleavage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It would give no editor pleasure to send this e-mail. I hope common sense can prevail &#8212; and quickly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dylan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In another e-mail, A.M.I.’s legal counsel lays out the terms of the extortion a bit more precisely:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From: Fine, Jon [jfine@amilink.com] (Deputy General Counsel, A.M.I.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sent: Wednesday, February 6, 2019, 5:57 P.M.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To: Martin Singer (Mr de Becker’s attorney)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Subject: Re: EXTERNAL* RE: Bezos et al. / American Media et al.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Marty -</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here are our proposed terms:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>A full and complete mutual release of all claims that American Media, on the one hand, and Jeff Bezos and <strong>Gavin de Becker</strong> (the “Bezos Parties”), on the other, may have against each other.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>A public, mutually-agreed upon acknowledgment from the Bezos Parties, released through a mutually-agreeable news outlet, affirming that they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that A.M.’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces, and an agreement that they will cease referring to such a possibility.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>A.M. agrees not to publish, distribute, share, or describe unpublished texts and photos (the “Unpublished Materials”).</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>A.M. affirms that it undertook no electronic eavesdropping in connection with its reporting and has no knowledge of such conduct.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>The agreement is completely confidential.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>In the case of a breach of the agreement by one or more of the Bezos Parties, A.M. is released from its obligations under the agreement, and may publish the Unpublished Materials.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Any other disputes arising out of this agreement shall first be submitted to JAMS mediation in California</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jon</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately for Trump’s favorite publication, Bezos chose not to comply. “These communications cement A.M.I.’s long-earned reputation for weaponizing journalistic privileges, hiding behind important protections, and ignoring the tenets and purpose of true journalism,” Bezos wrote, explaining his decision. “Of course I don’t want personal photos published, but I also won’t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.”</p>\n<p>A.M.I. is currently embroiled in a legal controversy involving publisher <strong>David Pecker’s</strong> friendship with <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and the <em>Enquirer</em>’s alleged practice of “catch and kill,” or purposefully buying and burying incriminating stories. In August, Pecker cut an immunity deal with federal prosecutors who are probing an incident in which Trump’s former attorney, <strong>Michael Cohen,</strong> negotiated a hush-money payment with A.M.I. to bury allegations by former <em>Playboy</em> model <strong>Karen McDougal</strong> that she had an affair with Trump. (Trump has denied the claim.) Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign-finance violations related to his role in facilitating payments to McDougal and to porn actress <strong>Stormy Daniels.</strong></p>\n<p>In a statement, A.M.I. said: “American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos.   Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him.  Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims.  Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.”</p>","rubric":"Blackmail","socialTitle":"Jeff Bezos Accuses National Enquirer of “D*ck Pick”

takes on David Pecker, Trump’s favorite tabloid may have finally met its match.","body":"<p>American Media Inc., the parent company of <em>The National Enquirer,</em> is under heavy scrutiny following <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-ami-medium\">explosive allegations</a> that it attempted to blackmail Amazon founder <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong>&#8212;and, according to a former <em>Enquirer</em> editor, the tabloid may be in over its head. “I think they thought they were smarter than they are,” <strong>Jerry George,</strong> the tabloid’s former Los Angeles bureau chief, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/donlemoncnn/videos/848877438777334/\">told</a> CNN Thursday night. “And I think now the reality is hitting them and they’re freaking out.”</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">blog post</a> published Thursday evening, Bezos claimed that A.M.I., whose <em>Enquirer</em> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-alleged-relationship\">reported</a> on his affair with television anchor <strong>Lauren Sanchez,</strong> attempted to stop his investigation into how the tabloid had obtained his sensitive text messages by threatening to release intimate photos of the Amazon chief and <em>Washington Post</em> publisher. The apparent threat, as George noted, could open A.M.I. up to legal vulnerability&#8212;and comes after the company, whose C.E.O., <strong>David Pecker,</strong> is a close ally of <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> is still dealing with the fallout from its alleged role in quashing stories of women who claimed to have had affairs with the then-candidate.</p>\n<p>In 2016, the company purchased the story of <strong>Karen McDougal,</strong> a former Playboy model who claimed she’d had an affair with Trump, with no intention of running it. The “catch and kill” deal was arranged by <strong>Michael Cohen,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/cohens-guilty-plea-came-together-very-fast\">pleaded guilty</a> to campaign-finance violations last year related to his efforts to silence McDougal and porn actress <strong>Stormy Daniels.</strong> (Trump has repeatedly denied both affairs.) A.M.I. avoided prosecution as part of the scandal by <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/donald-trump-national-enquirer-allies-defect-david-pecker-michael-cohen\">agreeing</a> to cooperate with investigators&#8212;a move that, per my colleague <strong>Gabriel Sherman,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/donald-trump-national-enquirer-allies-defect-david-pecker-michael-cohen\">stunned</a> Trump’s allies&#8212;“Holy shit,” a Trump friend told Sherman, “I thought Pecker would be the last one to turn.” (Pecker did not respond to Sherman’s request for comment.)</p>\n<p>But the apparent effort to blackmail Bezos&#8212;who has been repeatedly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1084627451983073280\">bashed by Trump</a> due to his ownership of the <em>Post</em>&#8212;suggests the company’s shady behavior has continued. After Bezos revealed the alleged extortion effort, journalist <strong>Ronan Farrow,</strong> who famously <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-a-playboy-model-and-a-system-for-concealing-infidelity-national-enquirer-karen-mcdougal\">reported</a> on A.M.I.’s role in the McDougal saga for <em>The New Yorker,</em> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RonanFarrow/status/1093690150448758784\">tweeted</a> that he, too, had been the subject of a potential blackmail campaign by the company, in an effort to quash an investigation. He also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RonanFarrow/status/1093734749821194241\">wrote</a> that, according to his previous reporting, <strong>Dylan Howard,</strong> the <em>Enquirer</em> editor who attempted to turn up the heat on Bezos, is a close ally of <strong>Harvey Weinstein’s</strong> and spearheaded a “secret collaboration with . . . Weinstein to dig up dirt on accusers.” (In a lengthy statement to Farrow, Howard <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies\">maintained</a> that his relationship with Weinstein was professional and aboveboard; a spokesperson for Weinstein told Farrow that Howard “served as the point person for American Media’s long-standing business relationship with The Weinstein Company.”) He added, “I did not engage as I don’t cut deals with subjects of ongoing reporting.”</p>\n<p>On CNN, George theorized that the <em>Enquirer</em>’s efforts were connected to the president: “For years, Donald Trump has had a hard-on for Bezos,” he said. “Professional jealousy, the acquisition of Amazon . . . so it’s no surprise that he turned to his good buddy David Pecker . . . to do a hatchet job on him.” And yet it’s not clear whether the tabloid acted on Trump’s behalf&#8212;back in August, a source close to A.M.I. told Sherman that he and Pecker hadn’t spoken in months, and that Howard was “particularly angry” at the president, and felt “used and abused by him” after the feds subpoenaed his employer. (Howard did not respond to Sherman’s request for comment.)</p>\n<p>It’s equally unclear whether A.M.I.’s alleged threat constitutes a crime. The company has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/national-enquirer-publisher-believes-it-acted-lawfully-on-bezos-story-vows-to-investigate-matter.html\">maintained</a> it acted lawfully, and said that at the time of Bezos’s allegations, it was in “good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him.” But when the question was posed to him, <em>New Yorker</em> legal expert <strong>Jeffrey Toobin</strong> <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/cnn/rs-feb-07-2019?e=189f30aee3\">replied</a>, “I don’t know.” It’s a question that will be of particular concern to the publication in the coming days, especially considering Bezos’s allusion to others who have contacted his investigation team about “similar experiences with A.M.I.” A source familiar with the <em>Enquirer</em> <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/cnn/rs-feb-07-2019?e=189f30aee3\">told</a> CNN’s <strong>Brian Stelter</strong> there are indeed other such stories, predicting ominously: “It will all come out now.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

Now he’s at the heart of a complexifier-ridden Hollywood-Silicon Valley-D.C. drama.","body":"<p>Until <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">accused</a> <em>National Enquirer</em> parent company American Media Inc. of extortion last week, <strong>Michael Sanchez,</strong> the brother of Bezos’s mistress, <strong>Lauren Sanchez,</strong> was known as a minor player on the margins of the entertainment industry. Michael had worked at ICM and MTV before becoming a talent manager and publicist, and his biggest client seemed to be his sister&#8212;a former television host-turned-helicopter entrepreneur who was married to William Morris Endeavor co-C.E.O. <strong>Patrick Whitesell.</strong></p>\n<p>But Michael Sanchez has since become a central character in the Bezos marriage drama. In late January, the Amazon founder and C.E.O.’s longtime security chief, <strong>Gavin de Becker,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/bezos-investigators-question-the-brother-of-his-mistress-lauren-sanchez-in-national-enquirer-leak-probe\">publicly suggested</a> that Michael Sanchez was possibly the <em>Enquirer</em>’s initial source of information on Bezos’s relationship with his sister. De Becker cited “political motives,” as Michael is an avid <strong>Donald Trump</strong> supporter who could be imagined to have such motive to embarrass Bezos, who also owns <em>The Washington Post</em> (Michael’s friends include <strong>Roger Stone</strong> and <strong>Carter Page</strong>). On Tuesday, the Associated Press <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/e199a6dd14aa4ac7808f58af842f948e\">reported</a> that de Becker’s investigation had confirmed that Michael leaked Bezos and Lauren’s intimate text messages. The matter is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/business/media/jeff-bezos-ami-national-enquirer-fight.html\">being investigated</a> by federal prosecutors.</p>\n<p>In a series of interviews this week, Michael Sanchez carefully parsed his involvement in the imbroglio and provided his own counter-narrative. Specifically, he denied any involvement in the leak of the “below-the-belt selfies” that are at the core of Bezos’s extortion claim, not to mention a possible crime. “I had <em>nothing</em> to do with leak of the dick pics. That’s the important thing,” Michael told me. “I never had access. It’s clear they were sent to others. There are, like, 20 dick pics. Lauren likely shared them with multiple girlfriends, not in a malicious way, that’s not her style, but when she’s in love, she got a kick out of sharing them. One time she tried to show me one and I was like, ‘What the fuck is wrong with you? I don’t want to see that!’”</p>\n<p>Michael was less declarative when I asked if he’d leaked his sister and Bezos’s intensely intimate texts, as the <em>Daily Beast</em> had first reported. (“I love you, alive girl. I will show you with my body, and my lips and my eyes, very soon,” Bezos allegedly wrote.) “I’m not saying I didn’t do <em>something,</em>” Michael told me. “Until I go under oath, what I can tell you now is that ever since April 20, when I met Jeff, my only goal has been to protect Jeff and Lauren.” (A spokesperson for Amazon declined to comment. Gavin de Becker did not return a call seeking comment.)</p>\n<p>Michael’s claim that he is acting in Bezos’s best interest is difficult to fathom given that he’s been accused by de Becker as being the leaker and has maintained a friendly relationship with A.M.I. for years. But Michael insisted he “loves Jeff” and wants his sister’s relationship to succeed. Over the last year, he said, he served as an unofficial adviser to the couple as they discussed what would happen if their love affair leaked. “They were talking marriage,” he told me. “The three of us had discussed before that, at some point, this was going to be a scandal. My advice was, let’s get to the other side. Our analogy was always that they were landing a 747. I told them, ‘You’re both pilots and you’ve never landed a 747, but that’s what we’re trying to do here.’”</p>\n<p>In October, Lauren and Bezos had their first publicity scare when they spotted a paparazzo taking long-lens photos of them from the Santa Monica beach. Then, at dinner at Santa Monica restaurant Capo, Lauren noticed a reporter snapping photos of their table. Michael said they were increasingly nervous when they left the restaurant and Bezos’s car hadn’t arrived. “We were literally standing on the street with Jeff Bezos and his mistress. I got very protective of him. I said, ‘We need to get you into an Uber,’” Michael recalled.</p>\n<p>Two months later, they were outed. On the morning of January 7, Michael was on a Caribbean cruise when he was alerted that the <em>Enquirer</em> had called Bezos and Lauren for comment on their affair. “Lauren and Jeff called me like 911. They were terrified,” Michael recalled. According to Michael, they discussed various options regarding how to respond to the story. One option even included Bezos buying A.M.I.&#8212;not such an outlandish consideration given the seriousness of the breach and the fact that, for Bezos, the price of the tabloid company is essentially a rounding error&#8212;to find out the source of the leak. “We discussed the possibility to buy A.M.I.&#8212;not to kill the story, but to find out the source. They said that’s not a bad idea. We discussed numbers and the name of the LLC that we’d use. It would be called BOBO LCC”&#8212;short for Lauren’s helicopter filming company, Black Ops, and Bezos’s space company, Blue Origin&#8212;“that’s the level of detail we went into.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, according to Michael, they settled on the plan that Michael would fly to New York on January 8 to meet with <em>Enquirer</em> editor <strong>Dylan Howard</strong> and find out what the tabloid planned to publish. But Bezos seemed to have changed his mind and went on the offensive, retaining powerhouse Los Angeles litigator <strong>Marty Singer.</strong> Early on the morning of January 9, before Michael met with Howard, Bezos tweeted out that he was divorcing his wife, <strong>MacKenzie.</strong> “Lauren was blindsided by the tweet,” Michael told me.</p>\n<p>Michael blamed de Becker for the strategy shift, which he viewed as a dangerous escalation of the situation, and accused Bezos’s security chief of having selfish motives. The two advisers have been at odds in the press since the <em>Enquirer</em> published its exposé. “Lauren calls it a cockfight,” Michael said. The agendas of the opposing camps have produced competing theories as to who is to blame. In his <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">Medium post</a>, Bezos suggested a vast conspiracy involving Trump and Saudi Arabia and the possibility that his communications were hacked to damage him as payback for <em>The Washington Post</em>’s crusading investigation into the murder of <em>Post</em> columnist Jamal Khashoggi.</p>\n<p>But Michael Sanchez said Bezos and de Becker are framing the scandal as a pro-Trump political hit job to distract the public from a far simpler story: Bezos cheated on his wife and de Becker’s security apparatus couldn’t prevent Bezos from being caught. Michael said de Becker’s judgment is clouded because he has been trying to break Lauren and Bezos up to protect MacKenzie Bezos, a close de Becker friend. De Becker reportedly told Bezos to agree to a 30-day physical separation from Lauren.</p>\n<p>Michael told me that his sister and Bezos continue to speak frequently and that the scandal “brought them closer together.” Another source close to Lauren confirmed she’s in contact with Bezos. “The truth will come out about my motivations and how much I believe in Jeff and Lauren’s love,” Michael Sanchez told me. “It’s a legendary romance that will blow your mind as to just how in love they are.

All of this likely contributed to Bezos’s joint announcement with his wife <strong>MacKenzie Bezos</strong> (née Tuttle), that the two would be divorcing after 25 years of marriage. And now, the world’s richest man is launching a full-on investigation to determine exactly how the universe came to know that his idea of dirty text message is “I want to smell you” and, most disturbingly, “I love you, alive girl.”</p>\n<p>The Daily Beast <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/bezos-launches-investigation-into-leaked-texts-with-lauren-sanchez-that-killed-his-marriage\">reports</a> that Bezos‘s personal security team has been working to determine how the Amazon founder and <em>Washington Post</em> owner’s private messages ended up in the pages of the world’s sleaziest tabloid. Thus far, they don’t believe it to be simply a case of Bezos’s phone being hacked, as a digital forensic analysis showed no evidence of such a breach. The team also looked into the possibility that Sanchez herself leaked the messages, but that theory, too, was unsupported by any evidence. Which leaves Bezos with a third theory that his security team is increasingly convinced could be legit: this whole thing was a political hit job, on account of his not-so-great relationship with <strong>Donald Trump:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That avenue of investigation stems from Bezos’s new role as a punching bag for President Donald Trump. The president gleefully promoted the <em>Enquirer</em>’s story, using it to hammer Bezos over his ownership of <em>The Washington Post,</em> which Trump frequently maligns as a hostile advocacy arm of Amazon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The fact that the texts ended up at the <em>Enquirer</em> has fueled Bezos’s investigators’ suspicions that the leak was politically motivated. The tabloid’s chief executive, <strong>David Pecker,</strong> admitted last month to using the <em>Enquirer</em> to facilitate a hush-money payment to one of Trump’s alleged mistresses during the final weeks of the 2016 campaign. Pecker is a longtime Trump friend and ally, and [the] tone of his publication’s coverage&#8212;it labeled Bezos a “schmuck” in one story, for example&#8212;has struck investigators as even more venomous than typical <em>Enquirer</em> fare.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, given that Pecker and his publication have made “a concerted effort to distance themselves publicly from the president, and abruptly halted their previously routine, glowing coverage of Trump,” it’s possible the tabloid <em>wouldn’t</em> go after Bezos just because <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/donald-trump-amazon-postal-service\">the president thinks Amazon is running some kind of scam on the Post Office</a>. Maybe they just thought it would sell papers.</p>\n<p><strong>Jon Hammond,</strong> a spokesman for <em>Enquirer</em> parent company American Media Inc., declined the Daily Beast’s request for comment, as did an Amazon spokesman.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

wonder why getting Bezos to back off was so important.","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>In mid-January, when <em>The National Enquirer</em> <a href=\"https://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-text-messages-affair-scandal/\">published</a> its epic exposé revealing <strong>Jeff Bezos’s</strong> months-long extramarital dalliance, it was one of those once-every-so-often moments of mainstream credibility for the notorious supermarket tabloid. Bezos, after all, is the richest man in the world and the founder of a trillion-dollar company that has revolutionized the way we live, shop, and consume media. Some of the <em>Enquirer</em>’s language and packaging (steamy text messages and surreptitious dinner-date photos) was typically tawdry&#8212;but the fact that Bezos was having an affair and divorcing his wife of 25 years was major news no matter how you sliced it. The <em>Enquirer,</em> it seemed, had landed the scoop fair and square. Serious journalists were paying attention to the story, and talking about what it meant for Amazon, for Bezos’s reputation, and, of course, for the <em>Enquirer.</em></p>\n<p>For much of the previous year, the publication had been mired in a legal and public-relations crisis of its own making, thanks to its apparent role in muzzling women who alleged they’d had affairs with President <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> a longtime pal of <strong>David Pecker,</strong> who is chairman and C.E.O. of the <em>Enquirer</em>’s parent company, American Media Inc. Now, in the wake of that ignominy, here was a massive newsbreak that put the <em>Enquirer</em> at the center of the news cycle in precisely the way it wanted to be. This was just what the tabloid needed given its recent history of dwindling circulation and staggering political scandal. It was proof that the <em>Enquirer</em> could still shine light on the misbehavior of the powerful, just as it had when it brought down <strong>John Edwards</strong> in 2007 through an <a href=\"https://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/john-edwards-love-child-scandal/\">exhaustive investigation</a> into the cover-up of the onetime presidential hopeful’s love child. It looked like a victory lap following a series of black eyes.</p>\n<p>A month later, to the <em>Enquirer</em>’s consternation, that script has been turned on its head, thanks to Bezos’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/bezos-wins-praise-for-his-essay-in-the-wapo-newsroom\">“ballsy” publication</a> of e-mails that appeared to show A.M.I. attempting to blackmail him with the threat of exposing a dick pic and other embarrassing photos. “In the A.M.I. letters I’m making public,” Bezos wrote in his <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">extraordinary post</a> on the Web site Medium, “you will see the precise details of their extortionate proposal: they will publish the personal photos unless [security consultant] <strong>Gavin de Becker</strong> and I make the specific false public statement to the press that we ‘have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that A.M.I.’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.’ If we do not agree to affirmatively publicize that specific lie, they say they’ll publish the photos, and quickly.”</p>\n<p>The <em>Enquirer</em> now finds itself somewhere it’s not used to being: on the defensive. It’s gone from trying to strong-arm Bezos into calling off the dogs investigating how the <em>Enquirer</em> came to possess his private texts, to becoming the subject of an investigation by the board of its own parent company, which said last week that it “will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.” (The board has retained an outside firm to conduct the probe, according to someone familiar with the matter.) Worse for Pecker, the feds are now re-examining the immunity deal they struck with him last year, over the <em>Enquirer</em>’s involvement with former Trump lawyer <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> in paying off women who claimed to have slept with the president. There are signs, meanwhile, that do seem to point to a potentially politically motivated source. (Bezos owns <em>The Washington Post,</em> whose coverage Trump and his allies are no fans of.) The Daily Beast <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/mistress-lauren-sanchezs-brother-leaked-bezos-racy-texts-to-enquirer-sources-say-7\">reported yesterday</a> that its own sources say the <em>Enquirer</em> got the texts from <strong>Michael Sanchez,</strong> the brother of Bezos’s mistress, who moves in Trumpworld circles. (Sanchez declined to comment to the Beast.) During an interview with ABC’s <strong>George Stephanopoulos</strong> on Sunday, Pecker’s attorney, <strong>Elkan Abramowitz,</strong> described the leaker only as “a reliable source that had given information to <em>The National Enquirer</em> for seven years prior to this story. It was a source that was well known to both Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez.” Abramowitz also insisted that A.M.I. had acted legally in all of its interactions with the Bezos camp. (A.M.I. declined to comment for this story.)</p>\n<p>Even by <em>National Enquirer</em> standards, the whole episode has stunned battle-hardened tabloid veterans who thought they’d seen it all. “The history of tabloid journalism is rife with all sorts of behind-the-scenes deals,” said <strong>George Rush,</strong> the former <em>Daily News</em> gossip columnist. “But to put that offer so bluntly and brazenly, to a man who has the intelligence and power to impale you on your own sword, was stupid.”</p>\n<p>“I’m as mystified as everybody else,” said <strong>Larry Hackett,</strong> the former longtime editor of <em>People</em> magazine. “In light of everything they’re facing, to be operating so close to the edge? I’m not a lawyer, but to put on paper this kind of threat to the richest guy in the world who, also, by the way, owns <em>The Washington Post,</em> it just seems unusual. I think the story today is: why were they so determined and hell-bent to get Bezos to say it’s not political? Here is what the <em>Enquirer</em> is betraying that they don’t normally betray: fear. The fact that they were so adamant to get Bezos to say that this wasn’t political suggests a worry on their part, and nothing we’ve seen in the past few days is gonna make that go away.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>In the media world, the <em>Enquirer</em> has spent the past few decades teetering on and off the brink of legitimacy. Under the stewardship of Harvard-educated editor-in-chief <strong>Steve Coz</strong> in the 1990s, it won acclaim for its dogged <strong>O.J. Simpson</strong> coverage. Similarly, the late-aughts <strong>David Perel</strong> era gave us the <strong>Tiger Woods</strong> cheating scandal and the Edwards affair, which put the <em>Enquirer</em> in the previously unheard of territory of Pulitzer Prize contention. The decades-old scandal sheet was getting favorable coverage from the likes of <em>The New York Times, The Washington Post, GQ</em> and <em>Playboy.</em> But as with all print media, market forces were beginning to work against it. Circulation was on the decline&#8212;it is now reportedly south of 300,000, down from a peak of around 6 million a week in the late 1970s&#8212;and A.M.I. was running into financing troubles that it continues to grapple with today.</p>\n<p>In early 2014, just before current editor-in-chief <strong>Dylan Howard</strong> took over, the <em>Enquirer</em> made waves for an embarrassing episode in which it got conned into running an interview with a prankster pretending to be <strong>David Bar Katz,</strong> a playwright and close friend of Philip Seymour Hoffman, who had just died of a heroin overdose. The fake Katz claimed in the article that he and Hoffman were cocaine-guzzling lovers, which indeed would have been a sizzling <em>Enquirer</em> scoop were it true. There was a correction and a libel settlement, and then-editor <strong>Tony Frost</strong> was ousted shortly after.</p>\n<p>The Howard era began with a much-needed redesign, a merry band of talented new recruits from the tabloid and celebrity-journalism world, a closer relationship with digital sister publication Radar Online, and the promise of returning the <em>Enquirer</em> to its roots of fearless shoe-leather sleuthing and rigid fact-checks, combined with unabashed checkbook journalism. Howard, after all, had bombshells like <strong>Mel Gibson’s</strong> racist rants and <strong>Charlie Sheen’s</strong> drug test under his belt. “It couldn’t have come at a better time,” executive editor <strong>Barry Levine,</strong> who no longer works at the <em>Enquirer,</em> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/media/story/2014/07/the-enquirer-exposed-002583\">told me back then</a>. “We needed a real jolt, something to freshen us up.”</p>\n<p>Trump’s rise as a serious presidential contender in 2015 changed the equation, at least as far as public perception was concerned. The <em>Enquirer,</em> thanks to Trump’s well-known affiliation with Pecker, came under scrutiny for doing kid-gloves coverage of the candidate, while at the same time unleashing a fusillade of stories suggesting that <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2015/10/in-the-enquirer-primary-clintons-campaign-is-dead-literally-214693\">virtually on the brink of death</a>. Even that behavior, though, would pale in comparison to Pecker’s admission last year that his <em>Enquirer</em> had acquired the rights to a <em>Playboy</em> model’s story of having an affair with Trump, only to bury the story in order to help Trump ahead of the 2016 election. Federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York revealed they had agreed not to prosecute American Media Inc. in return for Pecker’s cooperation, and the deal stipulated that going forward, A.M.I. “shall commit no crimes whatsoever.”</p>\n<p>The e-mails that Bezos published last week would appear to suggest that A.M.I. may have already broken that promise. They also appeared to quash any notion that the <em>Enquirer</em> might start cleaning up its act. “I think the story of the world’s richest man getting divorced is a good story. There’s no doubt about that,” said <strong>Martin Dunn,</strong> a former <em>Daily News</em> editor-in-chief who also worked at the notorious British tabloids <em>News of the World</em> and <em>The Sun</em> (and also wrote for the <em>Enquirer</em> under Generoso Pope Jr. in the late 1970s). “But the subsequent interchange between the paper and Bezos is something I’ve never seen before. I have seen many scandals in newspapers in my time, but I’ve never seen a situation where people have been told there’s a quid pro quo like that for stuff being run. That, to me, set a new low bar for tabloid behavior.”</p>\n<p>I asked Dunn how much damage he thinks the Bezos standoff could inflict on the <em>Enquirer</em> long-term. “Look, at the end of the day, it is a shadow of its former self,” he said. “This was a sensational story, and it increased their profile for a short moment, but now it seems to have increased their profile for all the wrong reasons.”</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Media","socialTitle":"“A New Low Bar”: Tabloid Vets Say Blackmailing Bezos Was Inexplicably Stupid","socialDescription":"No one expects the Enquirer to play by the

2014, <strong>Dylan Howard,</strong> a charismatic Australian tabloid hound who had recently been named editor in chief of <em>The National Enquirer,</em> was sinking his teeth into a medium-well New York strip steak at Delmonico’s, down in the Financial District. “I want to break the next <strong>John Edwards</strong> story,” he <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/media/story/2014/07/the-enquirer-exposed-002583\">told me</a> over lunch that day. Howard said the <em>Enquirer</em> was working on a “black-ops” investigation that would “shake the foundations of Washington D.C.” if the story materialized.</p>\n<p>It apparently did not. But four and a half years later, Howard’s <em>Enquirer</em> has shaken the foundations of Washington in a different way. The <em>Enquirer</em>’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/the-bezos-divorce-the-post-tries-to-sift-between-the-gossip-and-the-real-news\">mid-January bombshell</a> exposing <strong>Jeff Bezos’s</strong> months-long affair with <strong>Lauren Sanchez</strong> has put the infamous supermarket mag on a violent collision course with the world’s richest man. Bezos, through his longtime security consultant, <strong>Gavin de Becker,</strong> has been investigating how the <em>Enquirer</em> got its hands on a trove of private text messages between Bezos and Sanchez. De Becker <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/bezos-investigators-question-the-brother-of-his-mistress-lauren-sanchez-in-national-enquirer-leak-probe\">told the Daily Beast</a> that “strong leads point to political motives.” He also confirmed to the Beast that he has looked into <strong>Michael Sanchez,</strong> the brother of Bezos’s mistress, who is an associate of Trumpworld fixtures including <strong>Roger Stone</strong> and <strong>Carter Page.</strong> <strong>David Pecker,</strong> owner of the <em>Enquirer</em>’s parent company, American Media Inc., is a longtime Trump pal who cut an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/us/politics/david-pecker-immunity-trump.html\">immunity deal</a> with federal prosecutors last summer over the <em>Enquirer</em>’s involvement with former Trump lawyer <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> in paying off women who alleged they’d had affairs with the president. (The deal stipulates that as part of the agreement, the <em>Enquirer</em> “shall commit no crimes whatsoever.” Federal prosecutors are now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/1093928245769236480\">reviewing</a> whether A.M.I. violated that deal.) Bezos owns <em>The Washington Post,</em> which Trump frequently attacks over the newspaper’s aggressive coverage of his administration.</p>\n<p>The Bezos-A.M.I. battle went nuclear on Thursday night when the ordinarily taciturn Amazon boss published an <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">extraordinary post</a> on the Web site Medium. “Several days ago, an A.M.I. leader advised us that Mr. Pecker is ‘apoplectic’ about our investigation,” Bezos wrote. “A few days after hearing about Mr. Pecker’s apoplexy, we were approached, verbally at first, with an offer. They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn’t stop our investigation. . . . In the A.M.I. letters I’m making public, you will see the precise details of their extortionate proposal: they will publish the personal photos unless Gavin de Becker and I make the specific false public statement to the press that we ‘have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that A.M.I.’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.’ If we do not agree to affirmatively publicize that specific lie, they say they’ll publish the photos, and quickly.”</p>\n<p>The richest man in the world must have felt as if he held the higher cards: the letters from A.M.I.’s legal representation proposing a deal. “If in my position I can’t stand up to this kind of extortion,” he wrote, “how many people can?” His riveting, rambling essay, built around the e-mails from A.M.I.’s counsel laying out their proposed trade, was a powerful statement about journalism that itself reached a place more intimate and dramatic than journalism can ever go. At its core was an unmistakable claim linking the <em>Post</em>’s coverage of the president with the <em>Enquirer</em>’s story and the deal its attorneys floated. “My ownership of the <em>Washington Post</em> is a complexifier for me,” Bezos wrote. “It’s unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience <em>Washington Post</em> news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy. . . . Be assured, no real journalists ever propose anything like what is happening here: <em>I will not report embarrassing information about you if you do X for me. And if you don’t do X quickly, I will report the embarrassing information.”</em></p>\n<p>Whatever one thinks about Amazon’s predations in other areas, Bezos has earned a reputation as an exemplary newspaper owner and staunch defender of journalism. After buying the <em>Post</em> for $250 million in 2013, he revived its fortunes by investing heavily in technology and newsroom resources. Under his leadership, the Beltway institution has come roaring back as a national media powerhouse, and it has been thriving in the Trump era both journalistically and as a business&#8212;one that now has a strong digital-subscription component. This episode has only bolstered Bezos’s standing within the journalism community, which collectively hopped on Twitter immediately after the Medium post went up to shower him with praise.</p>\n<p>By standing up to the <em>Enquirer</em> at the expense of his own personal privacy&#8212;the e-mails from A.M.I. executives, including Howard, warned that the <em>Enquirer</em> had “a ‘d--k pick’”&#8212;Bezos also seems to have made himself even more popular among his own employees at the <em>Post.</em> “Everyone I’ve talked to thought it was incredibly ballsy,” one <em>Post</em> journalist told me, “and kind of hilarious that we are a ‘complexifier.’” As I <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/the-bezos-divorce-the-post-tries-to-sift-between-the-gossip-and-the-real-news\">reported</a> last month, it was initially unclear how the <em>Post</em> would go about covering the ramifications not only of its owner’s affair, but the manner in which the affair was exposed. Now, the <em>Post</em> has clearly found its angle. On Tuesday, it published a fascinating and revelatory <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/was-tabloid-expose-of-bezos-affair-just-juicy-gossip-or-a-political-hit-job/2019/02/05/03d2f716-2633-11e9-90cd-dedb0c92dc17_story.html\">feature</a> going behind the scenes of the competing theories as to how the <em>Enquirer</em> investigation took shape: “Was tabloid exposé of Bezos affair just juicy gossip or a political hit job?” Thursday night on MSNBC, <em>Post</em> reporter <strong>Manuel Roig-Franzia</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ndrew_lawrence/status/1093715333079318530\">offered up</a> a tidbit that sounded like the most potentially damning statement in the saga thus far: “Gavin de Becker believes it’s possible that a government entity might have gotten hold of [Bezos’s] text messages.”</p>\n<p>Pecker, meanwhile, would appear to be licking his wounds. There’s already <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-08/bezos-allegations-could-upend-american-media-s-deal-with-feds\">speculation</a> that the blackmail allegations could blow up his immunity deal, which expressly warned against illegal activity over the next three years. On Friday morning, A.M.I. issued a cautiously worded statement on the matter: “American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos. Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr. Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him. Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.”</p>\n<p>The <em>Enquirer</em> has never been one to go down without a fight. Back when I spent some time with Howard in 2014, I sat in on a planning meeting during which Howard and his editors trashed a competing gossip outlet that had knocked down a recent <strong>Angelina Jolie</strong> scoop published by the <em>Enquirer.</em> “The great irony is that someone took a cheap shot at us, but they still run the video on their Web site, because they still want the story,” he said, adding sarcastically, “They’ll suffer the consequences!” He followed up with his newsroom’s unofficial motto: “Defeat is not an option.” Bezos and the Southern District of New York may be a different kind of adversary.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

<strong>Jeff Bezos’s</strong> affair with <strong>Lauren Sanchez,</strong> which included private text messages between the two, inspired an obvious yet burning question: who leaked the sexts, and why? Now, <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/mistress-lauren-sanchezs-brother-leaked-bezos-racy-texts-to-enquirer-sources-say-7\">a new report</a> from the Daily Beast has seemingly provided an answer: according to multiple sources inside <em>Enquirer</em> parent company A.M.I., the culprit is Sanchez’s Trump-loving brother, <strong>Michael Sanchez.</strong></p>\n<p>The apparent confirmation comes just days after Bezos’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-ami-medium\">blog post</a> alleging A.M.I. had attempted to extort him, demanding he drop his investigation into how the <em>Enquirer</em> obtained his texts, and publish a statement denying that the tabloid’s motivations were political, or suffer the consequences (the consequences, in this case, being the release of at least one “d--k pick”). How Michael allegedly obtained the messages between his sister and the Amazon founder is still unclear, and as of late January, he <a href=\"https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/money-and-power/a26256501/michael-sanchez-lauren-brother-jeff-bezos-national-enquirer/\">denied</a> having anything to do with the leak. But according to reporter <strong>Lachlan Markay</strong> his motivations sure <em>sound</em> politically motivated!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Documents reviewed by the Daily Beast show that Michael Sanchez believed the <em>Enquirer</em> pursued its story about Bezos with “President Trump’s knowledge and appreciation”&#8212;a chase encouraged, in Sanchez’s estimation, by Republican operatives “who THINK Jeff gets up every morning and has a [<em>Washington Post</em>] meeting to plot its next diabolical attack on President Trump.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He certainly was a reliable and public supporter of the president. “For anyone too stupid or too bitter to admit Mueller’s pack of @POTUS-hating@TheDemocrats is leading an out-of-control witch hunt, read about @jerome_corsi,” Sanchez wrote in a more-or-less typical tweet. “Muellerism = McCarthyism.” According to <em>The Washington Post,</em> Sanchez said he had heard from A.M.I. staffers that the tabloid operation was in the middle of “a takedown to make Trump happy.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In an interview with ABC on Sunday, <strong>Elkan Abramowitz,</strong> a lawyer for A.M.I., told <strong>George Stephanopoulos,</strong> “The story was given to <em>The National Enquirer</em> by a reliable source that had given information to <em>The National Enquirer</em> for seven years prior to this story. It was a source that was well known to both Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez.” Sources familiar with Bezos’s personal investigation, headed up by security consultant <strong>Gavin de Becker,</strong> told the Beast that “There is no one inside this inquiry process who doesn’t believe [Sanchez is] ground zero.” (de Becker reportedly interviewed Sanchez as part of his probe.)</p>\n<p>Of particular interest are Michael Sanchez’s alleged ties to <strong>Roger Stone</strong> and <strong>Carter Page,</strong> both key Trumpworld figures. (Stone is, of course, a former advisor to the Trump campaign who was indicted by the special prosecutor in January. Page was foreign policy adviser to the campaign who has also piqued the interest of <strong>Robert Mueller</strong>.) According to the Daily Beast, de Becker questioned Sanchez about his communications with both men, as well as with <strong>Scottie Nell Hughes,</strong> a pro-Trump commentator who now works for the Russian state television network RT. Stone, who was reportedly in contact with Sanchez in the days after the <em>Enquirer</em> story was published, told the Daily Beast that he has never hacked anyone and said that Michael Sanchez is a “very good guy.”</p>\n<p>If Sanchez is indeed the leaker, many questions still remain to this dick-pic mystery: Why would he betray his sister? Do his ties to people in Trump’s orbit come into play? And what, if anything, is the “Saudi connection”? (In his Medium post, Bezos noted that A.M.I. has “been investigated for various actions they’ve taken on behalf of the Saudi Government,” and noted that the suggestion the <em>Enquirer</em> might be tangled up with the Saudis seemed “to hit a particularly sensitive nerve.”)</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

And after Bezos’s <em>Washington Post</em> published a front-page story on Trump’s efforts to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-has-concealed-details-of-his-face-to-face-encounters-with-putin-from-senior-officials-in-administration/2019/01/12/65f6686c-1434-11e9-b6ad-9cfd62dbb0a8_story.html\">conceal</a> his meetings with <strong>Vladimir Putin,</strong> the president let fly: “So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better &amp; more responsible hands!”</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1084627451983073280\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1084627451983073280\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1084627451983073280</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The Bezoses are&#8212;were&#8212;the richest couple in the world, so their split, however tawdry some of the details, is a news story of giant import&#8212;as much import, say, as the president’s cover-up of an alleged dalliance with a porn actress. Bezos is the founder of a trillion-dollar company that has revolutionized the way we shop and live. In addition to Amazon, of course, he also owns one of America’s most powerful news organizations, which has been at the forefront of shaping our understanding of the current political crisis. Shouldn’t one of America’s great newspapers be able to cover the hand that feeds it?</p>\n<p>Inside <em>The Washington Post</em> newsroom, the story is big news, if not yet entirely news of the printable sort. Various journalists that I’ve spoken with at the organization have suggested that writers and editors are ruminating about how the <em>Post</em> is going to proceed with covering&#8212;or not covering&#8212;the story as it continues to shake out. Reporting on one’s owner or parent company is always a thorny affair. Some outlets, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/12/10/michael-bloomberg-still-doesnt-seem-understand-how-journalism-works/?utm_term=.ddb08324010a\">like Bloomberg</a>, just don’t do it. (Although even Bloomberg is grappling with what to do if <strong>Mike Bloomberg</strong> decides to run for president.) Others, like <em>The New York Times,</em> have reputations for assiduous introspection. (Several months ago, the <em>Times</em> assigned five reporters to a front-page <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/business/media/james-wolfe-ali-watkins-leaks-reporter.html\">story</a> about a controversy involving one of its own journalists.) The <em>Post</em> is in a particularly tricky spot when it comes to these matters: it has the distinction of being owned by someone who also happens to be the richest person in the world, and therefore one of the world’s most newsworthy people.</p>\n<p>The <em>Post</em> journalists I spoke with, perhaps high-mindedly, acknowledged that tabloid-style extramarital affairs aren’t typically in their wheelhouse. “If Amazon had a Facebook type of situation, which had tentacles in Congress, public documents, some sort of connection with the election, that would be far closer to our center of gravity,” one of them told me. “We probably would not be putting a whole team of reporters on this in any case. But it does raise some questions.”</p>\n<p>At the same time, they don’t want to appear to be ignoring the story. Another <em>Post</em> journalist told me that some reporters and editors are indeed having conversations about how to handle it and what angle would be appropriate. Is there a tech angle? A business story? Something for the Style section? This is, after all, the <em>Post</em>’s first real crucible, in terms of how to approach a big, controversial episode involving the boss. (The paper very admirably covered another recent story about itself, the murder of Global Opinions columnist Jamal Khashoggi, with fortitude and grace.) “There has been some effort to figure out what’s the threshold for us to write about this,” the <em>Post</em> journalist said. “It’s the first test case, and in the most uncomfortable and salacious territory possible. It’s, like, can’t you just give us a good old-fashioned tax evasion?”</p>\n<p>As of Monday afternoon, the <em>Post</em>’s coverage had been scant&#8212;an A.P. feed and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/01/09/jeff-bezos-announces-divorce-mackenzie-bezos-after-years-together/?utm_term=.5c796af91624\">an item</a> in the <em>Post</em>’s “Reliable Source” gossip column reporting on the January 9 news of the divorce itself. To be fair, it wasn’t as if the <em>Post</em>’s main competitors were going wall to wall. The <em>Times,</em> for what it’s worth, ran a “Who Is MacKenzie Bezos?” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/style/jeff-bezos-mackenzie-divorce.html\">feature</a> on the front page of its Monday business section, but beyond that, it hadn’t really done much more than the home team.</p>\n<p>As for reactions to the scandal itself, my casual poll of journalists in different parts of the organization would seem to suggest that there aren’t any fire alarms going off down at One Franklin Square. “This is not an obsession,” one told me. “It doesn&#39;t seem like there is much concern,” said another. I asked a third to rate the feverishness of the watercooler chatter on a scale of 1 to 10. “Probably a 2 or 3,” this person replied. “I’ve had more outside friends ask me about it than I’ve had internal conversations.”</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, newsrooms are hotbeds of gossip, especially when the gossip involves powerful media figures, including a newsroom’s own executives. But Bezos enjoys substantial good will among <em>Post</em> journalists. It was the mogul’s personal fortune that rescued the organization in 2013, his copious investments putting it back on the path to journalistic glory under executive editor <strong>Marty Baron.</strong> And Bezos is generally viewed as a benevolent, hands-off patron who believes in journalism’s crucial function for society. (Perhaps mindful of his <em>Post</em> ownership, Bezos’s attorney <a href=\"https://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-text-messages-affair-scandal/\">told</a> the <em>Enquirer</em> that Bezos “supports journalistic efforts and does not intend to discourage reporting about him.”) Additionally, while Bezos may end up splitting his estimated $137 billion net worth with his soon-to-be ex-wife, it does not appear that the divorce will have any obvious implications for the <em>Post,</em> financial or otherwise.</p>\n<p>What’s more certain is that if the <em>Post</em> does provide any further coverage, it will be closely assessed at the highest levels of the newsroom. “This is something where it really would be Marty’s call,” one of my sources said. “Whatever the <em>Post</em> does, it will absolutely be with his blessing and careful attention.”</p>","rubric":"Media","socialTitle":"“The First Test Case”: The Bezos Divorce Hits the The Washington Post","socialDescription":"The Post journalists I spoke with, perhaps high-mindedly, acknowledged that tabloid-style extramarital affairs aren’t typically in their wheelhouse.

For Amazon, the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive, collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long-term. While polls show that 70% of New Yorkers support our plans and investment, a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project we and many others envisioned in Long Island City.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are disappointed to have reached this conclusion&#8212;we love New York, its incomparable dynamism, people, and culture&#8212;and particularly the community of Long Island City, where we have gotten to know so many optimistic, forward-leaning community leaders, small-business owners, and residents. There are currently over 5,000 Amazon employees in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Staten Island, and we plan to continue growing these teams.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The original deal was met with harsh blowback immediately after it was announced, on account of the fact that, despite the pledge to create new jobs, many people didn’t think the richest company in the world, run by the richest man in the world, needed billions in incentives to move to a city where fellow tech giants like Google have <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/google-to-invest-usd1-billion-in-nyc-no-tax-incentives-needed.html\">come for free</a>. (That Amazon has said it will continue growing its teams in the other boroughs, sans subsidies, suggests it didn’t.) On Twitter, Representative <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1062204614496403457\">wrote</a>: “The idea that [Amazon] will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here.” Last week, State Senator <strong>Michael Gianaris,</strong> a major critic of the deal, was appointed to a state board that had the power to veto the whole thing, at which point Amazon <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/facing-opposition-amazon-reconsiders-ny-headquarters-site-two-officials-say/2019/02/08/451ffc52-2a19-11e9-b011-d8500644dc98_story.html\">reportedly</a> began to reconsider the move.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Gianaris basically told Amazon: <em>don’t let the door hit you on the way out.</em> “Like a petulant child, Amazon insists on getting its way or takes its ball and leaves,” Gianaris told <em>The New York Times.</em> “Even by their own words, Amazon admits they will grow their presence in New York without their promised subsidies. So what was all this really about?” In addition to the subsidies, other perks of the deal that didn’t go over super well with the public included a plan to move a distribution center for school lunches and give Bezos access to a helicopter pad.</p>\n<p>Among those for whom the announcement will 100 percent ruin Valentine’s Day? New York Governor <strong>Andrew Cuomo,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-governor-jokes-amazon-cuomo-name-change-hq2-2018-11\">said</a> last year he would change his name to Amazon Cuomo “if that’s what it takes,” and in recent days <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/new-york-governor-cuomo-says-the-state-needs-amazon.html\">went after politicians</a> opposing the plan, calling their resistance “irresponsible” and “governmental malpractice.” Also: everyone who rushed to buy a place in Queens on the original news. “This is like a gift from the gods for the Long Island City condo market,” <strong>Patrick W. Smith,</strong> a real-estate agent in the area, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-move-to-long-island-city-sparks-condo-frenzy-1542116117\">told</a> <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> at the time. “What happened today is a real tragedy,” <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-14/long-island-city-brokers-despair-over-amazon-s-abrupt-reversal\">said</a> <strong>Jason Haber</strong>, a broker with Warburg Realty Partnership Ltd, on the anniversary of an actual, <a href=\"https://splinternews.com/one-year-later-florida-students-join-together-to-remem-1832629945\">non-real estate tragedy</a>.

So, just a quick update: what he meant to say was that victims of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/14/18222167/trump-border-security-deal\">natural disasters will pay for it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Senate Majority Leader <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> said Thursday that Trump agreed to sign a package of seven spending bills that will fund nine federal departments including Transportation, Agriculture, and Homeland Security, narrowly averting another government shutdown. The president will also declare a national emergency at the same time, McConnell said. . . . By declaring a national emergency, Trump will be able to tap into funds otherwise dedicated to disaster relief or military construction projects, and redirect them to border wall construction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To recap, Trump demanded money for his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/upshot/trump-border-wall-polls.html\">deeply unpopular</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/border-wall-impractical-expensive-ineffective-plan\">completely pointless</a> border wall for more than two years, was denied at every turn, shut down the government, still didn’t get what he wanted, and has now decided, <em>screw it, I’ll just take the money.</em> It’s the sort of thinking that you would expect from guy whose father <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-fred-trump-taxes\">funded</a> one epic disaster after another, though <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/us/politics/trump-national-emergency-border.html\">not everyone is going for it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> of California said Democrats were “reviewing our options” in responding to Mr. Trump’s anticipated declaration and did not rule out a legal challenge. “The president is doing an end run around Congress,” she said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She also raised the possibility that Mr. Trump was setting a precedent for Democratic presidents to come, precisely what Republicans fear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You want to talk about a national emergency, let’s talk about today,” Ms. Pelosi said, reminding Mr. Trump that it was the first anniversary of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. “That’s a national emergency. Why don’t you declare that emergency, Mr. President? I wish you would.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-08/trump-can-t-declare-national-emergency-to-build-border-wall\">noted</a> last month, “any attempt by Trump to get around Congress by using invented emergency powers would violate the Constitution” and would “almost certainly would be blocked by the courts,” not to mention “constitute a high crime and misdemeanor qualifying him for impeachment.” On the other hand, staying on the right side of the law has never been of particular importance to this president. And he wants his wall, god damn it! He’s a builder! He builds things! Just give him the money, and no one gets hurt!</p>\n<p><strong>You’ll never believe it, but Trump’s E.P.A. might have subverted science</strong></p>\n<p>After its takes on methane in the atmosphere (<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/09/trumps-insane-new-energy-policy-would-put-global-warming-on-steroids\">good</a>), fossil fuels (<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-team-advocates-burning-fossil-fuels-even-u-s-scientists-n946826\">good</a>), and asbestos (<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/donald-trump-asbestos\">very very good</a>), this report <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/epas-top-leaders-stymied-research-unit-report-finds-11550149201\">may or may not come as a shock</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An Environmental Protection Agency research unit tasked with evaluating chemicals’ health risks has had its work hindered by the agency’s top leadership, according to a government watchdog. The unit, known as the Integrated Risk Information System, or IRIS, is responsible for identifying dangers from chemicals in products such as paint and pesticides, and releasing assessments of their potential threats to human health.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A draft Government Accountability Office report found that “the IRIS program has been unable to release any work since June 2018 while it was waiting for feedback from the Administrator’s office,” according to a copy reviewed by <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> The G.A.O. is a nonpartisan federal auditing agency that provides information to Congress. “IRIS program progress toward producing assessments was delayed by EPA leadership deliberations about priorities,” the draft said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The findings reflect a fundamental shift in thinking at agencies like the E.P.A., where Trump administration officials are challenging longtime practices, particularly around the use of science, said <strong>Bernard Goldstein,</strong> a professor emeritus at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health who oversaw EPA scientific programs under President Reagan. “They’ve had these standard approaches, and now the standard approaches are gone,” said Mr. Goldstein, adding that he found this development troubling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a statement, E.P.A. spokesman <strong>James Hewitt</strong> claimed Trump-appointed officials at the agency <em>love</em> science, just not the commie kind used under Obama that prioritized protecting human health and the environment. “The Trump EPA believes it is using the best available science to determine its proposed rules and regulations, just as the former administration believed it was doing the same thing,” Hewitt told the <em>Journal.</em> “However, this administration clearly has huge disagreements with the way the Obama administration carried out the agency’s mission.”</p>\n<p><strong>But what about the ethics pledge?!</strong></p>\n<p>Here’s another update you might want to sit down for: it turns out Trump wasn’t actually serious about draining the swamp, unless when he said “drain the swamp” he actually meant “re-populate it with officials from my own administration,” which he might have! Sometimes these things get lost in translation. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-lobbying-swamp-is-flourishing-in-trumps-washington\">Per ProPublica</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In his first 10 days in office, Trump signed an executive order that required all his political hires to sign a pledge. On its face, it’s straightforward and ironclad: When Trump officials leave government employment, they agree not to lobby the agencies they worked in for five years. They also can’t lobby anyone in the White House or political appointees across federal agencies for the duration of the Trump administration. And they can’t perform “lobbying activities,” or things that would help other lobbyists, including setting up meetings or providing background research. Violating the pledge exposes former officials to fines and extended or even permanent bans on lobbying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But loopholes, some of them sizable, abound. At least 33 former Trump officials have found ways around the pledge. The most prominent is former Interior Secretary <strong>Ryan Zinke,</strong> who resigned in December after a series of ethics investigations. He announced Wednesday that he is joining a lobbying firm, Turnberry Solutions, which was started in 2017 by several former Trump campaign aides. Asked whether Zinke will register as a lobbyist, Turnberry partner Jason Osborne said, “He will if he has a client that he wants to lobby for.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ex-lobbyists, of course, also play a major role in the Trump administration, with one of the most prominent being acting E.P.A. administrator <strong>Andrew Wheeler,</strong> who had a bright career as a coal lobbyist before joining Team Trump. According to ProPublica, “at least 230 former and current registered lobbyists have worked in the Trump administration.”</p>\n<p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>New Jersey Governor Says New York’s

major gossip tale of 2019.","body":"<p>Who&#8212;many wondered after news landed Wednesday that <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> and his wife, <strong>MacKenzie,</strong> were divorcing&#8212;will he date now? Who will be the new companion to America’s wealthiest man, a shaper of jobs, titan of industry, and middle-aged space explorer? Our curiosity was apparently sated mere hours later when Page Six reported he’s allegedly been dating <strong>Lauren Sanchez,</strong> a longtime correspondent on Fox’s <em>Good Day L.A.</em> and helicopter-flight consultant for television and film.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, <em><a href=\"https://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-text-messages-affair-scandal/\">The National Enquirer</a></em> followed up, quoting what it claimed were text messages sent by Bezos to Sanchez sometime in April. The alleged messages are fine, though they suggest MacKenzie was really the writer in that marriage. Private messages made public are embarrassing, no matter how boring they are.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/jeff-bezos-divorce-lauren-sanchez-cheating-affair-photos-exclusive/\">teaser article</a> that preceded the main “bombshell,” the tabloid also bragged about stalking the pair from one luxury locale to the next and also Boston during a “four-month investigation.” It claimed it followed Bezos and Sanchez “across five states and 40,000 miles, tailed them in private jets, swanky limos, helicopter rides, romantic hikes, five-star hotel hideaways, intimate dinner dates, and ‘quality time’ in hidden love nests.”</p>\n<p>So! Having now read the alleged receipts, let’s assemble the narrative as the tabloids have presented it. Sanchez and Bezos apparently first met the way most Hollywood characters usually encounter tech barons. In 2016 Bezos <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/jeff-bezos-newly-divorcing-now-seeing-lauren-sanchez-whitesell-1175047\">threw a party</a> for <em>Manchester by the Sea</em> with <strong>Matt Damon,</strong>  and Sanchez was present. He eventually hired Sanchez to take aerial shots in a helicopter for his aerospace company, Blue Origin, according to a <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/01/09/jeff-bezos-has-been-seeing-former-tv-anchor-lauren-sanchez/\">Page Six</a> source. Multiple sources also claimed to the outlet that Sanchez is separated from her husband <strong>Patrick Whitesell,</strong> the co-C.E.O. of Hollywood talent agency W.M.E., and <a href=\"https://people.com/movies/who-is-lauren-sanchez-dating-jeff-bezos/\">an insider</a> claimed to <em>People</em> that the marriage has been “on-and-off” for some time. A lawyer for Bezos told the <em>Enquirer</em> that he and MacKenzie had been “long separated.” It all seems subdued when compared to the usual tabloid exploits of the nation-state rich, and the next-level maturity persists, as Sanchez and Bezos were <a href=\"https://people.com/movies/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-patrick-whitesell-attended-amazon-golden-globes-party/\">even at the same Golden Globes</a> party on Sunday, along with Whitesell.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, effort was seemingly made to tamp down the <em>scandale</em> of it all on Wednesday when Bezos posted a statement calmly announcing the divorce. It reads in part: “As our family and close friends know, after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends.” For the majority of Americans who, unlike the <em>Enquirer,</em> are not close Bezos-watchers, it came out of nowhere.  Part of the shock may be because many folks <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/jeff-bezos-was-married-is-now-divorced-1831606656\">hadn’t internalized the fact that Bezos was married</a>, and now they may have to contend with a new girlfriend? It’s a lot to take in. Many New Yorkers haven’t forgiven the guy for commandeering Long Island City yet. Maybe the conspiracy-minded see this as a distraction, a little dirt-dishing to deflect attention from the rents that have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/22/realestate/what-amazon-means-for-long-island-city.html\">already gone up</a>&#8212;no wonder <a href=\"https://slate.com/business/2018/11/amazons-new-york-hq2-helipad-jeff-bezos.html\">he wanted that helipad</a>.</p>\n<p>Remove all the gossip packaging and the billions hanging in the balance, and a surprisingly pedestrian story writes itself. Namely, they allegedly worked together and were neighbors&#8212;both couples had houses in Seattle, per a Page Six source&#8212;and then they allegedly started dating. (Bezos and Sanchez did not respond to requests for comment by Page Six.) And despite all the stalking and intrigue and the power players involved, the story as it’s been set forth by a tabloid or two with all its holes and unconfirmed details, so far, is a familiar tale of a man seeking a new relationship after a divorce.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Nothing says grace like <a

","familyName":"Cohn","bio":"There was Gary Cohn, whose dyslexia had forced one teacher to confess to his parents that they’d be really lucky if he should grow up to be a truck driver, standing outside the commodities exchange at Four World Trade Center on a Friday afternoon. It was the early 1980s, and Cohn had convinced his boss at an Ohio steel company to let him take a day off from selling window frames so he could visit New York for the first time and land a job on Wall Street. So how did he do it? Like many men who went on to become titans at big banks: he lied.\n<p>Cohn’s story is one of legends, told to inspire incoming interns each summer and even spelled out in a Malcolm Gladwell book. He followed a well-dressed guy shouting about being late to get to LaGuardia into an elevator, and told him he, too, was headed to the airport. He offered to share a cab. Stuck in traffic, he fibbed about how much he knew about options trading (nothing) and a week and a half later, he started working for him. Cohn became known as the “gum guy,” because his job, in part, included holding out sticks of chewing gum to shouting traders who needed to wet their throats. He made enough money to start trading silver soon after, until Goldman Sachs swooped him up in its commodities trading unit in 1990. Cohn has been there ever since.</p>\n<p>As the investment bank’s president and chief operating officer, he is second-in-command to C.E.O. Lloyd Blankfein. And while heavy is the head that wears the crown of one of the most influential investment banks in the world, heavier, perhaps, is the head who’s been waiting decades to wear it himself. As the king-in-wait rests impatiently, as some have suggested, the two have reportedly remained close friends. The Blankfein and Cohn families had long vacationed together, despite them living on opposite poles of Central Park (Cohn to the East, Blankfein to the West).</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/574337324f6c70a31f0516e9_hive-contributor-profile-gary-cohn.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 1:06 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-gary-cohn.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-gary-cohn.jpg","credit":"By Jared Siskin/PatrickMcMullan.com.","_links":{},"id":"5743373255f979a31fa98982","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 1:00 pm","revision":5,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 1:06 pm","description":"PMC","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/gary-cohn","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/574337324f6c70a31f0516e9_hive-contributor-profile-gary-cohn.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 1:06 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-gary-cohn.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-gary-cohn.jpg","credit":"By Jared Siskin/PatrickMcMullan.com.","_links":{},"id":"5743373255f979a31fa98982","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 1:00 pm","revision":5,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 1:06 pm","description":"PMC","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"5736246bff97be4071973d94","revision":2,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/gary-cohn"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"<em>Where’s My Roy Cohn?</em> Digs into One of the 20th Century’s Most Evil Men","promoHed":"<em>Where’s My Roy Cohn?</em> Digs into One of the 20th Century’s Most Evil Men","dek":"The film, which premieres today at the Sundance Film Festival, explores the life and times of Roy Cohn&#8212;and his mentorship of an upstart mogul named Donald Trump.","promoDek":"The film, which premieres today at the Sundance Film Festival, explores the life and times of Roy Cohn&#8212;and his mentorship of an upstart mogul named Donald Trump.","body":"<p>Sometimes, finding a title is the hardest thing about making a film. For <strong>Matt Tyrnauer,</strong> on this occasion, it was the easiest. “Never before has a sitting president delivered a film title for me,” he told me. During the first month of <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> investigation into <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> alleged corruption, in a moment of frustration with the legal and public-relations walls that seemed to be closing in on him, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/trump-sessions-russia-mcgahn.html\">the president blurted something out</a> to his White House advisers: “Where’s <em>my</em> Roy Cohn?!”</p>\n<p>Watching Tyrnauer’s new documentary about Cohn, which premieres in competition at Sundance today, it’s easy to pinpoint what a young Donald Trump was yearning for back in January 2018: a ruthlessness that somehow came off as charming, a toughness punctuated with a wink at supporters and a jab at detractors, a commitment to getting one’s way no matter what. And what did Roy Cohn, the notoriously malicious lawyer most infamous for helping Senator Joseph McCarthy carry out the Red Scare, see in Trump?</p>\n<p>“I think he saw an up-and-comer, a tall, blond, handsome rich kid, to whom he was always attracted as a short and unattractive, albeit brilliant, frustrated person,” explained Tyrnauer. “And he had a long track record of befriending the handsome scions of certain privileged families in the world that he inhabited.”</p>\n<p>For Tyrnauer, a <em>Vanity Fair</em> contributing editor whose previous documentaries include <em>Valentino: The Last Emperor, Studio 54,</em> and <em>Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood,</em> <em>Where’s My Roy Cohn?</em> was born in two parts.</p>\n<p>During the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, as Tyrnauer was reviewing hundreds of hours of archival footage for <em>Studio 54</em> (which premiered at Sundance last year), he found himself face-to-face with Cohn, who had defended Studio 54’s co-founders, <strong>Ian Schrager</strong> and Steve Rubell, after the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/15/archives/irs-raids-studio-54-5-ounces-of-cocaine-seized-studio-54-raided-by.html\">raid on their nightclub</a> in December 1978. “It’s some of the greatest archival footage I&#39;ve ever seen,” Tyrnauer said. “It’s Roy Cohn, [the] pit bull, mob lawyer, just having impromptu press conferences with every news camera in Radio City trained on him, barking at the press, and doing this performance as the lawyer of lawyers.”</p>\n<p>Tyrnauer had known the basics of Cohn’s story: that he had been Senator McCarthy’s right hand in the post-World War II anti-communist Red Scare and the lesser known Lavender Scare, which targeted gays working in the government. He knew that Cohn had actively campaigned to have Ethel and Julius Rosenberg sentenced to death by electric chair based on their conspiracy to commit espionage. Tyrnauer had also seen <em>Angels in America,</em> the <strong>Tony Kushner</strong> play that includes Cohn as a character and incorporates aspects of his death from AIDS, his denial of his own homosexuality, and his overall moral turpitude.</p>\n<p>Tyrnauer knew too that, while Cohn was most famous for his role as Senator McCarthy’s protégé in the 1950s, Cohn also had a protégé of his own: a young, up-and-coming real-estate developer named <strong>Donald J. Trump.</strong> And though Trump and Cohn’s relationship spanned from the early 1970s until a few months before Cohn’s death, in 1986 (Trump abandoned his mentor as Cohn lay dying), there seemed to be a lot of information of contemporary significance contained within their bizarre partnership&#8212;information that in 2016, as Americans braced themselves for the possibility of a President Donald Trump, constituted a story that seemed imperative to Tyrnauer. After all, the director was watching, clear as day, behavior he had once singularly attributed to Trump&#8212;the public bullying, the condemnation of the press, the clunky attempts at manipulation sealed with a smirk, the refusal to back down&#8212;being performed by Roy Cohn, albeit in archival footage.</p>\n<p>“It was in the back of my mind all of that election year that Donald Trump and Roy Cohn had a deep connection and that that was interesting. But also, <em>thank God Trump could never win,</em> because this will all be behind us and we will never have to think about Donald Trump and Roy Cohn again,” said Tyrnauer. “And of course, I was wrong. So when the horrifying result was finally known, I thought, knowing there was extensive film and video record of Cohn <em>and</em> knowing he was the ‘creator’ of Donald Trump, I believed&#8212;and still believe&#8212;this was the only film worth making in 2017, for me, at least.”</p>\n<p>He wrote the treatment for the documentary on November 8, 2016. Soon after, he began conducting interviews with Cohn’s family members and friends, such as Trump’s recently indicted associate <strong>Roger Stone</strong>&#8212;who comes off as thoughtful and nostalgic in the film&#8212;as well as journalists who knew Cohn (including <strong>Marie Brenner,</strong> a <em>Vanity Fair</em> writer-at-large who produced the film and wrote a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/donald-trump-roy-cohn-relationship\">profile of Cohn</a> in 2017).</p>\n<p>The silver bullet, however, was a deal Tyrnauer made that granted him exclusive access to Cohn’s personal archive of never-before-seen photos and videos. (As part of the deal, Tyrnauer is forbidden to say how they came into his possession.) The images from Cohn’s private collection are deployed poetically by the filmmakers. Photographs of Cohn at splashy parties, surrounded by attractive young men, sweep across the screen while we hear never-before-heard audio from a tense interview by the writer <strong>Ken Auletta.</strong> Responding to a question about his sexuality, Cohn says: “Anybody who knows me, or knows anything about me, or who knows the way my mind works, would have an awfully hard time reconciling that with any kind of homosexuality. In other words, every facet of my personality, my aggressiveness, my toughness . . . is just totally incompatible with anything like that.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5c4b50b240f948733f000011.js?autoplay=0\"></div></div><p>The interview, which was conducted as a part of Auletta’s reporting for his <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a46616/dont-mess-with-roy-cohn/\">1978 <em>Esquire</em> cover story on Cohn</a>, is interspersed with contemporary commentary from Auletta, in which he says Cohn “squirmed, which gave me a great amount of pleasure because, in a way, I was doing to him . . . what he had done to people in [the] McCarthy hearings.”</p>\n<p>“That gave me enormous satisfaction, to have the audiotape of Cohn giving his very hypocritical, and lying, defense of his non-homosexuality, overlaid onto his own private photographs of himself in the company of what appeared to be attractive younger men,” said Tyrnauer. “There’s a searing irony, tragedy, and bitter feeling evoked by that, in my opinion.”</p>\n<p>These takes can be hard to parse. Is Cohn’s public outing of gay men and women justification for the public outing of Cohn? In both cases, shouldn’t an individual be able to decide if they want to publicly acknowledge their sexuality? What about their medical diagnoses? Tyrnauer’s documentary isn’t afraid to play with these questions. An interview with one of Cohn’s cousins sums up the feelings of many: “If he had come out and said, ‘Look, I’m a homosexual. I have AIDS. We need to do something, not just for me, but for the community,’ he would have been a hero. But instead, he was a hypocrite.”</p>\n<p>All in all, <em>Where’s My Roy Cohn?</em> is the result of a painstaking commitment to stitching together a comprehensive portrait of a man many have considered to be evil incarnate. It’s a film that, at times&#8212;and despite all odds&#8212;will invoke in viewers genuine sympathy for its subject.</p>\n<p>The documentary also features a never-before-aired NBC News interview with Cohn from the 70s. Talking with <strong>Linda Ellerbee</strong> (whom millennial readers may recognize from her 1990s Nickelodeon news program), Cohn holds up a framed diptych of a portrait of himself with Donald Trump, alongside a letter from Trump. “Cohn waxes almost sexually about the beauty of their friendship,” explained Tyrnauer. “And brags that Donald writes to him that Roy is his best friend. And then, in this kind of giddy, almost excited voice, reads the letter.” (The letter itself, which is legible in the footage, does not actually describe Cohn as Trump’s great friend&#8212;ironic proof, perhaps, that Trump and Cohn truly were birds of a feather.)</p>\n<p>Moments later, Nostradamus-like, Cohn says “Donald Trump is probably one of the most important names in America today. What started off as a meteor mounting from New York and going upward is going to touch the rest of this country and parts of the world. Donald just wants to be the biggest winner of all.”</p>\n<p>It’s one of many historic moments throughout the film that shed light on our contemporary predicament. The documentary shows how Trump and Cohn first came together in the years-long run-up to the opening of Trump Tower, in 1983. Trump, in an effort to cut costs, hired a Syracuse-based window-washing company to tear down the historic Bonwit Teller building (destroying invaluable Art Deco reliefs in the process) with a crew of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/nyregion/trump-tower-illegal-immigrant-workers-union-settlement.html\">200 undocumented Polish immigrants</a>, who were forced to strip live wire barehanded. Some were never paid. At Cohn’s suggestion, Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/opinions/are-trumps-mob-connections-a-coincidence-fuhgeddaboudit/2018/08/10/24b62e2c-9cad-11e8-843b-36e177f3081c_story.html\">hired S&amp;A Concrete</a>, a mob front, to pour the building’s foundation. Trump survived this and other P.R. explosions by scrupulously adhering to the Roy Cohn code: Never back down. Never apologize. Never admit defeat.</p>\n<p>More than a month into the federal government shutdown, while millions of streaming-service subscribers debate <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/which-fyre-festival-documentary-to-watch-netflix-hulu\">which Fyre Festival documentary to watch first</a>&#8212;and on a day which began with <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/25/politics/roger-stone-arrested/index.html\">Roger Stone’s arrest</a> in an early-morning F.B.I. raid&#8212;Cohn and Trump’s commitment to sociopathic manipulation feels oddly all-American. As the first-wave feminist <strong>Anne Roiphe</strong> puts it: “Roy was an evil produced by certain parts of the American culture. There always is the possibility of another person who cares not about our traditions or our laws or our protections, who can come in and wreck it for the weakest among us and the most vulnerable.”</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Contradiction and hypocrisy are twin themes throughout <em>Where’s My Roy Cohn?,</em> from Cohn’s choices in décor (a Mickey Mouse-themed “Roy” sign on his bedroom door and a mirror above the bed) to the fact that Cohn persecuted government employees for being homosexual while he, himself, was gay. Which leads us to the burning question viewers will be left to answer for themselves upon conclusion of viewing <em>Where’s My Roy Cohn?</em></p>\n<p>How is it possible that all of these powerful people&#8212;such as Ronald Reagan, who, despite his refusal to acknowledge the AIDS epidemic, actually helped Roy Cohn get admitted to the National Institute of Health for an experimental AIDS treatment&#8212;were willing to contradict their own deeply held beliefs and morals by befriending Roy Cohn? Cohn’s one-time boyfriend <strong>Wallace Adams</strong> explains in the documentary how he would attend parties full of anti-gay Republicans as Roy’s companion, and how no one would say a word about it.</p>\n<p>“He was a master ingratiater, and manipulator, and he understood the power dynamics and power politics of the United States,” Tyrnauer explained of Cohn. “He was a string puller, and a demigod whisperer, the likes of which we rarely saw before and probably haven’t seen since.”</p>\n<p>What about Andy Warhol and Norman Mailer and <strong>Barbara Walters,</strong> the latter of whom was one of Cohn’s dearest friends (so close, in fact, that he would tell people that they planned to marry someday)? How did the liberal elite befriend such a right-wing firebrand? What about the mayors, the police commissioners, the Cardinals, and the other elites of New York society?</p>\n<p>Tyrnauer answered that question with a question of his own:</p>\n<p>“Have you <em>met</em> New York society?”</p>","rubric":"Society","socialTitle":"Where’s My Roy Cohn?

Among the many changes it’s reportedly making this year is the decision to switch up how best-actor trophies are presented. For the last several years, acting categories have been presented by the performer who won in that category the last year. But <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/02/oscars-lady-gaga-push-academy-fix-song-snafu-gary-oldman-frances-mcdormand-sam-rockwell-allison-janney-no-presenting-1202547403/\">according to Deadline</a>, the Academy has yet to reach out to last year’s winners <strong>Gary Oldman,</strong> <strong>Frances McDormand,</strong> <strong>Sam Rockwell</strong> (nominated this time for <em>Vice</em>), and <strong>Allison Janney.</strong> Why? Because the organization is reportedly looking for bigger stars to present these categories, as a way to potentially juice ratings.</p>\n<p>Representatives for the Academy have not yet responded to <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s request for comment about this report. As Deadline suggests, the Academy might opt to tap folks like, say, <strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong> or <strong>Tom Hanks</strong> to present the categories as a way to kick the show’s Q score up a few points. It’s not enough to just <em>be</em> the Oscars anymore; with ratings <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-oscars-eye-new-low-early-numbers-1091636\">dwindling</a> year by year, the Academy is desperate to spice up the ceremony.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the telecast, many of its attempts to shake things up have been met with backlash. First, there was the announcement (and quick withdrawal) of the best-popular-film Oscar category. Then, there was the Oscar host debacle, with <strong>Kevin Hart</strong> stepping down after initially refusing to apologize for old homophobic jokes (he later apologized on Twitter, only after announcing that he would not host the show after all). The Academy has since shifted gears by leaning into being hostless, and is now focusing on getting interesting batches of stars together to present the various categories.</p>\n<p>Not having a host should save the show some precious airtime, another Academy concern. When the best-popular-film category was initially announced, the Academy also revealed that this year’s show would run a tight three hours, a goal it would achieve by rewarding certain categories (such as, reportedly, best cinematography) during commercial breaks. Though it was overshadowed by the best-popular-film scrum at first, that decision has also been criticized as demoralizing and devaluing to the winners who will no longer have their moments included in the broader telecast. “As a member of @TheAcademy I’m offended by the proposed changes to the telecast,” filmmaker and Academy member <strong>Gina Prince-Bythewood</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GPBmadeit/status/1089575792961454080\">tweeted</a>. “Filmmaking is a collection of crafts and The Academy is the only awards show that honors and amplifies all. As it should be.”</p>\n<p>It’s unclear if the Academy will switch gears now that the film world is reacting negatively to these proposed changes. However, it has already reneged on one major planned shift. Previously, the Academy announced that only two best-original-song nominees would be performed at the ceremony: just <strong>Lady Gaga</strong> (“Shallow”) and <strong>Kendrick Lamar</strong> and <strong>SZA</strong> (“All the Stars”) would appear on the telecast, leaving out three fellow nominees from the films <em>RBG,</em> <em>Mary Poppins Returns,</em> and <em>The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.</em> The decision was criticized on social media, including by <em>Mary Poppins Returns</em> star <strong>Lin-Manuel Miranda</strong> who called the choice “truly disappointing” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/1088814437077798913\">in a tweet</a>.</p>\n<p>“Hostless AND music-less?” he added. “To quote Kendrick: Damn.”</p>\n<p>The Academy has since backtracked, announcing this week that all five nominated songs will be performed after all (albeit in a truncated form). It was reported by Deadline that team Gaga actually had to get involved for this rewind to happen, with the star telling the Academy that she wouldn’t perform period if all five songs weren’t recognized by the telecast.

But some big-time Wall Street Democrats are cool with it. (They’ll worry about that 70 percent marginal tax rate later.)","body":"<p>It’s taken less than a month for <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,</strong> the youngest member of the 116th Congress, to use her social media-powered bully pulpit to kick up a veritable policy shitstorm in the swamp. Ocasio-Cortez’s so-called Green New Deal, a vague set of progressive policy goals re-orienting the economy around environmental issues, has quickly become a staple of the national conversation&#8212;a magnet for champions and haters, alike&#8212;even before its legislative details have been fully articulated. (As Axios reported this morning, some policy clues might emerge next week.) <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> and <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> appear to be supportive of the idea. <strong>Michael Bloomberg</strong> called it “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/bloomberg-blasts-pie-sky-green-new-deal-rips-warren-wealth-n964056\">pie in the sky</a>.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, A.O.C.’s other quixotic ideas have become an unavoidable topic for 2020 hopefuls and ornery plutocrats alike. In Davos, the computer billionaire <strong>Michael Dell</strong> <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/domestic-taxes/426695-dell-ceo-rejects-ocasio-cortezs-tax-plan-at-davos\">took issue</a> with another controversial A.O.C. policy idea&#8212;the notion of raising to 70 percent the marginal tax rate for anyone earning more than $10 million per year. “I don’t think it will help the growth of the U.S. economy,” Dell said, aggrieved. “Name a country where that’s worked.” <strong>Gary Cohn,</strong> the former No. 2 at Goldman Sachs and President <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> first national economic adviser, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/30/cnbc-exclusive-cnbc-transcript-former-national-economic-council-director-gary-cohn-speaks-with-cnbcs-leslie-picker-today.html\">concurred</a> on CNBC. Raising taxes on the mega-rich, he said, “would be harmful to the economy.”</p>\n<p>For the Democrats, A.O.C. has quickly become a player. Sure, she can say things that are under-informed and appear sophomoric&#8212;for instance her recent suggestion that “every billionaire,” including ostensible presidential hopeful <strong>Howard Schultz,</strong> represented “a policy failure” within capitalism. (“It’s so un-American to think that way,” Schultz told <strong>Andrew Ross Sorkin,</strong> before recounting how he grew up in the housing projects of Brooklyn and became a self-made man. “I’m living proof of the American dream and aspiration.”) But, given her umbilical connection to a growing progressive base, it’s also hard to imagine a viable 2020 contender ignoring her.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more surprising, however, the arrival of the freshman congresswoman has been generally welcomed by the big-money Wall Street Democrats whose behind-the-scenes maneuvering will help fund the party’s nominee candidate in 2020. In fact, Ocasio-Cortez is getting a modicum of support from the donor class not only for her tax proposals but also for her rapid contributions to the policy debate generally. “I think she’s great,” said <strong>Tom Nides,</strong> a former deputy secretary of state under <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> and current Wall Street executive. “Do I agree with everything that she says? We can debate that. But I think anything that energizes Democrats and gets people to think in a different way and gets Democrats to think about how to use social media as an effective tool, it’s great for Democrats, and it gets the base enthusiastic. I think it’s positive.” Nides doesn’t care that A.O.C. has been in Congress less than a month, or that she was a bartender just months before then or that she is only 29 years old. “I don’t see why people shouldn’t embrace her and feel good about her enthusiasm and the energy she brings,” Nides continued. “It’s only good for Democrats, right? We’ll deal with the differences in policy and all that later, but more enthusiasm is better than less enthusiasm, and I think it’s great.”</p>\n<p>Another senior Wall Street executive and Democratic Party macher told me that while he hadn’t met A.O.C. yet, he is excited by her passion. “I love that she’s willing to go places where a lot of other people aren’t,” he said. While he said he appreciates her contribution to the debate over tax policy and applauds her for introducing the topic on national television and to her 2.7 million Twitter followers, he hopes that she would consider broadening out her thinking to include a discussion of the efficacy of “trickle-down economics.” (“Tax reform is not trickling down,” he said.)</p>\n<p>This executive admitted that he was unsure about what the proper top tax rate is to insure the U.S. Treasury captures a fair and equitable amount from American citizens while also being careful not to quash incentives, but he is glad A.O.C. is stimulating the conversation. “I look at things more mathematically,” he said, “about where should the right tax rate be, and how we should look at tax reform and how we should look at fiscal discipline. But if we were talking generically, I don’t have an issue having a real debate that trickle-down economics, which worked in the 1980s, no longer works.”</p>\n<p>Like Nides, this executive said he does not agree with everything A.O.C. is talking about, in part because “I’m more of a capitalist” than she is, but he too appreciates “her passion” and the “debate” she’s forcing people to have. “I don’t take it as such a turnoff that people are debating where the marginal tax rate should be and whether trickle-down’s working, or whether we should have a green-energy plan,” he continued. “She has a voice . . . when you have 2-plus million Twitter followers, you have a voice, and she’s using it. A lot of the things she’s talking about, I may either not agree or I may say it differently or I may agree, but it definitely leads to conversation.”</p>\n<p>He does not put her in the same knee-jerk anti-banker category as, say, Elizabeth Warren or <strong>Bernie Sanders.</strong> He sees A.O.C. as more enlightened. “A.O.C.’s talking about a lot of what she’s hearing from the people that live in her community and how she views fairness and how she views it,” he said. ”I don’t have an issue, her bringing that to the forefront. That’s the good thing about debating. But there’s a whole different aspect of her bringing things to the forefront and then what becomes law.”</p>\n<p>Nides agreed that it is the conversation, however nascent, that is essential at this point. “I’ve been involved in both winning and losing presidential campaigns,” he said. “You want to have more enthusiasm, not less enthusiasm.

Want more government spending? A higher minimum wage? National health care? Venezuela did all that, and more, and it’s become an economic basket case&#8212;or <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/opinion/venezuela-maduro-socialism-government.html\">so the theory goes</a>. It’s a reductive argument&#8212;Venezuela’s national wealth is also tied to the price of oil, which has collapsed in recent years&#8212;but it’s a seductive analogy, especially for the president. “The new Democrats are radical socialists who want to model America’s economy after Venezuela,” <strong>Donald Trump</strong> <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/10/10/donald-trump-democrats-open-borders-medicare-all-single-payer-column/1560533002/\">wrote</a> in an op-ed last year. He went on to accuse <strong>Andrew Gillum</strong> of seeking to turn Florida into “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1054187956024590336\">the next Venezuela</a>,” and swore that <strong>Beto O’Rourke</strong> would “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1053338516501889025\">never be allowed to turn Texas into Venezuela</a>” either. More recently, the president’s son, <strong>Donald Trump Jr.,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/12/07/its-funny-cuz-its-true-donald-trump-jr-trolls-ocasio-cortez-with-meme-implying-socialists-eat-dogs/\">trolled <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</strong></a> with a meme suggesting that Americans would starve under Venezuela-style socialism, forcing them to eat dogs for sustenance.</p>\n<p>The punch line has become more serious in recent days, as Venezuela’s political system has begun to buckle with a little help from the Trump administration. Last week, the United States officially recognized <a href=\"https://hotair.com/archives/2019/01/27/juan-guaido-isnt-far-right-u-s-stay-venezuela/\">socialist-lite</a> opposition leader <strong>Juan Guaidó</strong> as the legitimate president of Venezuela, and called for current president, <strong>Nicolás Maduro,</strong> to step down. It’s not <em>officially</em> a coup&#8212;at least not yet. “This is not a U.S.-sponsored anything,” Sen. <strong>Marco Rubio,</strong> one of Maduro’s harshest critics in the States, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/01/28/trumps-venezuela-gambit-stirs-debate-over-regime-change/\">said last weekend</a>. “This is the U.S. supporting the people of Venezuela, who want their constitution and democracy followed.” But it is the sort of Truman Doctrine flexing that led the U.S. to topple several South American regimes in the past.</p>\n<p>Trump’s personal fixation on Venezuela is notable, given that he professes to be such an ardent anti-interventionist. For years, he has been among the most vocal voices of dissent in the G.O.P. calling for troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and Syria. But there’s <em>something</em> about Hispanic, socialist Venezuela&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/opinion/venezuela-maduro-socialism-government.html\">the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of countries</a>&#8212;that makes Trump lust for a “military option.”</p>\n<p>On Sunday, Sen. <strong>Lindsey Graham,</strong> a notorious neoconservative hawk, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-foreign-policy-venezuela-lindsey-graham-89c8c3ff-c9f2-4924-9162-b10acd7e0185.html\">told Axios’s <strong>Jonathan Swan</strong></a> that Trump asked him during the height of the government shutdown if the U.S. should simply invade Venezuela.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Graham, recalling his conversation with Trump, said: “He [Trump] said, ‘What do you think about using military force?’ and I said, ‘Well, you need to go slow on that, that could be problematic.’ And he said, ‘Well, I’m surprised&#8212;you want to invade everybody.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Graham laughed. “And I said, ‘I don’t want to invade everybody; I only want to use the military when our national-security interests are threatened.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>”Trump’s really hawkish” on Venezuela, the hawkish Graham added in a phone interview on Sunday afternoon, adding that Trump was even more hawkish than he was on Venezuela.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s not the first time Trump has mused aloud about a military intervention, often unbidden, to topple Maduro. Over the past two years, a revolving door of moderate Trump advisers&#8212;<strong>Rex Tillerson, James Mattis, H.R. McMaster, Gary Cohn</strong>&#8212;have reportedly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/6/17536908/trump-venezuela-invade-military\">talked Trump down</a> from invading Venezuela, though he has continued to push the idea. According to the Associated Press, Trump has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/a3309c4990ac4581834d4a654f7746ef\">raised the issue in private conversations with Latin American leaders</a>, despite being advised not to ask. Those leaders reportedly balked, but the idea has slowly gained traction among Venezuela’s opposition as the situation there has deteriorated. At the same time, political conditions inside the White House began to change. Tillerson, Mattis, McMaster, and Cohn are all gone, replaced by hawks like National Security Adviser <strong>John Bolton,</strong> who recently named Venezuela as one-third of a “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/troika-of-tyranny-is-now-a-wolf-pack-of-rogue-states\">troika of tyranny</a>,” and notorious <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/25/elliott-abrams-envoy-venezuela-1128562\">neocon</a> <strong>Elliott Abrams.</strong> On Fox News, the specter of <em>socialist</em> Venezuela has dominated headlines. The feedback loop between <strong>Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham,</strong> and Trump has whipped all parties into a frenzy. The prospect of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-pompeo-praise-brazil-new-president-jair-bolsonaro-2019-1\">teaming up</a> with right-wing Brazilian President <strong>Jair Bolsonaro</strong>&#8212;the “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-45746013\">Trump of the Tropics”</a>&#8212;to help make an example of the far left is even sweeter.</p>\n<p>Would Trump invade Venezuela to “own the libs”? It’s hard to imagine another bout of military adventurism would be well received by most, but Trump&#8212;whose acting chief of staff says a military option is <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/27/mulvaney-military-action-venezuela-trump-1128613\">not “off the table”</a>&#8212;may be tempted as Democrats curtail his power at home. As Trump faces a newly empowered Democratic party&#8212;strong-arming him in Congress over the government shutdown, launching investigations into his businesses, and, most important, gearing up to run against him in 2020&#8212;regime change in Venezuela would scratch his itch to exercise unilateral executive power and provide a potent (if bloody) talking point. “It is far more important to shut down the Maduro government than our government, and I think Donald Trump is leading there&#8212;and he is winning there,” conservative radio host <strong>Hugh Hewitt</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1089650383075622913\">said</a> Sunday on <em>Meet the Press,</em> encouraging the president to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wag_the_Dog\">wag the dog</a>. “That’s gonna happen. That’s gonna bring us together.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The family drama surrounding <a

Trump</strong> has raged against Democrats for subjecting him to congressional oversight&#8212;cruel and unusual treatment that he never once experienced during his first two years in office, when the House and Senate were controlled by Republicans who probably would have let him stash a body in their basements if it came to it. “An economic miracle is taking place in the United States&#8212;and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations,“ he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/05/politics/donald-trump-state-of-the-union-2019-transcript/index.html\">insisted</a>, bizarrely, during Tuesday night’s State of the Union. “Congressman <strong>Adam Schiff</strong> . . . is going to be looking at every aspect of my life, both financial and personal, even though there is no reason to be doing so,” he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1093467800964866048\">ranted</a> Thursday morning, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1093471134845190145\">adding</a>, like a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1093489029780332545\">feral pigeon</a>, “Never happened before! A continuation of Witch Hunt! PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT! It should never be allowed to happen again!”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Trump, investigating whether or not the president of the United States is under the thumb of foreign governments or other individuals <em>is</em> a thing that is allowed, and Schiff and Co. do not appear to be intimidated by tweets, even in all caps. On Wednesday night, Representative <strong>Eric Swalwell,</strong> who serves on the House Intelligence Committee with Schiff, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-am-1ddb5186-b30e-4d07-81d2-af79a70386f8.html\">told</a> Axios, “We are going to take an M.R.I. to any Russian financing that the Trump Organization and the president may have had,” adding, “We are not going to be so naïve to assume that he’s faithful to the Russians. There may have been other countries who have tried to financially influence him.” And in <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-07/trump-fears-schiff-recruiting-white-house-employees-for-probe\">a sign</a> that Schiff’s full-body cavity search will be deep and wide-reaching:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Schiff has hired one former career official at the National Security Council, <strong>Abigail Grace,</strong> who left the White House last year. She has a congressional e-mail address and is listed in a directory as working for the Intelligence Committee’s Democratic majority. A second career employee detailed to the Trump White House is also considering joining Schiff’s staff, according to people familiar with the matter. They didn’t identify the person.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Grace didn’t respond to an e-mail requesting comment, and her duties under Schiff aren’t known. But the California Democrat’s attempts to hire people with experience working under Trump have led to speculation among Trump’s aides and allies that Schiff is looking for insider knowledge of the White House as he probes whether the business dealings of the president and his family have made them vulnerable to espionage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An official associated with the House panel told Bloomberg it was “appropriate” for the committee “to seek people with prior National Security Council experience for agency oversight,” and that none were “hired directly from the White House.” That’s apparently of little comfort to Trump, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1093471134845190145\">claimed</a> Thursday that Schiff has been “stealing people who work at [the] White House!” and appears to be extremely worried about what’s coming next&#8212;which, to be fair, he probably should be!</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>White House economic adviser: no idea if we’ll get a trade deal with China before make or break deadline</strong></p>\n<p>Back <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/trump-admits-his-incredible-deal-with-china-is-bullshit\">in December</a>, in an effort to soothe jittery markets put on edge by his ongoing, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/trump-declares-trade-wars-are-good\">not-so-easy-to-win</a> trade war with China, Donald Trump announced that he’d struck an “incredible” deal with president <strong>Xi Jinping.</strong> This was a lie, and it was debunked almost immediately. Instead, the two leaders had merely agreed to a temporary 90-day truce in their dispute that will expire on March 1. After that, the Trump administration has vowed to apply additional tariffs to Chinese goods, levies that will be paid for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-who-pays-for-tariffs-trade-war-costs-2019-1\">by U.S. companies and consumers</a>, a prospect that is looking <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/07/stock-market-us-stocks-focus-on-earnings-and-trade-war.html\">more and more likely</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would not meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before the March 2 deadline to reach a Chinese-U.S. trade deal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Trump’s remarks came hours after CNBC reported, citing a senior administration official, that it was “highly unlikely” for the meeting to happen in the coming weeks. While Trump and Xi are still expected to meet eventually, there’s too much work to do to flesh out a deal with China and prepare Trump for a high-stakes meeting with North Korea’s <strong>Kim Jong Un</strong> . . . Trump and Xi may still meet “shortly after” March 2, said the official, who requested anonymity, citing a lack of authorization to speak publicly about the talks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Bloomberg, companies are <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-07/ceos-scramble-to-avoid-trump-s-tariffs-to-survive-his-trade-war\">making contingency plans</a> in the event they can’t count on a capricious toddler to strike a deal, including moving production out of the U.S., which was presumably not part of the White House’s plan when it launched the trade war that got <strong>Gary Cohn</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/gary-cohn-resignation\">to say <em>screw this</em> and quit</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Paul Shekoski’s</strong> company relies on imports of weather-monitoring devices it has made in China. But last year, it paid more in duties than it made in profit because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Now he’s examining every legal option to avoid the duties&#8212;including relocating his production to Mexico.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It has the potential of putting us out of business if we don’t do anything,’’ Shekoski, chief executive of the Wisconsin-based Primex Family of Companies, said by phone from Hong Kong, where he was investigating potential changes to his Chinese supply chain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Asked about the likelihood of a trade deal before the deadline expires, National Economic Council adviser <strong>Larry Kudlow</strong> told reporters: “Will they bring home the bacon? I don’t know.”</p>\n<p><strong>Economists: another Trump-induced shutdown could really screw the economy</strong></p>\n<p>On February 15, temporary funding for government agencies shut down by Trump’s wall demands will expire, unless a bipartisan House-Senate panel is able to strike a deal. House Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/07/pelosi-trump-government-shutdown-1154355\">said</a> Wednesday she’s confident “there will not be another shutdown,” but, as always, the wild card is the man-boy in chief, who no one thought was actually going to shut down the government the first time around. And if he does go 2-for-2, this time will <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/most-economists-say-fresh-government-shutdown-would-hurt-u-s-growth-11549551601\">even worse than round one</a>;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Economists say a fresh government shutdown would take a toll on U.S. economic growth as well as business and consumer sentiment, as a deadline to reach a deal over border-wall funding approaches next week.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most of the private-sector economic forecasters, 58.9 percent, surveyed in recent days by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> said another shutdown would have “somewhat” of an impact on economic growth, while 16.1 percent said it would have a significant impact. The impact on confidence “would be much bigger than direct impact of government spending and services,” said economist <strong>Robert Fry</strong> of Robert Fry Economics LLC.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“A second shutdown would severely erode consumer and business confidence,” <strong>Thomas Kevin Swift,</strong> chief economist at the American Chemistry Council, told <em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> a data point that may or may not concern the president, who said during the first shutdown that he was willing to keep the government closed for years if that’s what it took to get his wall.</p>\n<p><strong>Someone at the State Department is a really big fan of Bob Dylan</strong></p>\n<p>Like, <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/04/why-did-the-state-department-just-spend-84375-dollars-on-bob-dylan-sculpture-art-in-embassies-diplomacy-knockin-on-heavens-door/\">really big</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the middle of what would become the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, the State Department processed an unusual expense: a piece of iron artwork that stands about 4 feet high. The cost? $84,375. The artist? The American singer-songwriter <strong>Bob Dylan.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sculpture, paid for with federal funding not subject to the shutdown, raises questions about how and where the State Department spends money at a time when the Trump administration is pushing to slash funds for American diplomacy and trying to curb overall federal government spending.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a statement, a spokeswoman for the State Department told <em>Foreign Policy</em> that art purchases are made after extensive research and assurances the agency is getting a great deal, “all of it with the taxpayer in mind.”</p>\n<p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>“I Am Disgusted”: Behind the Scenes of Trump’s $107 Million Inauguration (<a

running for president, from one billionaire to another.","body":"<p>In an interview with <em>The New York Times</em> published on Sunday, <strong>Howard Schultz</strong>, who unleashed Pumpkin Spice Lattes on the masses, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/howard-schultz-president-2020.html\">confirmed</a> what many have long suspected: he firmly believes the 2020 presidential race could use another billionaire candidate who hasn’t so much as served as a congressional intern, and he’s <em>this close</em> to announcing that he is that very billionaire, having “already begun the groundwork required to be on the ballot in all 50 states” as an independent. (Schultz will reportedly spend the next three months traveling the country&#8212;perhaps, say, to Iowa&#8212;before making an official announcement.) Unsurprisingly, the news raised the hackles of fellow billionaire <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> who took time out of his busy day of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089883338758914048\">attacking</a> the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089691564283183105\">media</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089876055224184833\">arguing against the separation of church and state</a> to claim that Schultz has neither the brains nor the balls to run for office:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089881244312178688\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089881244312178688\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089881244312178688</a></p></blockquote></div><p>But Trump wasn’t the only member of the three-comma club to come out against Schultz’s (kind-of) candidacy. On Monday afternoon, <strong>Mike Bloomberg</strong> issued a statement on his Web site saying that <a href=\"https://www.mikebloomberg.com/news/mike-bloomberg-statement-independent-run/\">the notion of running as an independent is a horrible idea</a>, and one that will almost certainly put Trump back in the White House for a second term. “I have never been a partisan guy,” the former New York City mayor wrote, “and it’s no secret that I looked at an independent bid in the past. In fact, I faced exactly the same decision now facing others who are considering it. The data was very clear and very consistent. Given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there is no way an independent can win. That is truer today than ever before. In 2020, the great likelihood is that an independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the president. That’s a risk I refused to run in 2016 and we can’t afford to run it now.”</p>\n<p>To some, the idea of Bloomberg warning Schultz off an independent bid is the height of rich, even if he’s clearly 100 percent right. But as the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/#59bf86d61417\">$48 Billion Dollar Man</a> himself points out, he’s been studying up on how to lose elections for <em>years,</em> and after considering independent runs in 2008, 2012, and 2016, he has the data to say definitively it should never be attempted, particularly when it raises the chances of giving an unhinged lunatic another four years in the White House. That’s not to say Bloomberg has an issue with putting another, richer billionaire in office through the two-party system:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With an estimated net worth of $3.3 billion, Mr. Schultz, 65, is one of several billionaires who had been mentioned as possible presidential contenders. The former hedge-fund titan <strong>Tom Steyer,</strong> who had been eyeing a run, announced this month he would focus his energies on a private effort to impeach Mr. Trump. And Mr. Bloomberg has also been contemplating a presidential run.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s a prospect that has Wall Street licking its lips, even if financiers know, deep down inside, that the idea of President Bloomberg is little more than an extremely niche fantasy. “I’m a socially liberal, fiscally conservative centrist who would love to vote for a rational Democrat and get Trump out of the White House,” an anonymous C.E.O. of one of the nation’s largest banks <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/28/wall-street-2020-economy-taxes-1118065\">told</a> Politico’s <strong>Ben White.</strong> “Personally, I’d love to see Bloomberg run and get the nomination. I’ve just never thought he could get the nomination the way the primary process works.”</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Schultz’s listening-tour is off to a great start</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/alexis_levinson/status/1090039389495939072\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexis_levinson/status/1090039389495939072\">https://twitter.com/alexis_levinson/status/1090039389495939072</a></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Speaking of Wall Street’s hopes and fears for 2020</strong></p>\n<p>It should surprise virtually no one to hear that two words <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-warren-eyes-white-house-big-banks-brace-for-browbeating-11548671401\">are keeping the industry up at night</a>: <strong>Elizabeth Warren:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Warren’s presidential bid will be driven by her populist assault on big banks that helped her rise to prominence during the financial crisis and in her successful 2012 Massachusetts Senate race.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although the economy has recovered and new, stricter regulations remain largely in place, Ms. Warren sees cause for further vigilance, and many on Wall Street dread another round of criticism on an even bigger national stage&#8212;the Democratic presidential primary race.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“She has this sort of applause line that we are all crooks, which is scary that you may hear that for a year and a half,” said a large U.S. bank executive who asked to remain anonymous for fear of a Warren backlash.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Still, at least some on Wall Street understand that a president who might nominate regulators who actually hold the industry accountable or insist on stricter oversight of the people that brought you <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/elizabeth-warren-eviscerates-equifax-for-profiting-off-screw-up\">the Equifax hack</a>, is <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/28/wall-street-2020-economy-taxes-1118065\">preferable</a> to an unpredictable lunatic who drags the country into self-defeating trade wars and shuts the government down because someone forgot to feed him his Big Macs and his blood sugar plummeted.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Among the most hardcore Democrats on Wall Street, the strong desire is to find a candidate&#8212;any candidate&#8212;who can beat Trump, even if that means getting behind someone like Warren who supports policies that bankers hate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Everybody just wants to win,” a senior executive told Politico. “It’s as wide open as I’ve ever seen it. There is no gravitational force that everyone is sort of running towards. Everyone has their candidate. Frankly, if people believed Warren would win, they’d jump on board. And everyone in the top tier not named Bernie Sanders could probably win.”</p>\n<p><strong>Wall Street’s #MeToo takeaway: avoid women women like the plague</strong></p>\n<p>“I now think twice about spending one-on-one time with a young female colleague,” a U.S. finance executive <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/world/europe/metoo-backlash-gender-equality-davos-men.html\">confessed</a> to <em>The New York Times</em> on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, requesting anonymity because the issue is “just too sensitive.” Apparently worried they might accidentally sexually harass someone, “a number of men have [said] that they will avoid going to dinner with a female mentee,” and that they’re “concerned about deploying a woman solo on-site with a male,” <strong>Pat Milligan,</strong> who advises multi-national companies on gender and diversity issues, told reporter <strong>Katrin Bennhold.</strong> Men who don’t know how to behave around women in a way that couldn’t be construed as harassment: the true victims of #MeToo!</p>\n<p><strong>A.O.C. puts big tech on notice</strong></p>\n<p>In a letter co-signed by Representative <strong>Chellie Pingree,</strong> the freshman congresswoman told Facebook, Microsoft, and Google that she was “deeply disappointed” to learn that the companies “were high-level sponsors of a conference this month . . . known as LibertyCon, that included a session denying established science on climate change.” Noting that the corporations have pledged to reduce their carbon footprints and committed to pursuing renewable energy, the lawmakers said that such efforts were undercut by “implicit support of the session organized at LibertyCon.” Likening today’s “coordinated campaign to deny climate change, or to put a positive spin on its effects” as “not unlike that of the tobacco companies which once sought to discredit their product’s link to cancer,” Ocasio-Cortez and Pingree said the tech giants must ensure that such climate-change propaganda “do not reflect the values of your companies going forward,“ whether intentional or otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>What Trump’s shutdown hath wrought</strong></p>\n<p>A day after president and his chief of staff <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-is-already-threatening-a-second-shutdown\">threatened</a> to shut down the government for a second time come February 15, the Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/28/government-shutdown-cost-1123735\">reported</a> that the 35-day temper tantrum cost the U.S. economy roughly $3 billion in lost economic activity that “will not be recouped.” Meanwhile, federal contractors, who will not receive back pay for five weeks of lost wages, will have to wait another month until receiving a full paycheck, because their companies will have to wait to be paid by the government. (“It feels like we are still hostages,” <strong>Janice Morgan,</strong> who also had her insurance cut off during the shutdown, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/it-feels-like-we-are-still-hostages-federal-contractors-who-lost-health-insurance-during-shutdown-remain-in-limbo/2019/01/27/9a1020a2-20c3-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html\">told</a> <em>The Washington Post.</em>) And how ‘bout <a href=\"https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2019/01/26/joshua-tree-national-park-rally-against-shutdown-impact/2689866002/\">those national parks</a>?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The federal government shutdown may be over, but fans of Joshua Tree National Park are still angry and upset about the furlough that kept park rangers off the job. . . . Park gates remained open during the shutdown as vandals cut down several Joshua trees and damaged rocks. Without park maintenance crews for the first three weeks, volunteers stepped up to clean bathrooms and collect trash. <strong>Curt Sauer,</strong> who retired as Joshua Tree National Park superintendent in 2010, praised the work of volunteers and lamented the damage caused to the park from illegal campfires, camping and vehicle travel. “What’s happened to our park in the last 34 days is irreparable for the next 200 to 300 years,” he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Remember Gary Cohn asked C.E.O.s to raise their hands if they were going to spend their tax-cut savings on investments no one did?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/1-5-trillion-tax-cut-had-no-major-impact-business-n963411\">Turns out they weren’t kidding</a>!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Trump administration’s $1.5 trillion tax cut package appeared to have no major impact on businesses’ capital investment or hiring plans, according to a survey released a year after the biggest overhaul of the tax code in more than 30 years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The National Association of Business Economics’ quarterly business conditions poll, published on Monday, found that while some companies reported accelerating investments because of lower corporate taxes, 84 percent of respondents said they had not changed plans. That compares to 81 percent in the previous survey published in October.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“A large majority of respondents, 84 percent, indicate that one year after its passage, the corporate tax reform has not caused their firms to change hiring or investment plans,” said NABE president <strong>Kevin Swift.</strong> As a reminder, the White House’s big argument for the tax bill was that it would lead to an investment boom, with companies showering workers with their billions in tax savings.</p>\n<p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>Treasury Set to Borrow $1 Trillion for a Second Year to Finance the Deficit (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-28/another-year-another-1-trillion-in-new-debt-for-u-s-to-raise\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>Bridgewater, RenTech Make $13 Billion in a Grim Year for Hedge Funds (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-28/bridgewater-rentech-make-13-billion-in-a-grim-hedge-fund-year\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>“Another frustration with manufacturing in Texas: American workers won’t work around the clock.

Can she shed her Trump baggage? “People don’t stay in Hollywood jail forever,” says one entertainment executive.","body":"<p>In early October, shortly after the newly spun-off Fox media company\nannounced her appointment as chief communications officer, Hope Hicks\nflew to Los Angeles and set up shop at the Century City InterContinental\nto meet with her new counterparts, the Hollywood trade press. During her\nyears flacking for Donald Trump, Hicks had developed a reputation among\npolitical reporters as a fair broker of sorts. Her stoic disposition may\nhave belied an assassin-level fealty to her boss, but she was\nnevertheless polite and competent in a milieu otherwise defined by chaos\nand turbulence. Perhaps more importantly, she had juice.</p>\n<p>Over the years, Hicks had become an ever present Trump appendage, a\nsurrogate daughter, de facto whisperer and translator. She was a\nZelig-like character in the White House telenovela&#8212;a witness in the\nMueller probe, a young woman who admitted to Congress that she had told\n“white lies” on behalf of her boss. She was allegedly party to a\ncampaign relationship, a West Wing fling, Cabinet tribalism, and\nremained, indisputably, one of the most influential voices in the\npresident’s ear. She touched everything but had fingerprints on nothing.\nEveryone and no one knew her. E-mails and phone calls typically began\nwith “Off the record.” She was the elusive person familiar with the\nsituation. And she was familiar with just about every situation.</p>\n<p>More than anything, though, Hicks was an enigma. Not yet 30 years old,\nwas she a neophyte or a calculating and ambitious striver who advanced\nher way up the greasy pole by blithely defending Trump’s\nbehavior&#8212;someone who had willingly stood by him during the Billy Bush\ntape, the Muslim ban, and “Lock her up”? Was she attracted to power,\nor simply quite skilled at managing the most powerful person in the\nroom&#8212;at interpreting his whims for everyone else bewildered by the\nbehavior? Was she in that role because, given her obvious beauty, she\nappeared perfectly “cast” for it, in her boss’s parlance? (According\nto Michael Wolff’s <em>Fire and Fury,</em> Trump referred to Hicks as “the best\npiece of tail” that his former aide Corey Lewandowski, the partner in\nthat alleged campaign tryst with Hicks, would “ever have.”) Or was it\nall sexist bullshit, and was she merely the only competent one in this\nviper’s den of a West Wing?</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed/?pub=vf&amp;articleID=hope-and-change\"><iframe height=\"100\" width=\"350\" src=\"https://audm.herokuapp.com/player-embed/?pub=vf&amp;articleID=hope-and-change\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>Everyone had a take, it seemed, but no one knew. Hicks, after all, was\nvirtually unknowable. Keeping her boss’s hours, she woke up at four\no’clock in the morning to answer e-mail and exercise. She could run only\ninside, on a treadmill, because she needed to have her two phones in\nfront of her. (Most of her workouts, according to a person familiar with\nthe routine, consisted of running as fast as she could for three minutes\nat a time before the next call came in.) She arrived at the White House\nat 7:30 for a meeting with whoever was chief of staff, and then spent\nvirtually the entire day within earshot of the president. She declined\nto participate in interviews and turned down offers to pose for\nlegendary photographers.</p>\n<p>Among Hollywood reporters, few knew what to expect when Hicks arrived in\nLos Angeles. Many, naturally, had opinions. “All bets were already\nagainst her, because there was an innate disrespect and dislike for the\nwork she did for Trump,” one Hollywood media executive told me,\nreferring to Hicks’s reported role in crafting the president’s infamous\nresponses to Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer in 2016\nand his foreknowledge of the Stormy Daniels payoff, among other things.\n“She’s the person who lied for him and worked for him, and seemed to\nhave no problem with it, and could sleep at night.”</p>\n<p>But given that newsrooms are really just like high-school cafeterias,\nmany had tapped colleagues in Washington and New York for useful gossip.\nA handful of reporters who met Hicks for coffee told me that they were\ninstructed to anticipate someone kind and hardworking. In these\nconversations, Hicks was clear that the job marked a new start for her.\nShe also told the reporters that they should not assume anything about\nher beliefs based on comments espoused by her previous “principal”&#8212;a\nreference to Trump.</p>\n<p>After these conversations, according to numerous people who met with\nher, Hicks seemed saccharine yet somehow sincere. She was also unlike\nany publicist they had ever seen. In Hollywood, beauty is defined by the\nsort of effortless, invisible cool made possible only by a great deal of\neffort and a whole lot of money. Hicks, a former Ralph Lauren model and\na student of the Trump aesthetic, often arrived in black sunglasses,\nblown-out chestnut hair, and a full face of makeup. “It was four P.M.\nwhen I met her, and it was like an alien landed in the middle of Los\nAngeles,” one reporter told me. “That’s not the L.A. vibe. That\ndoesn’t play out here.”</p>\n<p>A few weeks into her job, Hicks found herself in a little hot water.\nSeveral reporters had gotten a tip that longtime Fox executive Gary\nNewman was being relieved of his duties after tense contract\nnegotiations. Newman had wanted a shorter-term deal that would extend\nonly through the Murdoch family’s sale of 21st Century Fox to Disney&#8212;a\n$70-billion-plus mega-merger whose remaining unsold assets, such as Fox\nNews and Fox Sports, would constitute the new Fox entity for which Hicks\nworked. But Fox wanted Newman to sign on to a longer deal. Several\nreporters asked Hicks about Newman, and she insisted that the rumors\nwere untrue and she would let them know if something were to change.\nThings moved faster than she anticipated, though, and on October 19, Fox\ndistributed a press release saying that Newman was out and Charlie\nCollier, an AMC executive, would become head of entertainment for Fox’s\nbroadcasting division.</p>\n<p>In Washington, Hicks may have been able to pull out an excuse for\nreporters&#8212;the situation was fluid, her principal had changed his mind,\net cetera. But in the world of entertainment reporting&#8212;where\njournalists churn less frequently, develop their own soft power, and\nwork on a timeworn barter system&#8212;some felt as if Hicks may have\ncommitted a legitimate foul. “The journalist-publicist relationship in\nthis town is all about the trust in the exchange of information,” the\nreporter explained. “I’ll sit on a story about A-B-C in the short term\nin exchange for X-Y-Z down the line. It’s all about the long-term gain,\nand I don’t think that she got that.”</p>\n<p>Other reporters moved on. It was a fairly minor issue, they told me,\nthat was probably blown out of proportion because most people didn’t\nwant to like her. But the media executive made clear: “You do not lie.\nNot here. You will be run out of town.”</p>\n<p><strong>In some ways,</strong> Hicks has always been better suited for Hollywood than for\nWashington. Raised comfortably in Greenwich, Connecticut, her parents\nmet while working as aides on Capitol Hill. Her father eventually went\non to flack for a tobacco company and, later, for the National Football\nLeague. (Her grandfather handled the P.R. for Texaco during the 1970s\noil crisis.) In sixth grade, at a neighbor’s suggestion, Hicks and her\nsister, Mary Grace, auditioned for a Ralph Lauren campaign and were\nbooked. She posed for Bruce Weber in a campaign for Naturalizer shoes\nand appeared in an episode of <em>Guiding Light</em> and a Nickelodeon program\nabout golf. She auditioned for a part in a movie alongside Alec Baldwin.\nAt 13, she posed for a cover story in <em>Greenwich Magazine,</em> explaining\nthat “if the acting thing doesn’t work out, I could really see myself\nin politics.”</p>\n<p>Around that time, she filmed an audition tape for a kid’s edition of the\nhit show <em>Weakest Link.</em> (On the tape, she performed an improvised rap,\nand offered her best James Bond imitation.) The tape impressed\nexecutives enough that the studio flew her and her mother out to L.A.\nfor a final audition. They spent the days leading up to the meeting\nbeing very “L.A.”&#8212;visiting the store Julia Roberts got kicked out of\nin <em>Pretty Woman,</em> and shopping on Rodeo. Once she arrived at the\naudition, however, reality set in. She did some quick math: there were\neight podiums on set and 10 kids in the room. “You still have to\naudition,” her mom told her, explaining that not everyone at the studio\nwould get selected for the show.</p>\n<p>Hicks, now known for her sangfroid, panicked; she blew the performance.\nIt became somewhat of a running Hicks-household joke for years. Before\nevery job interview or tryouts for sports teams or auditions, her mom\nwould playfully remind her to not “<em>Weakest Link</em>” when it came time.\nHicks never wanted to feel that way again; it gave her a Trump-like\ndrive to win whenever she was reminded of it.</p>\n<p>At Greenwich High School, she lettered in swimming and, like her father\nand sister before her, went on to become captain of the lacrosse team,\nwhich she led to a state championship. To celebrate her graduation, her\nfamily took out a full page in her yearbook with family photos and\nmodeling shots of her and Mary Grace collaged together and the lyrics to\nthe Lovin’ Spoonful’s “Do You Believe in Magic” typed in little black\nletters. “Hope Charlotte Hicks,” it reads at the top. “To the girl\nwith magic in her heart.”</p>\n<div class=\"callout large\" data-type=\"callout\"><p>“She got about as <em>elegant of an exit</em> as anyone could possibly get,”\nsays one Hicks confidant.</p>\n</div><p>Hicks majored in English literature and started the lacrosse team at\nSouthern Methodist University, in Dallas, but stumbled into a circuitous\npath that would lead her to the White House when she joined her father\nat a tailgate event for Super Bowl XLV, in February 2011, in nearby\nArlington. There she met Matthew Hiltzik, a New York public-relations\nexecutive who had worked with Hillary Clinton and Harvey Weinstein at\nMiramax, among others, and whose firm represented Alec Baldwin at the time.\nHiltzik Strategies also managed Ivanka’s burgeoning clothing brand.\nHiltzik would eventually hire Hicks, who was subsequently enlisted to work on\nthe Ivanka account. The two quickly developed a rapport, and Hicks was hired\nat the Trump Organization to handle public relations.</p>\n<p>When Donald Trump announced that he was running for president, Hicks was\n26 and commuting into Manhattan from an apartment she rented with her\nsister in Greenwich. During the campaign, she spent almost a year and a\nhalf living between Trump Force One, as the candidate referred to his\nprivate jet, and a Trump-owned condominium. From the time she woke up,\nat about four o’clock in the morning, until the time she went to bed,\nwhich could be after midnight, her phone vibrated with incoming calls\nand e-mails from reporters, and she answered almost all of\nthem&#8212;because she was the communications staff. After the election, her\nascent to the Trump administration was a certainty. “She’s one of the\npeople who was most candid and most honest with the president, whose\nadvice he valued tremendously,” Ivanka Trump told me. “It’s because\nshe doesn’t opine on issues she hasn’t studied. Any of the roles she’s\nstepped into over the last decade, people would try to argue that she\ndidn’t have qualifications for this or that. But she did so anyway\nbecause she knew her level of intelligence, confidence, work ethic, and\nconviction and ability to jump in. You could literally assign her\nanything and she would be successful.”</p>\n<p>Sure, it was unusual that Hicks had no political experience, but neither\ndid the president and many of his top aides, including his daughter and\nson-in-law, Jared Kushner. Reporters seemed to like her and, eventually,\ngrew to respect her. They also knew that she was umbilically connected\nto her principal. Not only did she sit right outside the president’s\noffice, but she was also in touch with him constantly during the few\nhours they were apart. Often, she would be on the phone with Trump as\nshe hurried through the White House security checkpoint early in the\nmorning. According to someone familiar with the situation, Hicks would\nask the Secret Service agents if she could go through the metal\ndetectors with her cell phone. They didn’t much care who was on the\nline; she would need to follow protocol. “Hang on,” she would tell the\npresident, according to this person. “I’m putting you through the\nconveyor belt.” Then she’d pick right back up talking as she entered\nthe building, where she would see him a few minutes later.</p>\n<p>Over time, however, the schedule and scrutiny, the mix of heightened\nprofessional responsibility and lack of control over her personal life,\nstarted to weigh heavily on Hicks. Close as she and Trump had become, he\ncould blow up her day with a pre-dawn tweet. Hicks also faces the\nprospect of legal bills stemming from the various federal investigations\ninto the campaign. Her entire life played out within a short radius\naround the White House. Hicks considered leaving, and she labored over\nthe rollout of her departure. For a time, Ivanka and Kushner persuaded\nher to stick it out. According to people familiar with her thinking, she\nalso didn’t want to create the impression that one particular news event\nhad hastened her exit. But her departure was unfurled soon after the\npaparazzi discovered that she was dating White House staff secretary Rob\nPorter.</p>\n<p>In late January 2018, Hicks and Porter joined other members of the White\nHouse communications team, including Hogan Gidley and Josh Raffel, who\nhad become Hicks’s closest friend stemming from their time together at\nHiltzik, at Gidley’s apartment. After a subsequent group dinner at Rosa\nMexicano, a photographer with a long lens caught Hicks and Porter\nkissing in the backseat of a taxi on their way home together. EXCLUSIVE:\nWHITE HOUSE ROMANCE! read the <em>Daily Mail</em> headline on the first day of\nFebruary. The plot quickly grew darker after the tabloid published\ninterviews with Porter’s two ex-wives, who claimed that he had\nphysically and verbally abused them. (At the time, Porter called many of\nthe allegations “slanderous and simply false.”)</p>\n<p>“It’s grating on anyone when you come with a group to my apartment and\nthere are pictures of you downstairs when you get in a cab, and there\nare pictures of you when you are in that cab. It’s so much more creepy\nand invasive when the paparazzi is strategically hidden with a telephoto\nzoom lens taking photos from afar&#8212;and that’s what they did to Hope\nevery single day,” Gidley said. “She chose to make her role a\nbehind-the-scenes one and not be an out-front spokesperson ...\nbecause she wanted a level of anonymity. At a human level, she just\nwanted to work hard and live her life without some picture being taken\non every street corner.” By the end of that month, <em>The New York Times</em>\nbroke the news that Hicks was leaving.</p>\n<p>Hicks cried when she told the communications team of her decision.\nGidley, himself emotional, teared up. “I’m ashamed to admit I was\nselfishly upset and upset for the administration, because she was so\nincredibly good at her job,” Gidley said, recalling Hicks laughing\nthrough tears when he told her he didn’t like change. “I should’ve been\nconsoling her, but she came over and hugged me.” Trump did not erupt\nwhen she told him the news; he had expected she would move on someday.\nHe gave her an uncharacteristically kind public send-off. “I consider\nit a skill to leave that White House with an elegant exit,” one person\nwho has advised Hicks professionally told me. “And she got about as\nelegant of an exit that anyone could possibly get.” On her last day,\nshe handed out notes to each staffer in her loopy, girlish penmanship.</p>\n<p><strong>After her departure,</strong> Hicks decamped to Greenwich to recuperate with her\nfamily. For a while, things had been tense in the Hicks house as her\nparents worried about her punishing hours, physical safety, and mounting\nnegative publicity. Initially, it wasn’t easy to transition from the\nfast-twitch, Trump-staffer lifestyle. “You’re used to your phone\nringing every 10 seconds,” a former White House colleague told me,\nexplaining the phenomenon, “and you start to take your phone out of\nyour pocket to check your e-mail, and you say to yourself, Oh, I didn’t\nget an e-mail. And then you check 10 seconds later and, again, you say,\nOh, I didn’t get an e-mail.” She made time for old friends, ran outside\nwithout fear of having both phones in front of her, took some weekend\ntrips out of town.</p>\n<p>Hicks didn’t totally disengage. She monitored the news and kept in touch\nwith Trump, Ivanka, and the White House communications team about\nstories and messaging. She accompanied staffers on a trip aboard Air\nForce One to central Ohio, prompting rumors that she might re-enter the\nWhite House. She was even floated as an outside contender for the\nchief-of-staff position amid the enduring John Kelly drama.</p>\n<p>Speculation was fueled, in part, because the private sector had not been\nkind to Trump alums. Reince Priebus had returned to his former law firm;\nSean Spicer had barely caught on as a Fox News commentator. Rex\nTillerson and Gary Cohn had yet to chart their new courses. Raffel would\nland on his feet at the controversial e-cigarette manufacturer Juul, and\nDina Powell settled back into a larger role at Goldman Sachs than the\none she left before she joined the administration. Hicks solicited\nadvice from Ivanka and Kushner, Powell, Cohn, and Hiltzik, who all\nencouraged her to take meetings. And she did&#8212;sometimes one at\nbreakfast, another at lunch, and then for post-work drinks or for\ndinner. There were opportunities flacking for private-equity firms and\nrepresenting wealthy finance guys. She constantly fielded the suggestion\nthat she go on television. She was attractive and articulate and no one\nknew the administration better, the suggestions went. But Hicks is\nconflict-averse by nature, and the idea of slugging it out on cable news\ndid not appeal to her. Sure, she had opinions and a story to tell, but\nnow did not feel like the right time to use her voice. She considered\nmemorializing her thoughts on paper, perhaps for a book. Nothing has\nbeen formalized yet.</p>\n<p>One adviser told me that Hicks had initial trepidation about whether she\nhad been tarnished by the Trump brand. But Hicks also realized that her\nability to work with Trump made her valuable to a narrow, but lucrative,\nmarket. “She was very deliberate in figuring out what would be right,”\nIvanka told me.</p>\n<p>Months after her departure, she had lunch with a high-profile host of a\npopular Fox News program who had become a friend. He, like many others,\nsuggested that she take a job in TV. When she demurred, he told her she\nshould meet some people at the network anyway. They walked over to the\nFox headquarters on Sixth Avenue, where she met with a few people, who\nfollowed up a couple of weeks later saying that, it so happened, Lachlan\nMurdoch was looking for someone to run communications for New Fox, the\ncompany he was starting once the assets were spun off in the Disney\nsale. The two had lunch at the Sixth Avenue headquarters.</p>\n<p>A person familiar with the hiring process told me that they called White\nHouse reporters, inquiring about what she was like to work with and\nwhether she was strategic. “With me, she had to overcome her\nrelationship with Trump, which was a straight down, not an up,” this\nperson explained. “I wondered if everyone who worked for him was out of\ntheir minds, but all of the reporters I called, from papers that were\npretty tough on the administration, all said she was smart, responsive,\nand had integrity.”</p>\n<p>Around the same time, Trump had a scheduled chat with Rupert Murdoch,\nand he mentioned that Hicks was interviewing for the job and, of course,\nrecommended her. Hicks flew to L.A. for a final round of meetings and\ninterviews. As she had for the audition nearly two decades earlier, her\nmom tagged along for fun, and joked with her not to “<em>Weakest Link</em>” it.\nBy the end of the trip, New Fox offered her the job of communications\ndirector. She thought about it for a few days before she accepted.</p>\n<p>In some ways, New Fox was an easy, familiar choice. It was run by a\nwealthy, occasionally dysfunctional family and traded in a familiar form\nof loudmouth conservatism. “It’s a little bit of Trump-lite,” one\nperson close to her told me. “You can still be a little drunk on the\nKool-Aid.”</p>\n<p>It also seemed oddly manageable given her experience. Hicks’s chief\ntalent is being someone’s barely visible hand. Lachlan Murdoch, who\nwould be her new principal, is not Donald Trump, and New Fox is not the\nTrump Organization or the White House.</p>\n<p>But, in another regard, it was going to be a challenge. In the White\nHouse, technically she answered to the American public, but her job in\nthe West Wing was always about serving her audience of one. Running\ncommunications for a public company, where you answer to shareholders\nand are constantly held accountable by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and no-fucks-to-give veteran reporters, is a\ntruth-elasticity-free zone. White lies are possibly fireable offenses.</p>\n<p>But the job offered one undeniable advantage. It was in a place where\nlong-lens photographers would stake out other, far more famous young\nwomen, outside the psychic mindlock of the Acela corridor. Hicks was\nhesitant to move so far from her family. But her relationship with\nPorter had ended months before; she had no long-term lease on an\napartment. She decided to follow her new principal. “I don’t think she\nwas looking one way or another to move or not to move,” one longtime\nclose friend explained. “But it was an opportunity. It was a fresh\nstart.” She joked with friends that her parents wanted her to have a\nhealthy relationship, so she decided to move to L.A.</p>\n<p><strong>The sun still</strong> had not fully broken through the late-fall darkness when a\ntwentysomething woman in a neon sports bra and black Lululemons cranked\nup an old Chris Brown remix and pulled down a set of multi-colored\nresistance bands suspended from the ceiling. The boutique fitness\nstudio, heated to well over 90 degrees, was filled with a half-dozen\nyoung women who were there to bounce about the springy, wide-paneled\nwood floor, pull down those bands with their lithe, twiggy arms, and\nlift their ankles strapped with 1.5-pound weights about a million times\nin a row while the remixes blasted. On any given morning, Gwyneth\nPaltrow or Jennifer Lopez or Tracee Ellis Ross could have been there.</p>\n<p>That morning, though, there were no <em>celebrity</em> celebrities. There was one\nwoman in the back row, though, in a navy moisture-wicking turtleneck and\na headband, as if she were dressed for a brisk winter run at Deerfield.\nTo be fair, it is unlikely that anyone would have expected to see Hicks\nin a dance cardio class fit for Hollywood starlets at six o’clock in the\nmorning. That is the beauty of Hollywood for Hicks. No one\nbatted an eye when she went to dinner at Spago at the end of the year,\nbecause Oprah was at a table behind her. (Her mom pleaded with her to go\nup to the mega-star. “Go tell her you’ll run her 2020 campaign!” she\nteased. Hicks did not, but she did take a not-so-great photo of her on\nher cell phone.) No one paid attention to her when she attended a Drake\nconcert, or spent an afternoon at Universal Studios. When she walked\ninto the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel for coffee one November\nmorning&#8212;reveling in the plaids of her Greenwich youth&#8212;no one in the\nplace looked her way. Hicks didn’t check her phone during the entirety\nof the class, which ended near midday on the East Coast. There was no\nfear of a missed call or tweet, a new fresh hell.</p>\n<p>Hicks still wakes up at four A.M., though more out of habit than\nnecessity. She has not once turned on the television in her apartment,\naccording to someone familiar with her new routine, and opted against\ninstalling one in her office. She reads the paper in print leisurely in\nthe morning, and listens to audiobooks at home and on her commute to\nwork. Once she gets to the office, around nine A.M., she, like her\nformer boss, will make notes on paper copies of stories and send them,\nsnail mail, to her family, or to people in the administration who might\nget ideas about speeches or policy positions. She tells her assistant to\nkeep the first hour of her day free, her own executive time.</p>\n<p>Most days, she is home by six P.M., and is content to keep to herself,\nat least for now. She never mingled much with the Washington set or\nreporters in a social way when she was on the campaign or in the White\nHouse, and so far her life in Los Angeles seems to be much the same.\n“She’s focused on setting up a good life, and she is all-in on work,”\none longtime friend told me. “Hope is not someone who needs a lot of\nacquaintances and 10 girlfriends. She values quality over quantity, and\nshe invests in people who she is really close with.” She still texts\nwith Ivanka and Gidley and sees Raffel when he visits Los Angeles. The\npresident still calls her, too.</p>\n<p>There are many questions about what will happen to New Fox, which is\ncompeting in a universe against far larger media behemoths as consumers\ncontinue to cut the cord and pivot to streaming services. Fox News still\nthrows off more than a billion in profit, but its audience is well\nbeyond retirement age, and the company’s other core properties (its\nsports networks and Fox Business) may not provide a bulletproof hedge\nagainst the digital future. Media observers wonder whether Rupert\nMurdoch, who has traditionally led with his gut, has erred in entrusting\nso much responsibility to a 30-year-old with no experience at a public\ncompany and major Trump baggage&#8212;not to mention whatever potential\nlegal entanglements she might face down the line. Meanwhile, Hicks has\ndone little to offer clues to political junkies. Was she a\nco-conspirator in Trumpworld, or someone just along for the ride? A\ncunning political operator, or an indifferent player with highly attuned\nGreenwich-style social skills? Younger than the vast majority of her\nformer colleagues, will she forever be remembered for something she did\nin her 20s? The Murdochs, for their part, have told people they’re\nimpressed with her work so far, according to those who have spoken with\nthem about Hicks.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the greatest indication that Hicks is, in fact, highly skilled\nat this kind of work is the way in which she has managed her own P.R. In\na campaign and White House where nearly every person became the story at\nsome point, Hicks was able to largely stay out of sight. She’d be lucky\nto maintain this quality in her new life, as she starts the rest of it\nfresh. Indeed, where better to test that out than in L.A.&#8212;a city based\non re-invention? “This is where people come to re-write themselves,”\nthe Hollywood executive told me. “If, at the end of the year, if she\nlasts that long, and she’s at a party, I can’t see people not\ngravitating towards her. She has a big job. People don’t stay in\nHollywood jail forever, not if you’re that pretty.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The family drama surrounding <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/biden-2020-front-runner-family-divorce-drama?inline\">Joe Biden’s presidential bid</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; What to make of the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/buzzfeed-mueller-saga-veteran-journalists-circumspect-confused?inline\">BuzzFeed-Mueller mystery</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; A happy ending for one <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/fyre-festival-caterer-gofundme-maryann-rolle?inline\">Fyre Festival contractor</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Intrigue in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jesse-angelo-abruptly-exits-the-new-york-post-murdoch?inline\">Murdoch-land</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Yes, <em>Schitt’s Creek</em> really is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/yes-schitts-creek-really-is-that-good?inline\">that good</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"From The Magazine","socialTitle":"Hope Hicks, West Wing Alum, Begins Her Second Act on the West Coast","socialDescription":"After years in the Trump orbit, Hicks has entered a brave new world of Murdochs, fussy trade reporters, and Los Angeles semiotics.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences confirmed late Friday <em>A Star Is Born</em> stars <strong>Lady Gaga</strong> and <strong>Bradley Cooper</strong> will perform the Oscar-nominated “Shallow” during the February 24 broadcast.

His early appointments of <strong>Rex Tillerson, Jeff Sessions, Nikki Haley, Gary Cohn, H.R. McMaster, [John] Kelly,</strong> and <strong>[James] Mattis</strong> were encouraging,” he writes. “But, on balance, his conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions last month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.” He credits Trump for cutting taxes, deregulating business, and making conservative judicial appointments, but moves quickly to reject the president’s conduct and foreign policy as unbecoming of his office.</p>\n<p>The timing, however, is notable&#8212;and immediately raised suspicions among the president’s allies that Romney could be trouble down the line. On Tuesday night, shortly after Romney’s op-ed was published, a Republican National Committee representative e-mailed other members of the committee, urging them to change the rules to protect Trump from a primary challenger, Hive contributor <strong>David M. Drucker</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/romneys-attack-prompts-call-to-protect-trump-from-2020-primary-challenger\">reports</a> for the <em>Washington Examiner.</em> The following morning, R.N.C. chair <strong>Ronna McDaniel</strong>&#8212;better known as Ronna <em>Romney</em> McDaniel&#8212;denounced her uncle’s op-ed without mentioning him by name. Later, in perhaps the clearest sign that Trump allies consider Romney to be a legitimate threat, Senator <strong>Rand Paul</strong> announced he would be going on Fox News to respond to his colleague’s “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/1080531251499622401\">unfair criticism</a>” of the president.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/GOPChairwoman/status/1080475217850519552\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GOPChairwoman/status/1080475217850519552\">https://twitter.com/GOPChairwoman/status/1080475217850519552</a></p></blockquote></div><p>What Romney intended to accomplish by stirring the pot is unclear. The 2012 Republican presidential candidate will likely follow in the footsteps of the late John McCain, as well as recently retired senators <strong>Jeff Flake</strong> and <strong>Bob Corker,</strong> becoming another milquetoast voice of dissent who complains about Trump’s decorum while voting in lockstep with the party. Romney, after all, has been less principled than his words suggest. He sought Trump’s endorsement in 2012, when Trump was a leader of the birther conspiracy, then condemned him in March 2016 as a “phony,” a “fraud,” and a misogynist whose “promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University.” After the election, Romney met with Trump to discuss becoming secretary of state and, during his campaign for Senate last year, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/mitt-romney-utah-campaign-trump\">repeatedly indicated</a> that he would play nice with the president if their interests aligned. “I’m an honest enough person that if he does something right&#8212;and by the way he’s done a number of things right&#8212;I’ll be fully supportive of those things,” he said. “I will support the president’s agenda when it’s good for Utah, and good for the country, and so far that’s been the case.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/brithume/status/1080319911099072512\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brithume/status/1080319911099072512\">https://twitter.com/brithume/status/1080319911099072512</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Perhaps, as Romney says in his op-ed, it was the elimination of moderating voices like Tillerson, Haley, Cohn, Kelly, and Mattis that moved him to speak. At 71, Romney is worth more than a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mitt-romney-is-worth-250-million-why-so-little/2012/10/05/64128882-0c20-11e2-a310-2363842b7057_story.html\">quarter billion dollars</a> and has little to lose by doing so. Utah, the most solidly anti-Trump red state in the nation, is the perfect staging ground for a campaign to restore the Republican Party’s moral luster out of a sense of civic duty. Unlike Flake, Corker, or Senator <strong>Ben Sasse,</strong> Romney has the national name recognition and gravitas to have some measure of influence.</p>\n<p>The greater fear in Trumpworld, as evidenced by the panic inside the R.N.C., is that Romney harbors grander ambitions. Nobody in Washington knows precisely what <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> might reveal when he delivers his report on Russian collusion. House Democrats are preparing a fusillade of subpoenas and congressional hearings that will dig into every Trump scandal over the past two years. And the U.S. economy, which has been on a tear for a decade, is beginning to slow. If Trump falters and Republicans begin to have their doubts, Romney could be their champion-in-waiting. His op-ed was aimed squarely at those voters who are “severely conservative,” as Romney famously described himself, but who have become increasingly uncomfortable with Trump. Until now, there was no singular, prominent political figure for those who like Trump’s policies but oppose the man.</p>\n<p>Is it a coincidence that this week marks the unofficial beginning of the 2020 primary season? <strong>Jevon Williams,</strong> the R.N.C. committeeman who called to cancel the 2020 primaries, apparently sees the writing on the wall. “Look, the political history is clear. No Republican president opposed for re-nomination has ever won re-election,” he warned. “While President Trump would win re-nomination it wouldn’t come quick and it wouldn’t be inexpensive.” Other political commentators have noted that Romney would almost certainly go down in flames against a president who, despite his many flaws, has the support of <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx\">more than 80 percent</a> of Republican voters. But Romney doesn’t actually have to run to toss his hat in the ring. His op-ed has already accomplished that. If Trump goes down before the election, for whatever reason, Romney has made it clear he’s ready and available.</p>\n<p><em>Update: Later Wednesday, R.N.C. committeeman <strong>Morton Blackwell</strong> weighed in on the primary controversy, asserting that it is already too late to block a 2020 Republican challenger. The ballot, should Romney seek it, is open.</em></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/timkmak/status/1080592508290326528\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/timkmak/status/1080592508290326528\">https://twitter.com/timkmak/status/1080592508290326528</a></p></blockquote></div><h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Why the Democrats <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/nancy-pelosi-impeachment-strategy?inline\">won’t rush to impeach Trump</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Joe Lieberman jumps into the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/the-us-china-battle-for-technological-supremacy-takes-a-strange-turn?inline\">U.S.-China trade war</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; A guilty plea that should make the N.R.A. <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/why-maria-butinas-guilty-plea-should-make-the-nra-nervous?inline\">feel nervous</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Trump thinks <em>S.N.L.</em> should be <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/donald-trump-snl-unfair-should-be-tested-in-courts?inline\">challenged in the courts</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; A new Time’s Up initiative, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/new-times-up-initiative-uses-money-from-cbs-grant?inline\">courtesy of . . .

Eleven years after a young <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> purchased an aging skyscraper that would become an albatross around his family’s neck, and six months before the Kushners would have to cough up the $1.4 billion that was due on the mortgage for 666 Fifth Avenue, a Canadian asset-management company <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/nyregion/kushners-building-fifth-avenue-brookfield-lease.html\">swooped in</a> and agreed to take a 99-year lease on the building, paying a near-century’s worth of rent upfront. The bailout was surprising for a few reasons, chief among them being comments by the Kushners’ previous partner that 666 Fifth “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/is-jared-kushner-the-worlds-worst-real-estate-investor\">would be worth a lot more if it was just dirt</a>,” plus the fact that the family had spent two years trying to get new partners or financing to no avail. Also, there was the matter of the Qatar Investment Authority being a major investor in the company, Brookfield Asset Management, and Kushner’s <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/jared-kushner-backed-qatar-blockade-after-qataris-wouldnt-finance-his-property-828847\">support of a Saudi- and U.A.E.-led blockade of Qatar</a>. To some, it sure <em>sounded</em> like a foreign government was trying to influence policy by greasing the president’s son-in-law’s wheels! At the time, Brookfield told reporters that the Qataris “had no knowledge of the deal before its public announcement”&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/nyregion/kushner-deal-qatar-666-5th.html\">apparently they don’t read <em>The New York Times</em></a>&#8212;and now that the deal has officially gone through, Doha is doubling down, insisting, somewhat curiously, that the government <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qatar-fund-kushner-insight/qatar-revamps-investment-strategy-after-kushner-building-bailout-idUSKCN1Q00W3\">had absolutely nothing to do with the 666 debacle</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When news emerged that Qatar may have unwittingly helped bail out a New York skyscraper owned by the family of Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, eyebrows were raised in Doha. . . . The bailout, in which Doha played no part and first learned about in the media, has prompted a rethink of how the gas-rich kingdom invests money abroad via its giant sovereign wealth fund, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The country has decided that the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) will aim to avoid putting money in funds or other investment vehicles it does not have full control over, according to the sources, who are familiar with the QIA’s strategy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Qatar started looking into how its name got involved into the deal and found out it was because of a fund it co-owned,” said one of the sources. “So QIA ultimately triggered a strategy revamp.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is it possible that Qatar truly had no knowledge of its role in doing a major solid for the Kushners just months before a make-or-break deadline?

One stop on his itinerary is likely to steal the show.","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>This weekend, <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> will board a military plane and embark on a six-country trip to present foreign diplomats with part of his long-awaited proposal to solve an epic quandary and bring peace to the Middle East. Kushner has said that he and the other members of the trip, including Middle East envoy <strong>Jason Greenblatt,</strong> State Department policy adviser <strong>Brian Hook,</strong> and deputy assistant to the president <strong>Avi Berkowitz,</strong> will not present the full peace plan until after the Israeli elections in April. Instead, they will gauge support for various economic incentives in the proposal, including foreign aid for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. These enticements are intended to persuade Palestinian officials to seek a broader deal.</p>\n<p>Over the course of seven days, Kushner’s team will travel to Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey. They will also make a stop in Saudi Arabia, where Kushner plans to meet with Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman.</strong> It will be the first time the two will meet since 15 Saudis brutally strangled <em>Washington Post</em> journalist Jamal Khashoggi and dismembered him with a bone saw last fall.</p>\n<p>Kushner and M.B.S., as he is known, struck up a relationship nearly two years ago, when the Saudi prince visited the White House. Kushner and M.B.S., youthful heirs with complex family rivalries, have met a handful of times since. For a while, it was a mutually beneficial alliance. M.B.S. provided Kushner with a key ally and envoy in the region. Kushner, in turn, convinced his father-in-law to make Riyadh his first stop on a sweeping presidential tour of the Middle East, and helped promote an arms deal between the United States and the kingdom. But their bond came under great scrutiny last fall, after the assassination of Khashoggi.</p>\n<p>In the days following, Kushner reached out to M.B.S as the administration launched its investigation, and urged him to be as transparent as possible. (The C.I.A. later concluded that M.B.S. ordered the operation, although the Saudi government has denied the crown prince played any role in the killing.) In a rare town-hall interview with CNN in October, Kushner offered a chilling realpolitik explanation for the administration’s failure to condemn the Saudis. “We have to be able to work with our allies,” he said. “The Middle East is a rough place. It’s been a rough place for a very long time, and we have to be able to pursue our strategic objectives, but we also have to deal with what obviously seems to be a terrible situation.”</p>\n<p>The uncomfortable optics of the meeting are not lost on those planning the road show. But Kushner is meeting with the heads of states from the region, a person familiar with the trip explained, and M.B.S. is a head of state. Indeed, Saudi Arabia appears to be the lynchpin of Kushner’s unprecedented strategy to forge lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Whereas past administrations sought to negotiate with both parties, the Trump White House is hoping to assemble a coalition of Gulf states aligned against Iran to exert influence in the region.</p>\n<p>The whirlwind tour will come on the heels of a two-day conference in Warsaw last week, during which Kushner met with leaders from 60 countries and obliquely discussed the plan. Israeli Prime Minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu,</strong> who was in attendance during Kushner’s closed-door presentation, reportedly <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/israel-gulf-states-commend-kushners-peace-effort-11550182508\">congratulated</a> him for being “crazy enough” to “come up with ideas” to resolve the conflict. A foreign-affairs minister from Saudi Arabia also offered support for Kushner’s plan, according to <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Palestinian officials, who have not engaged in peace talks since the U.S. moved its embassy to Jerusalem, did not attend the conference. On Friday, Kushner, the grandson of Holocaust survivors, joined Vice President <strong>Mike Pence</strong> at Auschwitz-Birkenau, before they flew to Germany for the weekend to attend the Munich Security Conference. Kushner’s wife, <strong>Ivanka Trump,</strong> also made the trip.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Much has been said recently, both inside and outside the White House, about Jared and Ivanka’s influence within the Trump administration. The couple survived a series of power struggles with <strong>Steve Bannon, Sean Spicer, Reince Priebus,</strong> and finally <strong>John Kelly.</strong> With the West Wing thinned out, aides have been referring to Kushner as the de facto chief of staff, one person close to the couple told me. But it’s not that Jared or Ivanka have more power as a result of others leaving. It’s that Trumpworld is finally beginning to understand the extent of the power they’ve had all along. “They’ve always been son and daughter of a president who is a famously familial person,” this person said. “The people who misunderstood that are no longer there. Everything takes time, and they have the luxury of time in this administration when most other people do not.”</p>\n<p>Trump, of course, is most comfortable when the West Wing is operating as a family office. It was how he ran his business in Trump Tower, and it remains the best way to assess who has staying power. It also helps to explain why, despite an anti-nepotism law that stood for 50 years, he deputized his son-in-law to lead some of the most significant foreign policy initiatives of his administration, any why his daughter frequently represents the administration on trips abroad. While the rest of the White House is in a state of constant turnover, Kushner remains firmly ensconced in a closet of an office near the Oval. Ivanka has a sunny corner room just upstairs, outside of which hangs a blown-up photo of her and Kushner dancing onstage at inauguration, with a note from her dad scrawled out in gold Sharpie, saying how proud of them he was.</p>\n<p>They still worry about how they are portrayed in the media, though the negative press has slowed as their antagonists have left the White House. When Ivanka sat down with ABC for an interview earlier this year, she was caught off guard by questions she thought had been deemed off limits, according to two people familiar with the situation. But as time has gone on, Jared and Ivanka, like everyone else, have cared less and less about about each individual story. The country, after all, has reached a late stage of Trump fatigue. Though news cameras panned to take in Ivanka’s stony expression in Munich when German chancellor <strong>Angela Merkel</strong> criticized her father’s foreign policy, the schadenfreude was fleeting. Back in New York, their social circle is similarly dazed. One former friend of the couple shrugged when NBC News <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/officials-rejected-jared-kushner-top-secret-security-clearance-were-overruled-n962221\">reported</a> that Kushner had only gotten his security clearance restored after a Trump appointee overrode the recommendation of career White House security specialists. “Tomorrow, no one is going to talk about this,” this person said. “Is anything ever going to stick?”</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Middle East","socialTitle":"Jared Kushner Is Preparing for Another Face-to-Face Meeting with M.B.S.","socialDescription":"Kushner is embarking on a six-country tour to begin rolling out his Middle East peace plan.

Like <strong>Omarosa Manigault Newman, Sean Spicer, Mr. Mooch,</strong> and all the previous Dickensian characters gunning for their own spin-off series, the former governor of New Jersey has picked up a pen to put his dysfunctional time around the White House to paper. The book, <em>Let Me Finish,</em> isn’t only about the president’s son-in-law, <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> who manages to wield power in Washington despite all odds, but much of it is, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/chris-christie-book-trump.html\"><strong>Maggie Haberman’s</strong> report</a> in <em>The New York Times.</em></p>\n<p>The two men have a history. When he was U.S. attorney for New Jersey, Christie prosecuted Jared’s father, <strong>Charles Kushner,</strong> on 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering, and making illegal campaign donations. The elder Kushner served 14 months at a federal prison camp in Alabama beginning in 2005. (He served the rest of his term in a halfway house in Newark.) Kushner the younger, then 25, visited him on most weekends, and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/12/jared-kushner-education-donald-trump\">reportedly blames Christie</a> for refusing to release the elder Kushner from his sentence 28 days early, as the family expected.</p>\n<p>And now, Christie claims, Kushner’s son held the grudge for years. He describes a meeting in which <strong>Donald Trump</strong> put together his transition team, when Kushner said, in front of Christie, “He tried to destroy my father.” Christie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/11/chris-christie-dropped-trump-transition-team\">was eventually replaced</a> by Vice President <strong>Mike Pence&#8212;</strong> though at the time, Christie was dealing with impeachment murmurs in Trenton after two of his former aides were convicted on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/11/chris-christie-dropped-trump-transition-team\">counts related to the notorious Bridgegate incident</a>. Still, he remained close to the White House, and as his name came up for various appointments like attorney general and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/us/politics/chris-christie-trump-chief-staff.html?module=inline\">chief of staff</a>, he would hear from various staffers that Kushner had intervened. He would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn’t for that meddling kid.</p>\n<p>So how do you undermine the underminer in this administration, in this particular MAGA moment? Accuse someone of eating salads <em>every day.</em> Kushner decided to join a lunch that Christie and his wife had scheduled with President Trump on Valentine’s Day 2017. As Kushner was enjoying one of his “typical salads,” Christie wrote, Trump expressed confusion over why firing <strong>Michael Flynn</strong> didn’t end the Russia probe, while Christie laughed in his face, per the former governor’s telling:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“‘Sir,’ I said, ‘this Russia thing is far from over,’” Mr. Christie\nwrote. Mr. Trump responded: “What do you mean? Flynn met with the\nRussians. That was the problem. I fired Flynn. It’s over.” Mr. Kushner\nadded, “That’s right, firing Flynn ends the whole Russia thing.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What else can you expect from a person who eats <em>leaves</em>? Christie is making a wise move here, positioning himself as the one guy who can save the Trump White House from the self-inflicted damage of listening to salad-eaters. Maybe it will pay off for him in the Infowars-supplement crowd.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Behind the scenes of Rent’s new <a

son-in-law and senior adviser, is hoping he can break the impasse between <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and the Democrats on immigration, reportedly spitballing solutions to the problem during a White House whiteboard meeting last week in an effort to, as one attendee told Axios, “replicate” for border security the kind of bipartisan deal he managed to strike on criminal-justice reform. “They would like to try and replicate at some level a bipartisan coalition on immigration issues, something paired with border security as well,” <strong>Mark Holden,</strong> a Koch Industries executive, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/jared-kushner-immigration-plans-government-shutdown-f5e144d4-5342-4509-a56e-627eb1a8a9c1.html\">told</a> the publication.</p>\n<p>It’s an ambitious&#8212;and likely unrealistic&#8212;undertaking. Last year, Kushner convinced Trump, who ran as a law-and-order candidate, to sign a bill that emphasized reducing recidivism rates, providing exemptions to mandatory minimum sentences, and expanding opportunities for early release in what was seen as a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/criminal-justice-reform-bill-metaphor-for-the-trump-presidency-that-wasnt\">strong step</a> toward improving the broken criminal-justice system. In that instance, however, he was simply nailing down specifics around a bipartisan consensus. As a senior White House official put it to Axios, “He convinced Democrats to support something they already agreed with.”</p>\n<p>That’s not so with immigration. Here, Trump’s marquee demand is his long-promised border wall, which he wants close to $6 billion in taxpayer dollars to build. Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, have no desire or reason to give it to him, particularly after Trump caved on his own request last week and reopened the government without a cent for the wall. To get Dems to budge, Kushner will have to offer a concession significant enough for them to consider yielding the upper hand. The problem, of course, lies in convincing his father-in-law to go along with such a concession, especially in the face of inevitable backlash from his base.</p>\n<p>Further complicating the issue is Trump’s warning that, if a bipartisan panel doesn’t come up with a workable solution by February 15, he’ll either shut down the government again&#8212;something <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> and other Republicans on Capitol Hill have suggested they <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/427574-no-gop-appetite-for-a-second-shutdown\">could overrule</a>&#8212;or declare a national emergency to fund the wall without Congress. Putting the nuclear option on the table, as Trump apparently did against Kushner’s wishes, may already have doomed a potential compromise. After all, what motivation does Trump’s base have to go along with a middle ground when they’re convinced he can easily avoid compromising altogether?</p>\n<p>Given all the obstacles in his path, even conservatives are questioning why Kushner thinks he can succeed where so many others have failed. “Border security and immigration reform are much more complex issues than criminal justice reform,” Tea Party Patriots co-founder <strong>Jenny Beth Martin</strong> told Axios. Kushner’s mandate, which includes nothing less than the reinvention of the executive branch itself, has always seemed comically broad, in part due to his total lack of relevant experience or expertise. But with two parties at total loggerheads, and apparently no confidence from the president, he seems especially in over his head, despite his insistence that he’s the one who can “land this plane.” “Unless he’s able to convince his father-in-law to abandon his obsession with building a medieval border wall,” Rep. <strong>Hakeem Jeffries</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/us/politics/jared-kushner-immigration-reform.html\">told</a> <em>The New York Times,</em> “then he’s not going to be successful in finding a bipartisan agreement.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The family drama surrounding <a

But, possessed of the same delusional self-confidence that’s led him to reckon <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/jared-kushner-sean-hannity-saudi-arabia\"><em>he</em>’s going to be the guy to finally bring peace the Middle East</a>, the Boy Prince of New Jersey apparently believes he’s just days away from getting the Democrats to crack.</p>\n<p><em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/master-negotiator-or-nonentity-kushner-thrusts-himself-into-middle-of-shutdown-debate/2019/01/23/a8b5bf42-1e69-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html\">reports</a> that Kushner, “fueled by a burst of self-confidence following his help in passing criminal-justice legislation”&#8212;which, as a refresher, had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/politics/senate-criminal-justice-bill.html\">wide bipartisan support</a>&#8212;has recently “thrust” himself in the middle of shutdown talks, positive that he will be the dealmaker to break the impasse while somehow also getting <strong>Donald Trump</strong> his wall:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Repeatedly assuring Trump that he can personally strike a deal with Democrats, Kushner has overshadowed other advisers in a largely empty West Wing this month. He usually huddles to discuss strategy each morning with the president, Vice President Pence and a few others, White House aides said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Convinced that Senate Democrats will eventually crack and that there are votes for a bipartisan agreement, Kushner has urged the president to dig in while also adjusting his position as his popularity suffers in public polls, according to a person close to him and White House officials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the <em>Post,</em> “Kushner’s imprint” was all over the president’s offer to Democrats last weekend, which <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> immediately rejected. Yet the First Son-in-Law is unbowed, telling advisers that he has “solid relationships with several Democrats” and “can sell a compromise” to moderate lawmakers “with whom he built a rapport while working on the criminal-justice bill.” Except there’s one small flaw in that plan:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“He is totally a nonentity,” one senior Democratic aide said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, Senator <strong>Lisa Murkowski,</strong> one of those key moderates who Kushner evidently believes he has a great rapport with, said Wednesday that <strong>Ivanka’s</strong> husband “doesn’t have the experience” of someone like Pence, who actually worked on Capitol Hill. “It’s really hard to understand the dynamics unless you’ve really been immersed in this,” she added, presumably trying to let Little Kush down easy.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, White House mouthpiece <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> has gone on the record to claim “it’s no wonder the President asked him to join the negotiating team to work on a deal to open the government and secure our border,” on account of Kushner’s work on criminal-justice reform and a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/10/01/trumps-new-nafta-is-pretty-much-the-same-as-the-old-one-but-at-what-cost/?utm_term=.00d685353e10\">essentially the same as the old agreement</a>. Behind the scenes, however, administration officials are more skeptical:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Shahira Knight,</strong> the legislative affairs director, has expressed unease with the White House’s operation during the shutdown. Another senior White House official called Kushner’s positioning “delusional.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Trump reportedly endorsed Kushner’s efforts in a recent Oval Office meeting, in a backhanded sort of way. “Apparently, Jared has become an expert on immigration in the last 48 hours,” he exclaimed (playfully!), according to people in the room. Less confident in the Kush is acting chief of staff <strong>Mick Mulvaney,</strong> who is reportedly making preparations for the government shutdown to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/white-house-seeks-list-of-programs-that-would-be-hurt-if-shutdown-lasts-into-march/2019/01/23/661adb3a-1f55-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html\">continue through March, or even April</a>. Luckily, should it come to that, Jared is an expert on <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/oops-jared-kushner-forgot-to-pay-electric-bill\">missing payments</a> and <a

has some interesting views on federal crime.","body":"<p>The Trump White House was always bound to be a low-wattage operation, considering the professional grifters the campaign attracted. Candidate Trump, after all, never actually planned on <em>winning</em> the election. Still, the incoming administration had a chance to avoid making complete and total fools of itself in the months before the inauguration, by (begrudgingly) hiring <strong>Chris Christie</strong> to run federally-mandated preparations to take over the government. While hardly anyone’s idea of a political savant, the former governor of New Jersey was at the very least a semi-competent manager who had served as both a federal prosecutor and in an executive role. Christie, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/27/this-guy-doesnt-know-anything-the-inside-story-of-trumps-shambolic-transition-team\">by all accounts</a>, spent much of 2016 trying to find quality Republican establishment appointees to serve in the administration, so that Trump’s government might have a chance at functioning. But shortly after winning the election, the ex-Miss Universe owner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/27/this-guy-doesnt-know-anything-the-inside-story-of-trumps-shambolic-transition-team\">decided</a> to unceremoniously fire the guy, throw his team’s work in the trash, and handle things “more or less by himself,” a turn of events that led to the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-didnt-realize-a-government-shutdown-would-shut-down-the-government\">bumbling shit-show that is our current executive branch</a>. And apparently, we have <strong>Jared Kushner’s</strong> unique view of the law to thank for that.</p>\n<p>In a memoir slated for release at the end of the month, the ex&#8211;New Jersey governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/15/chris-christie-book-jared-kushner-accusations-hit-job\">accuses</a> the First Son-in-Law of carrying out a political “hit job” on him as revenge for prosecuting his father, <strong>Charles Kushner,</strong> a decade prior. For those not up to speed on the criminal history of the president’s in-laws, in 2005, Kushner the Elder pleaded guilty to 18 counts of illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering, following an investigation by then&#8211;U.S. Attorney Chris Christie. The witness-tampering charge was a result of Chuck’s decision to retaliate against his sister’s husband, <strong>William Schulder,</strong> who was cooperating with the feds, by hiring a sex worker to seduce him, filming the encounter, and sending the tape to his sister. Jared, unsurprisingly, had bad feelings about his father going to prison for 14 months, though his anger didn’t lie with his (extremely guilty) dad but rather prosecutors, who a man now working in the upper echelons of the U.S. government believed had overstepped their bounds.  During an April 2016 meeting, the Boy Prince of New Jersey reportedly pleaded with his father-in-law not to name Christie transition chairman, implying, per Christie, that “I had acted unethically and inappropriately,” and making the bold claim that when it came to the sex tape and the blackmailing, such things were “family matter[s], matter[s] to be handled by the family or the rabbis.”</p>\n<p>Trump ended up hiring Christie anyway, but Jared, who seemingly believes criminal acts should be settled at a diner on the New Jersey Turnpike, never relented. Shortly after the election, he got his wish: Christie was given the heave-ho and told by then&#8211;senior adviser <strong>Steve Bannon</strong> that “one person only was responsible for the . . . execution . . . Jared Kushner, still apparently seething over events that had occurred decades ago,” an account <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/27/this-guy-doesnt-know-anything-the-inside-story-of-trumps-shambolic-transition-team\">echoed</a> in <strong>Michael Lewis’s</strong> book about the administration. “The kid’s been taking an ax to your head with the boss ever since I got here,” Bannon apparently told Christie.</p>\n<p>While the former governor of New Jersey has his own history of <a href=\"https://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/mc-nws-nj-bridgegate-cost-15-million-20180430-story.html\">political revenge</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/15-chris-christie-controversies-you-missed-101999\">corruption</a>, and score-settling, Jared Kushner has gone on the record with his belief that his father did nothing wrong in committing a host of federal crimes. In 2009, he <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/57891/index1.html\">explained</a> to <em>New York</em> magazine that his father was actually the true victim in all this: “His siblings stole every piece of paper from his office, and they took it to the government,” Jared insisted, not mentioning that the things on the pieces of paper showed evidence his father had committed a cornucopia of crimes. “Siblings that he literally made wealthy for doing nothing. He gave them interests in the business for nothing. All he did was put the tape together and send it. Was it the right thing to do? At the end of the day, it was a function of saying, ‘You’re trying to make my life miserable? Well, I’m doing the same.’”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Lessons from the “Trump and the Media” <a

While in Palm Beach, Florida, the couple decompressed from their political power positions, and the stress of the government shutdown, by venturing out to the local multiplex to see a movie.</p>\n<p>The duo had an array of screening options. If they wanted to go light, they could have seen <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/mary-poppins-returns-movie-review-emily-blunt\">Mary Poppins Returns</a>.</em> If they wanted to feel hopeful about the next chapter of their lives, they could have checked out <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/jennifer-lopez-movie-interview\"><strong>Jennifer Lopez’s</strong></a> feel-good comedy <em>Second Act.</em> If they were in darker moods, they could have opted for the gritty <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/nicole-kidman-destroyer-big-little-lies\"><strong>Nicole Kidman</strong></a> thriller <em>Destroyer.</em> But for controversial key figures in a highly divisive political administration, the couple went in an interesting direction, according to <a href=\"https://people.com/politics/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-saw-vice-but-left/\"><em>People</em></a>&#8212;by seeing <em>Vice,</em> <strong>Adam McKay’s</strong> biopic about <em>another</em> controversial key figure in a highly divisive political administration: <strong>Dick Cheney.</strong></p>\n<p>Sure, it is a little curious why the president’s senior aides were at a Florida multiplex at all during a government shutdown. (Though <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/christian-bale-vice-heart-attack\"><strong>Christian Bale</strong></a> really is great.) And if they <em>were</em> going to wait out their administration’s consequential political decision in a movie theater, why wouldn’t they at least pick a different film? Aren’t movies supposed to be escapes from our own dark realities?</p>\n<p>But there is another intriguing detail to the report: “Partway through the showing, [Trump] and Kushner and their Secret Service detail got up and left,” per <em>People.</em> “It remains unclear what prompted the exit, though the witness describes it as abrupt.”</p>\n<p>What was the reason behind the sudden exit? A source close to the administration confirms to <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s <strong>Emily Jane Fox</strong> that the couple did see the movie during their vacation, and did exit early&#8212;though close to the end of the film. So they could not have been upset by Bale and <strong>Amy Adams’s</strong> bedroom <em>Macbeth</em> monologue, which takes place about halfway through the film, or the split-second cutaway to a young <strong>Donald Trump.</strong> If they had been shaken by the portrayal of a morally bankrupt business executive pursuing his own personal interests inside the White House, they presumably would have left a little earlier in the film.</p>\n<p>So maybe it was the gory heart-attack details that got to them? Maybe the early exit was just a security precaution. Or maybe there was simply an issue with the babysitter&#8212;er, two nannies&#8212;at home.</p>\n<p><em>Vice</em> is not the only entertainment project premiering last year that McKay used to hold a mirror up to the members of the First Family. McKay also executive produces the HBO series <em>Succession,</em> which was partially inspired by the trials of Kushner’s family.</p>\n<p>“The show very much reflects our time&#8212;this whole idea of a generation of rich kids who have this sense of entitlement. We see examples of it every day in the press, particularly in relation to our POTUS,” McKay told <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/hbo-succession-rupert-murdoch-trump-kushner-family\"><em>Vanity Fair</em></a> earlier this year. McKay wondered what Kushner’s family might think of <em>that</em> project of his, telling us, “Would they watch it and be like, ‘Oh cool, it’s us.’ Or would they watch it and be like, ‘Those sons of bitches, how dare they?’ My guess is they don’t watch it. I would love to hear a reaction from one of these families.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/58b09b14fd2e6133ee000003.js?muted=1\"></div></div><h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Don’t call it a Dernaissance, call it <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/laura-dern-cover-story?inline\">Laura Dern’s much-deserved close-up</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Ethan Hawke gets candid about the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/ethan-hawke-kevin-spacey-harvey-weinstein-little-gold-men-interview?inline\">Weinsteins and Spaceys of the world</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; “I have a little bit of control over my destiny” <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/nicole-kidman-destroyer-big-little-lies?inline\">&#8212;Nicole Kidman</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Harrowing tales from the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/st-barths-yacht-season-pippa-middleton-jared-leto-les-moonves?inline\">St. Barth’s Yacht Convention</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The year ahead in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/the-year-ahead-in-royals-2019?inline\">British royalty</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hollywood newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"HOLIDAY VACATION","socialTitle":"The Mystery of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s Movie Date","socialDescription":"The D.C. power couple took in Adam McKay’s political biopic Vice over the holidays.","seoTitle":"Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s Mystery Movie Date","seoDescription":"Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner—along with their Secret Service detail—took in a surprising choice of movie over their holiday break.","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Award Season","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":[],"revisionAuthor":"Anna  Raya","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"interactiveOverride":"","id":"5c37cdf69565e41ee72418b6","revision":47,"createdAt":"January 10, 2019 5:57 pm","modifiedAt":"January 10, 2019 9:32 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 10, 2019 9:32 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Hollywood","slug":"hollywood","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fae03af0739cf33e0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Award Season","slug":"award-season","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120b4f5c10202b9717a","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Movies","slug":"movies","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120c639a3587939aa6b","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Julie Miller is a Senior Hollywood writer for <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s website.

He <a href=\"http://www.saveourschoolsnj.org/2017/12/19/save-our-school-nj-cautiously-looks-forward-to-a-post-chris-christie-new-jersey/\">gutted</a> public-school funding and regularly <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/christie-defends-berating-constituent-for-asking-if-he-sends-his-kids-to-private-school-4664c752b3ad/\">brawled with constituents</a>. He closed state beaches on Fourth of July weekend, only to be caught lounging on one <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/03/535335917/chris-christie-closed-new-jersey-s-beaches-and-then-went-to-the-beach\">without a care in the world</a>. Then, of course, there was “<a href=\"https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/columnists/charles-stile/2018/11/28/bridgegate-scandal-closure-not-coming-soon-guilty-pair-chris-christie/2126842002/\">Bridgegate</a>,” an act of petty retribution the governor supposedly knew nothing about, despite the fact that it sounded <em>exactly</em> like something he would do. Unsurprisingly, Christie left office <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-chris-christie-became-least-popular-governor-in-new-jersey-history-2018-1\">with a 14 percent approval rating</a>. But there’s nothing like an exponentially worse politician to rehab one’s image by comparison, a dynamic the former governor has really leaned into over the past month!</p>\n<p>Yukking it up at a party to celebrate the release of his memoir, <em>Let Me Finish,</em> at the 9,000-square-foot penthouse of hedge-fund manager <strong>Steve Cohen</strong>&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.6sqft.com/billionaires-midtown-penthouse-got-the-biggest-price-chop-in-nyc-history-now-70m-off/\">which could be yours for the severely discounted price of $45 million</a>&#8212;Christie <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-13/christie-handicaps-the-field-of-democratic-presidential-hopefuls\">reportedly</a> regaled the crowd with his takes on the 2020 field. On <strong>Kamala Harris:</strong> “She’s articulate and she presents herself pretty well, O.K. So she’s got some advantages.” <strong>Cory Booker</strong>? “Everybody’s going to listen to that first speech and go, ‘I love him.’ Will they love him for the second speech, third speech, and fourth speech, and is there a second speech, third speech, and fourth speech?” <strong>Joe Biden</strong>? Apparently it comes down to if he comes off as “the adult in the room” or “crazy Uncle Joe . . . saying wacky stuff.” <strong>Amy Klobuchar</strong>? Christie, who dropped out of the Republican primary after winning just 7 percent of the vote in New Hampshire, thinks this business about her <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/amy-klobuchar-you-bet-your-ass-im-a-tough-boss\">reportedly</a> being awful to her staff will be tough to overcome. Christie, who claims he was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jared-kushner-chris-christie-book\">kicked off the White House transition team</a> by <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> also made a point of enumerating all the jobs <strong>Donald Trump</strong> <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/chris-christie-donald-trump-white-house-discussion-a8e00121-f094-4197-a62c-53d4cbcba20e.html\">supposedly offered him</a>: “Secretary of labor, twice. Secretary of homeland security, twice. Ambassador to Rome. Ambassador to the Vatican. And special assistant to the president.”</p>\n<p>Cohen’s Midtown duplex was a fitting pit stop on Christie’s current rehabilitation tour, given their long, mutualistic relationship. When Cohen’s hedge fund S.A.C. Capital Advisors <a href=\"https://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/11/chris_christie_invited_embattled_hedge-fund_billionare_steve_cohen_to_victory_party_report_says.html\">pleaded guilty to insider trading</a>, Christie <a href=\"https://dealbreaker.com/2013/11/chris-christie-and-steve-cohen-had-a-little-chat\">bucked Cohen up</a> the very next day with an invite to his re-election party and a private dinner. (Cohen himself was never charged.) Later, in 2015, Cohen <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/22/steven-cohen-pledges-250000-to-pro-christie-super-pac/\">wrote sizable checks to a pro-Christie super-PAC back when the governor had his eye on the White House</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/cfc76f84-a44f-4420-b825-6b55c781fab4?customColor=%23ff0000\"><iframe height=\"250\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/cfc76f84-a44f-4420-b825-6b55c781fab4?customColor=%23ff0000\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong><em>iTunes user?

In <em>Let Me Finish,</em> Christie <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/jared-kushner-chris-christie-book\">claims</a> that Jared got him fired from Trump’s transition as revenge for prosecuting his father over a decade earlier. Jared, it seems, argued that the then-U.S. attorney general should have minded his own business when it came to Charles’s decision to hire a prostitute to seduce his sister’s husband&#8212;who was cooperating with the feds at the time&#8212;tape the encounter, and send the tape to his sister. According to Christie, Jared insisted such things were “family matter[s], matter[s] to be handled by the family or the rabbis,” an argument he has somehow made <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/57891/index1.html\">on more than one occasion</a>!</p>\n<p>Whether throwing Trump and Jared under the bus will be enough to refurbish Christie in the public eye remains to be seen. On the plus side, several of the president’s stooges and lackeys who have <a

Khashoggi, and <strong>Donald Trump</strong> shrugged it off. Sure, U.S. intelligence agencies <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html\">concluded</a> that Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman</strong> had ordered the hit (which Saudi Arabia denied), and yes, lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/04/graham-senate-rebuke-saudi-arabia-1041379\">offered</a> some vocal criticism of the regime, but all in all, things worked out pretty well for M.B.S., who received neither punishment nor condemnation from the White House over the grisly dismemberment of a <em>Washington Post</em> columnist and U.S. resident. And yet, according to <em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-crown-prince-pivots-to-asia-from-critical-west-11550249887\">the young prince is pissed</a>!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Saudi Arabia’s crown prince is embarking on a five-country sweep through Asia to nurture alliances there as the murder of a Saudi dissident and the Saudi-led war in Yemen continue to disrupt the kingdom’s relations with the U.S. and European powers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Angered by Western criticism, Prince Mohammed Bin Salman has told aides that he would seek diplomatic support from Asian powers including China and India, according to senior Saudi government advisers. . . . The tour includes stops in China and India&#8212;for whom a stronger relationship with the heir to the Saudi throne could help secure energy resources for their expanding economies&#8212;along with Malaysia, Indonesia, and Pakistan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to reporters <strong>Jared Malsin</strong> and <strong>Summer Said,</strong> bin Salman “will likely receive a warmer reception on his Asia tour, as he focuses on trade and relations” with governments that are unlikely to raise pesky, downright offensive objections to Saudi Arabia’s less-than-stellar human-rights record. (In addition to the Khashoggi killing and Yemen, Human Rights Watch estimated last year that the Kingdom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/26/saudi-arabia-criticised-over-executions-for-drug-offences\">executed</a> 48 people in the first four months of 2018 alone, many for nonviolent offenses.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The tour is set to begin on Sunday in Pakistan, where the crown prince is bringing the promise of billions of dollars in support to an ally facing an economic crisis. Prince Mohammed is expected to sign at least $12 billion in agreements, including plans for a new oil refinery, investments in renewable energy, and an umbrella agreement to invest in the mining sector. He is also expected to approve an agreement to supply $3 billion in oil on a deferred payment basis. . . . In China, Prince Mohammed will meet the leaders of a country that is an important customer for oil and gas exports&#8212;Saudi Arabia is China’s largest supplier of crude. Beijing is itself investing in infrastructure and trade to extend its influence throughout Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While M.B.S. may indeed be feeling sensitive about the U.S., whose outrage over Khashoggi he <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-prince-salman-reportedly-confused-khashoggi-outrage-report-2018-10\">reportedly</a> couldn’t comprehend, there may still be an opportunity to patch things up. <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/world/middleeast/saudi-mbs-jared-kushner.html\">special friend in the White House</a>, will shortly embark on a tour of the Middle East that will include <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/07/kushner-mideast-peace-plan-1157710\">a pit stop in Saudi Arabia</a>. Said pit stop will presumably entail an intimate dinner in which the First Son-in-Law will assure the prince that everyone in Washington has his back, and that together, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-killing-saudi-arabia.html\">they’ll get through this</a>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Some people are taking the Amazon news better than others</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/mrkorangy/status/1096434850607910914\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrkorangy/status/1096434850607910914\">https://twitter.com/mrkorangy/status/1096434850607910914</a></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>On second thought, Deutsche Bank won’t go through with its pledge to help distressed homeowners</strong></p>\n<p>Back in late 2016, as part of a $7.2 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over crappy mortgage bonds it sold in the lead-up to the financial crisis, Deutsche Bank promised to spend $4 billion on consumer relief. Specifically, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-deutsche-bank-mueller-2017-12\">the president’s favorite bank</a> said it would help people who were at risk of defaulting on their mortgage payments, locked into extremely high interest rates, or owed more money on their mortgage than the value of their home. Now, Deutsche has taken some time to think that pledge over and has decided <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-15/deutsche-bank-reverses-pledge-to-help-distressed-homeowners\">not to go through with it at all</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deutsche Bank AG has decided that none of the more than $4 billion it promised to spend on consumer relief after the global mortgage crisis will go to distressed U.S. homeowners, according to a report by the monitor of the 2017 settlement. Instead, the consumer-relief money will be spent on originating new loans, according to the February 13 report by the bank’s monitor, <strong>Michael Bresnick.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The change in plans “may disappoint distressed homeowners and others, including the many individuals who have reached out to the monitor over the past two years, hoping to receive different types of consumer relief from the bank,” Bresnick wrote in the report, which was posted online.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The report did not go on to say “sorry, but them’s the breaks,” though clearly that‘s what is trying to be expressed here. In a statement, Deutsche said “As reported by the monitor, we have decided to focus our efforts on helping people purchase homes as the most efficient and effective way of delivering consumer relief given current market conditions and our financing expertise.”</p>\n<p><strong>How are the U.S. trade talks going with China?</strong></p>\n<p>If you ask White House National Economic Council director <strong>Larry Kudlow,</strong> they’re a regular night at Studio 54. “They’re covering all the ground. They’re hard at it. They’re just soldiering on. The vibe is good,” Kudlow <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2186292/us-china-trade-talks-good-vibes-and-laughter-venue-rivals-work\">told</a> reporters on Thursday. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/business/trump-china-us-trade.html\">On the other hand</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>. . . significant differences remain in the trade talks, and it is unclear whether they can be resolved, people briefed on the negotiations said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The most difficult and intractable issue involves the Trump administration’s desire to put meaningful restrictions on China’s ability to keep investing enormous sums of money from the government, and from government-affiliated financial institutions, in a wide range of advanced manufacturing sectors that compete with American industries. These include areas like commercial aircraft manufacturing, semiconductors, and artificial intelligence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Earlier this week, Trump said he might let the March 2 deadline, at which point tariffs on Chinese goods will increase from 10 to 25 percent, “slide for a little while” if progress was being made. He’s presumably stuck between wanting to please Wall Street&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/trump-admits-his-incredible-deal-with-china-is-bullshit\">as he has done in the past with bold, easily debunked lies</a>&#8212;and dragging out the drama for the next two weeks like the economy is a contestant on <em>The Apprentice.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>Trump’s “National Emergency” Speech Was a Rambling Mess (<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-national-emergency-declaration-wall\">The Hive</a></p>\n<p><strong>Eric Trump</strong> Blames Democrats for Ruining His Plans to Profit Off the Presidency (<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/eric-trump-blames-democrats-for-ruining-his-plans\">The Hive</a>)</p>\n<p>The Federal Debt Is Rising.

ahead, the musician reflects on the beauty-blogger phenomenon, her Gucci perfume campaign, and why disposable culture has her chasing that “forever feel.”","body":"<p>When has Los Angeles lore not been in fashion? As the Chateau Marmont earns its nonagenarian stripes this month, that “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/secrets-of-the-chateau-marmont\">high-thread-count clubhouse</a>” lives on as the nexus of Hollywood’s foibles and fascinations. In 2011, when the ingenue <strong>Lana Del Rey</strong> released the single “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE6wxDqdOV0\">Video Games</a>,” the music video shimmered with vintage footage of the property. Years later, Gucci’s <strong>Alessandro Michele</strong> took his own deep dive into Marmont memorabilia, turning out logo-embossed satchels and reimagined laundry bags for his Cruise 2019 collection. “It’s possible that no hotel in America inspires so much nostalgia, speculation, and sheer devotion,” writes <strong>Mark Rozzo</strong> in the 2019 Hollywood Issue of <em>Vanity Fair.</em> It’s not a surprise that Del Rey and Michele are fans.</p>\n<p>This time, the musician and the designer are coming together for a different kind of rewind&#8212;back to an era of body-hugging jumpsuits and sparkling laundromats, hairspray and patchouli-tinged perfume&#8212;to launch the campaign for <a href=\"https://www.macys.com/shop/product/gucci-guilty-pour-femme-eau-de-parfum-3.3-oz.?ID=7996939\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gucci Guilty</a>. Del Rey, the face of the his-and-hers fragrance alongside <strong>Jared Leto,</strong> recalls meeting Michele early into his Gucci tenure. “He told me that he had been putting together a lot of his collections while listening to my music,” she says in a call from rainy Los Angeles. “Needless to say, I was definitely flattered!”</p>\n<p>The campaign has a big-screen flair, with locations ranging from a classic diner to a nondescript supermarket (a roaming ostrich notwithstanding). The glamour&#8212;like the hair, styled by <strong>Paul Hanlon</strong>&#8212;is dialed way, way up. “We hadn’t really been thinking about nostalgia but just something that had a forever feel,” she says, likening the shoot to her recent Super 8-style music videos. “If you can mix that sensibility with a modern one”&#8212;Gucci’s mission in a nutshell&#8212;“you know you’re doing it right.”</p>\n<p>Here, Del Rey, whose sixth album, <em>Norman Fucking Rockwell,</em> is out later this year, unpacks that loaded title, laughs about the slow-dance lesson with a teenage crush, and talks up her version of self-care.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Vanity Fair:</em> The title of your new album brings to mind a certain classic vision of America. What was your headspace like for this record?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Lana Del Rey:</em> It was weird how that actual title came to me. I was riffing over a couple of chords that <strong>Jack [Antonoff]</strong> was playing for the title track, which ended up being called “Norman Fucking Rockwell.” It was kind of an exclamation mark: so this is the American dream, right now. This is where we’re at&#8212;Norman fucking Rockwell. We’re going to go to Mars, and <strong>[Donald] Trump</strong> is president, all right. Me and Jack, we just joke around constantly about all the random headlines we might see that week, so it’s a slight cultural reference. But it’s not a cynical thing, really. To me, it’s hopeful, to see everything as a little bit funnier. The chaos of the culture is interesting, and I’m hopeful that there’s room for there to be some movement and excitement within it.</p>\n<p><strong>There’s a line in “Video Games” about “[putting] his favorite perfume on”&#8212;a reminder that scent is as much a public performance as a private gesture. Do you have a relationship to it?</strong></p>\n<p>I love fragrance. I was always hesitant about being a crossover person, like a singer-slash-whatever. But if I had had less reservations, I [might have created] my own fragrance before I became the face of one. I didn’t want to do it in a big way&#8212;just for my own fans to enjoy. But I really do like fragrance. Being in L.A., you can tell the change of seasons depending on what flowers you can smell in the air. And I like the pink pepper and the peach [in Gucci Guilty]&#8212;very light, but a little spicy, which I think makes it easier to wear every day. In that way, it kind of reminds me of something I would have liked when I was a little bit younger. When I was in middle school, me and [my] cousins would go down to Bath &amp; Body Works and get an apple perfume, with one note, or a vanilla roller. It was thrilling. I still like a one-note perfume. Even if I’m putting on a Hawaiian Tropic suntan lotion, I like the smell of a little coconut. Or a rosewater spray.</p>\n<p><strong>Was there chemistry between you and Jared Leto, as subjects in this strange fantasy world in the Gucci campaign?</strong></p>\n<p>We work pretty differently. He’s been acting for so long that it’s very easy for him to just come in and off the set, but I like to hang out with the crew and Alessandro and see if they were shooting an ostrich [laughs]. So no, I didn’t get to pretend that I was with my old crush from <em>My So-Called Life</em>&#8212;although I did have one moment where we were supposed to be slow-dancing in the laundromat. I freaked out because I forgot how to do that for some reason. He was really nice and taught me how to dance again, so that was our most couple-ish moment.</p>\n<p><strong>The old-school hair salon appears in so many classic movie scenes. Did it bring up certain associations for you?</strong></p>\n<p>I spent years putting my hair into wet sets, so I’ve sat under those giant hoods myself. I’m sure I loved them at one point, but I just hate them now! I’d put my hair into rollers, dry them into curls, and then brush them out, so it was like a big Texas triangle. I would do that like every four days, if I was playing shows or for little appearances. Now I put it into braids and hope for the best!</p>\n<p><strong>Those curl sets were all about glamour. What do you make of the beauty upkeep of the Instagram age? Is there a kinship with midcentury perfectionism?</strong></p>\n<p>Totally. I find myself on random beauty-blogger pages, and I have no idea how I got there, watching a cat eye. All of the girls with those perfect pictures&#8212;you know, I don’t hate it. I totally see the connection between that old 50s Hollywood glamour and whatever you want to call what’s going on now. There’s definitely a modern, heightened take.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you imagine yourself playing a character while you were shooting the campaign?</strong></p>\n<p>I was stressing a little bit because I was hopping out of my Lululemon leggings and Ugg boots and getting into my jumpsuit&#8212;and getting into a lot of hair, a lot of makeup, which I love doing. But I feel like my at-home weirdness is very normal-looking, so it was almost uncomfortable to be outwardly in diamonds at the grocery store! But that was the point: wouldn’t it be funny if these two people just lived every day like this? I told [Alessandro] that’s how everyone in L.A. is. They’re at Erewhon with their diamonds on.</p>\n<p><strong>Just the title of the song “Venice Bitch” calls to mind a juice-drinking Erewhon habitué. Do you eye-roll at L.A.’s wellness scene, or are you into it?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh, yeah&#8212;I’m that girl. I’m at Erewhon; I’m in yoga classes. I love L.A. for that reason. I’m so lucky that when Jack or <strong>Rick [Nowels]</strong> are in town, I get to work, but it’s such a blessing for me to be able to run down the street somewhere on La Brea and go to the DEN Meditation or do a spin class. You could literally go on every corner and find some type of deep-breathwork class. I do all that stuff, so yeah: Venice bitch [laughs].</p>\n<p><strong>What do you consider your main form of self-care?</strong></p>\n<p>I could sum it up in one word: girlfriends. I see my friends every day; I’m in coffee shops for hours talking to them. It’s just pretty simple&#8212;not isolating and planning little things. For me, because I’m a really sensitive person, surrounding myself with a gentle personality type&#8212;which is the rarer type&#8212;that’s my biggest form of self-care. And the rest kind of falls into place.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The dirty truth about <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/the-dirty-secret-of-el-chapo-downfall?inline\">El Chapo’s downfall</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; That time <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/brian-rea-modern-love-death-wins-a-goldfish?inline\">death took a break</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The 25 <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/25-best-movie-scenes?inline\">most influential movie scenes</a> of the past 25 years</p>\n<p>&#8212; Acupuncture and hypno-birthing?

national-security secrets.","promoDek":"Jared Kushner isn’t the only Trump official who got a special pass after security experts said he shouldn’t be allowed to access national-security secrets.","body":"<p>In May, after months working under an interim clearance, <strong>Jared Kushner’s</strong> request for a permanent security clearance, which would allow him to see top-secret material, was finally granted. At the time, observers took this as an indication that <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> son-in-law, who’d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jared-kushner-now-a-focus-in-russia-investigation/2017/05/25/f078db74-40c7-11e7-8c25-44d09ff5a4a8_story.html\">reportedly</a> attracted <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> attention for his ties to various foreign entities, was in the clear. On Thursday, however, an NBC News <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/officials-rejected-jared-kushner-top-secret-security-clearance-were-overruled-n962221\">report</a> threw that conclusion into doubt. In fact, two sources familiar with the matter told the outlet, Kushner’s clearance was only approved because Trump’s handpicked director of security personnel overruled two career White House security specialists, who had recommended against Kushner receiving top-secret clearance after seeing the results of his F.B.I. background check.</p>\n<p>Kushner’s case represents a worrisome pattern for the White House. Per NBC, Trump’s director of security, <strong>Carl Kline,</strong> overruled security experts in at least 30 cases, recommending that Trump officials be granted clearances despite troubling information uncovered in their background checks. (The sources noted that the Trump White House “attracted many people with untraditional backgrounds who had complicated financial and personal histories, some of which raised red flags.”) That number is indeed extraordinary. Prior to the Trump administration, White House security experts had only been overruled <em>once</em> in the past three years. (The White House told NBC, “We don’t comment on security clearances.” A C.I.A. spokesman said the same, and Kushner’s lawyer, <strong>Abbe Lowell,</strong> had “no comment.” Kline, a former Pentagon employee, could not be reached for comment.)</p>\n<p>Denying a security clearance to a White House official, noted <strong>Daniel Jacobson,</strong> a former lawyer in <strong>Barack Obama’s</strong> administration, is not something that’s done lightly. “It is not normal for the head of the Personal Security Office to ever overrule the career employees who adjudicate clearances,” he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dan_F_Jacobson/status/1088614823859023872\">wrote</a> on Twitter. “It takes some pretty bad stuff to be denied a clearance. The fact that there have been thirty denial recommendations of WH staff in the last 1.5 years is itself crazy, before you even get to the overruling part.”</p>\n<p>After he was cleared by the White House, Kushner’s file was reportedly submitted to the C.I.A. to be evaluated for an S.C.I., or “sensitive compartmented information” clearance&#8212;an even higher designation. It didn’t go well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After reviewing the file, C.I.A. officers who make clearance decisions balked, two of the people familiar with the matter said. One called over to the White House security division, wondering how Kushner got even a top-secret clearance, the sources said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given his various entanglements, the C.I.A.’s alarm makes sense. As <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/kushners-overseas-contacts-raise-concerns-as-foreign-officials-seek-leverage/2018/02/27/16bbc052-18c3-11e8-942d-16a950029788_story.html\">reported last year</a>, the president’s son-in-law is viewed by several foreign countries&#8212;the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, China, and Israel among them&#8212;as a potentially manipulable asset, given his fraught business dealings and his notable lack of political experience. Along with his communications with Russia during the transition, which <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/jared-kushner-russia-investigation-robert-mueller-mike-flynn-cnn-1246401\">caught Mueller’s attention</a>, Kushner helped <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90233994/how-a-secret-seychelles-meeting-signaled-the-uae-pull-in-trump-d-c\">establish a back channel</a> with the U.A.E. while <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/03/02/jared-kushner-real-estate-qatar-blockade/\">supporting a blockade against Qatar</a>, and has maintained a close personal friendship with Saudi Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/saudi-arabia-united-arab-emirates-jared-kushner-robert-mueller\">reportedly bragged</a> last spring that he had Kushner “in his pocket” after Kushner allegedly turned over a list of Saudi dissidents being monitored by the U.S. (Kushner’s team has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/russia-isnt-the-only-country-with-its-hooks-in-jared-kushner\">called</a> this allegation “obviously false and ridiculous”; shortly after the gruesome death of Jamal Khashoggi, Kushner apparently became a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/world/middleeast/saudi-mbs-jared-kushner.html\">reliable defender of the crown prince</a> within the White House.)</p>\n<p>Presumably, some or all of these dealings factored into career officials’ recommendation that Kushner be denied a security clearance. “They would not do that lightly for someone of Kushner’s stature and position,” Jacobson wrote. “The fact that the C.I.A. then denied his S.C.I. application is equally damning,” he added. “And the fact that they were so disturbed by the granting of his [top secret] clearance that they called over to the WH? Hooboy.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The family drama surrounding <a
