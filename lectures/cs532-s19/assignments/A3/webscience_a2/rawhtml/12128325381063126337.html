Bush.</p>

Ms. Hicks, a longtime aide and confidant, took over communications after Mr. Scaramucci’s disastrous tenure.

          <p>An earlier version of a graphic with this article incorrectly stated that David J. Shulkin was replaced by Dr. Ronny L. Jackson. He was expected to be replaced by Dr. Jackson, then the White House physician, but Dr. Jackson withdrew as nominee. Mr. Shulkin was permanently replaced by Robert L. Wilkie.</p>
