On Tuesday, Aaron McGruder shared a bunch of new The Boondocks comics. Posted by radio host Charlamagne tha God, they're the first new strip-style cartoons from McGruder since the cartoon's newspaper run ended in 2006. The Boondocks was subsequently adapted into a series at Cartoon Network, where it ran for four seasons.

In a message posted by Charlamagne, McGruder said the new strips were completed "for fun (and to see I still could." The comics were co-created with Seung Kim, an animator on The Boondocks TV series, and McGruder promises more comics are on the way, though "exactly how much more is tough to say." McGruder also thanks Charlamagne "for putting these out for me while I get my Instagram act together.”
The new comics take place in the present day, a time of unprecedented political upheaval that seems perfect for McGruder's take. The characters are just as you remember them, only better suited for the times: black racist Uncle Ruckus has ridden the wave of white nationalism into political office (and got the attention of Robert Mueller in the process), Granddad is an oblivious hypocrite in the times of #MuteRKelly, and Huey and Riley are still bickering as ever. Saturday Night Live may have drained your will to consume Trump-era satire, but these new strips show it's possible to bite back if you truly take no prisoners.
