Donald Trump tells MSPs: 'I am the evidence'
A Holyrood inquiry has warned the Scottish government's ambitious green energy targets are at risk because companies are struggling to get finance.
The report by Scottish Parliament's economy committee also said the planning system and investment in industry skills needed looking at.
During its inquiry the committee heard from supporters and opponents of wind farm developments in Scotland including billionaire property developer Donald Trump.
Mr Trump told MSPs: "I am the evidence", when asked for information to back his claims that wind power will damage Scotland's tourism industry.
