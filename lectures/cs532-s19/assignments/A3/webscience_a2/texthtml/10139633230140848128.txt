New York State Governor Cuomo ordered the One World Trade Center lit in pink and the legislature there gave him a standing ovation for supporting late term abortions. THEY GAVE A STANDING O FOR INFANTICIDE PEOPLE>
In Vermont they couldn’t wait to pass the same thing supporting late term abortions.
Then the Governor of Virginia Ralph Northam comes out for infanticide. He gets called on it and given a chance to back off his remarks. Then he doubles down on his remarks. Are the Democrats upset. No but they are trying to run him out of office for a racist photo from college.
 
There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days.  Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth.  These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world.  And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb.
Trump powerfully says: “Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.  And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:  all children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God.”
Never been prouder of a President of the United States. The Democrats are sick and he pointed out their depravity.
