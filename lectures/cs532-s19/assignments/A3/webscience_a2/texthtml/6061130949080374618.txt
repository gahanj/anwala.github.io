In an interview with CBS's "60 Minutes" aired Sunday, Trump said the issue has "been settled," adding that how he personally feels about gay marriage is irrelevant. 
"It's law. It was settled in the Supreme Court," Trump said.
"It's done. ... These cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They've been settled, and I'm fine with that." 
Trump has, in recent months, painted himself as a "friend" of the LGBTQ community, though he once considered appointing Supreme Court justices that would overturn the ruling. 
But his latest stance on the issue is at odds with the GOP's official platform .
Passed during the summer, the platform strongly supports "traditional marriage" and condemned the Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. It's also a position that strikes contrast between himself and his vice president, Mike Pence
"Five unelected lawyers robbed 320 million Americans of their legitimate constitutional authority to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman," the platform reads. 
"We, therefore, support the appointment of justices and judges who respect the constitutional limits on their power and respect the authority of the states to decide such fundamental social questions."
