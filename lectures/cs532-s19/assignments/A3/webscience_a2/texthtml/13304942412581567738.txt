Russia
Warns Explosive Trump Fury To Be Unleashed Against Democrat Party In April-May Bloodbath

The critical issue surrounding BuzzFeed obtaining the Trump-Russia Dossier, this report explains, is that it was a highly classified document the FBI used to illegally obtain a spying warrant against the Trump campaign during the 2016 US presidential electionand that former disgraced FBI Director James Comey admitted under oath had never been verified, either before or after this illegal spying warrant had been obtained .
 
 
Where ordinary citizens would think that Trump loyalist forces would have arrested Deep State operative Natalie Edwards long before allowing her to remain in her sensitive government job for nearly 2-years, this report further explains, counterintelligence protocols used by both the SVR and US intelligence agencies call for keeping operatives like her under continuous surveillance so as to discover other operatives working in the same spy networkthus making it fully explainable as to why Assistant US Attorney Kimberly Ravener appeared in US Federal Court this past Wednesday to confront Edwards and warn of further charges to filed against her, and cryptically state that Edwards co-conspirators could expect criminal charges against them, too .
