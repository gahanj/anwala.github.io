The beginning of February means Carnival (from the Italian ‘carne vale’ or ‘say goodbye to meat’) in most Western European countries as the celebrations for the countdown towards Easter officially begin.
In Italy, more specifically in the city of Viareggio they pull out all the stops and feature giant statues of famous politicians and celebrities.

For this reason, one of the Carnival groups has created a giant ‘Trump Warrior’ complete with Twitter sword.
Commenters already proposed that he should take on London’s ‘Baby Trump’ balloon.
