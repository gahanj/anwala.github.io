Ivanka Trump’s a feminist? Yep – just like her father and her brothers | Catherine Bennett
America’s first family are outraged by an art work that presumes to shows her vacuuming
In a singular achievement for US conceptual art, an installation by Jennifer Rubell has prompted three – to date – of Donald Trump’s children to disclose their horror of sexism.
The piece in question , Ivanka Vacuuming, recently opened in Washington DC. A video shows a woman in the Trump-preferred genre – young, high-heeled, blond – impassively pushing a vacuum cleaner around a pink carpet, on to which visitors are invited to throw crumbs, from a generous pile on a pedestal. “Inspired by a figure whose public persona incorporates an almost comically wide range of feminine identities – daughter, wife, mother, sister, model, working woman, blond– Ivanka Vacuuming is,” say the organisers, CulturalDC, “simultaneously a visual celebration of a contemporary icon; a portrait of our own relationship to that figure; and a questioning of our complicity in her role playing.”
