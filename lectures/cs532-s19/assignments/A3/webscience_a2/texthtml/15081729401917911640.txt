Obama is 8th, with Lincoln, Washington and Franklin Roosevelt holding the top three spots. The same experts ranked Buchanan last and Obama 18th in 2014.
Notable movements: Clinton slid from 8th to 13th and Jackson from 9th to 15th, "arguably the result of contemporary scorn for [Clinton's] treatment of women, and for evolving attitudes on [Jackson's] treatment of Native Americans," per the Times. George W. Bush moved from 35th up to 30th.
