Prior to becoming President, Trump whilst building his golf courses in Scotland Trump defrauded numerous contractors in the building of his golf courses leaving multiple small businesses in debt and having to foreclose!!!
He tasked his son Donald Jnr to devalue the value of properties of residents living within the vicinity of his golf courses and he did this publicly!!!!
At his Turnberry golf course, part of the purchase agreement was that local residents were to be able to access the beach. He then signed the agreement and purchased the land, then proceeded to fence the beach off to local residents!!!
He bullied and publicly shamed pensioners (that had lived there all their lives) who weren’t willing to sell their land for the reduced value he was offering!
He then had the cheek to campaign with his team of heavies to eliminate clean renewable energy on Scottish Coastlines because he felt wind power looked unsightly!
Scottish protest photos from 2012
He calls the Scottish “Scotch” despite claiming Scottish heritage, wanna piss off a Scotsman guess what you call him?
He then in a Speech applauded the Scottish for Brexit, the Scottish overwhelmingly voted against Brexit!
The Paris accord was a historic moment, the first time in history that the world agreed that climate change was a real problem and we should unite in efforts to reduce emissions. Trump pulled out thus acknowledging no responsibility as one of the worlds biggest polluters and destroyed his own Environmental Protection Agency by employing the head of it to be an oil Barron and climate change denialist!
In his attempt to eliminate Obamacare he denigrated the British NHS as a failure, whilst you won’t find a single Brit who agrees with him as the NHS is a national treasure.
In both the London Bridge attacks and Manchester bombing instead of offering sympathy he decided to tweet anti Islamic sentiment!
London has a Mayor who’s the most popular mayor since the position began and also happens to be a moderate Muslim, so when London experienced the tragedy of the Grenfell fire, whilst Britain came together in grief, Trump decided to attack the Mayor of London for his religion.
He then decided to endorse the views of fringe racist group "Britain First". If you don’t know, Britain First are a divisive, racist organisation that spread Neo Nazi propaganda and are condemned by the vast majority of Brits. The British government then condemned Trump for this only for Trump to then tweet condescending remarks about the British!!!!
He’s used an example of recent knife crime in London to bolster the pro gun agenda in his latest speech to the NRA, whilst ignoring the huge gun problem in the US and after lying to the victims of the Florida school shooting by promising tighter gun control…
He exaggerates the violence in the U.K. saying our hospitals are blood splattered and wards full of victims of knife crime.
He’s pulled out of the Iran deal which threatens a peaceful nuclear solution!
He’s given legitimacy to a North Korean dictator whilst weakening the South (An American ally)!
He is shortly due to visit Britain and take my word for it, he’s truly not welcome by the British public! He had worn out his welcome by 2005. He criticises other politicians for things he does himself and to excess and takes credit for the success of others! He’s a known fraudster in his business dealings such as Trump University! And he seems hellbent on destroying alliances with allied countries whilst cozying up to tyrannical dictators!!!!!
And these are just the ones that I can think of from the top of my head!
But really, need I say more?
The man is a disastrous train wreck of a tyrant and shame on the idiots who voted for this walking colostomy bag!!!!If I ever meet a Trump voter I will indeed TRUMP in your general direction!!!!!!

A few things spring to mind.
Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem.
For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace - all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed.
So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump’s limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief.
Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing - not once, ever.
I don’t say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility - for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman.
But with Trump, it’s a fact. He doesn’t even seem to understand what a joke is - his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty.
Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers.
And scarily, he doesn’t just talk in crude, witless insults - he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness.
There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It’s all surface.
Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront.
Well, we don’t. We see it as having no inner world, no soul.
And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist.
Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that.
He’s not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat.
He’s more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege.
And worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully.
That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead.
There are unspoken rules to this stuff - the Queensberry rules of basic decency - and he breaks them all. He punches downwards - which a gentleman should, would, could never do - and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless - and he kicks them when they are down.
So the fact that a significant minority - perhaps a third - of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think 'Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy’ is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that:
Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and mostly are.
You don't need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man.
This last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss.
After all, it’s impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum.
God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid.
He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W look smart.
In fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws - he would make a Trump.
And a remorseful Doctor Frankenstein would clutch out big clumpfuls of hair and scream in anguish:
'My God… what… have… I… created?’
If being a twat was a TV show, Trump would be the boxed set.

Let’s ignore the first premise, because it simply isn’t true. The British are well known for being quite reserved and not speaking out when when things are very wrong. They’ll eat burned restaurant food and pay for it rather than complain.
On the second count, I can speak only for myself.
I used to look at Trump as a famous and wealthy businessman who had written a very famous book about how to become successful. Reports of his activities were infrequent in the UK, but most people still knew his name, something about his private life, Ivana, Ivanka, etc., and about his bankruptcies too - and that he somehow survived and ended up still “rich”.
The politics of Democrat vs Republican in the US is not generally well understood in the UK. The complexity of interaction between Presidency, Congress, Senate, Federal and State lawmaking, Judiciary - it’s all far more complicated than our Parliamentary system. Many people in the UK wouldn’t know whether a past POTUS was Democrat or Republican. In that sense, we’re pretty much ambivalent about the politics of the President, and it’s his actions and words as a person we see and make judgment upon.
When Trump ran for President, most people here had no opinion of him.
As his rallies intensified, and his rhetoric became more public, some of us were sympathetic to him when he was attacked for certain statements and behaviours. I heard a lot of argument for and against his ideas, behaviour, and presentation.
There came a point when, I recall, the attitude turned. He no longer got the benefit of the doubt, because what we’d thought were misinterpretations of his words and actions turned out to be the truth - because he cleared up the confusion by clearly re-stating the contentious things.
I started to look at his past behaviour, interviews, writings, and became aware that this man had done harm to a lot of people in the past, basically by being a hard-nosed bully. He even boasted of it. It’s not a personality type we like in the UK.
I started to listen to full versions of his campaign speeches, and frankly couldn’t find any real content. There was a lot of rabble-rousing invective like “Lock her up” and “Hillary is a crook” and “We’re gonna build a wall” and personal insults against everyone else involved in the race to the White House. There was no real substance, no philosophy of HOW America would be great again, just the boast that only Trump could make it that way. There was a LOT of personal aggrandisement. “Only I can…[insert any claim you like]” and “I’m the best at [insert any activity]” and “Many people [never named] say Donald Trump is a genius”.
In the UK, that kind of “political” speech making would make the man a laughing stock. The imitating of a disabled person would end his campaign within a day. The not-so-veiled calls to his supporters to resort to violence against detractors, likewise. He would probably have been questioned by the Police for incitement. We all watched, gobsmacked, as he not only got away with it, but USED it to publicise himself.
We already knew about his attitude in the golf club business in Scotland. We dislike that kind of “my money is more powerful than your argument” attitude. He made no attempt, not has he ever, to be NICE. He made hateful statements, repeated them, inflated them further, lied, made the lies bigger, pretended he never said things that he was on video saying in front of international cameras, and called the reporting of it “fake”. He still does.
What’s to like?
Trump doesn’t care what we think. He’s a sociopath.

Well, to answer that question in what I think is the appropriate spirit:
The British are not ‘infamous for saying what they think’. If they are infamous for anything, it’s snobbery and colonialism.
British and specifically English manners are to avoid saying what you think, so as not to offend the other person, but to more or less inadvertently offend the person anyway, by making it very clear what you think by means of various kinds of subtle and not-so-subtle non-verbal behaviour which the other person is at a loss to respond to. This is what the British have instead of martial arts.
The idea that the British are straight-talking no-nonsense types is unfamiliar to anyone who has spent time among them.
‘Saying what you think’ is not necessarily a virtue. In a statesman, it’s an absolute liability, unless the statesman actively wants his country to become less powerful and more vulnerable.
Donald Trump is not likeable by virtue of the fact that he says what he thinks, although much of the time he clearly does say what he thinks. The trouble is that when he does say what he thinks, it becomes clear that he doesn’t think very hard, and that the little that he thinks is generally stupid, uninformed, racist, sexist, bigoted, cruel, vindictive or some or all of the above.
Despite their many flaws, the British are on balance working pretty hard to be better citizens of the world—well, not of Europe, but everybody makes mistakes—and, as such, they have little patience with the generally tenth-rate nature of Donald Trump as both a politician and as a human.

Someone asked "Why do some British people not like Donald Trump?"
Nate White, an articulate and witty writer from England, wrote this magnificent response:
"A few things spring to mind.

Giving you the benefit of the doubt I have edited your question to replace “infamouos” with “famous” based on what Merriam Webster says.
“Yes, famous and infamous have some similarities (both words are descended from the Latin fama, meaning “fame,” and both often have to do with being well-known), but they have decidedly different meanings. Famous typically carries the meaning of “widely known,” and is often used in a positive manner; infamous, on the other hand, has a negative set of meanings, such as ‘having a reputation of the worst kind” or “causing or bringing infamy .’ “
I did not report your question on the off chance you sincerely want answers, don’t know the meaning of infamous, and are not just stirring up the pot. On the other hand you may actually mean infamous in which case your question is insincere and should be reported since it contains a statement of fact not in evidence (that the British are infamous in some way) and violates BNBR too for being disrespectful of the British.
I have British friends, some of whom I know well and have known for many years. They do say what they think, sometimes very bluntly, just like Donald Trump, but never in cheap, lying, insulting ways like Trump has done over and over. They don’t like Trump because of the vulgar ways he says what he says and because of the opinions he has which they disagree with vehemently and because to them he is an embarrasment to Americans. They can’t believe we elected such a clown to be our President.
The British are not infamous for saying what they think.
Even if they were, why would it be the case that they like others who say what they think?
“Saying what you think” is not necessarily a value, especially when not tempered by intelligence, wit, empathy, and/or a concern for the truth.
Donald Trump is not infamous for saying what he thinks. He’s infamous for being an unhinged reality TV star who says anything that pops into his head, without thought for consistency with previously uttered statements, the truth, or how those statements might affect others.
My experience with the British (I lived and worked there for several years) is that they refer to people who behave like this as c*nts. They do not take him seriously and wish he would go away. And btw, most Americans feel the same way — and the Brits I know are truly baffled by those who don’t.
“Being infamous for saying what they think, why do the British not like Donald Trump?”
For a start, the first part of the question is incorrect (if anything, it’s Americans that don’t seem to possess a filter before they speak), but if you think it needs answering then you haven’t been watching ANY news since before Trump took office. You’ve got a lot of reading to do on why he’s a total cunt.
Trump is almost universally hated in Britain as he utterly offends any sense of fair play and decency we have. He derides what he doesn’t understand. He spouts blatant lies that aren’t even difficult to debunk. He hates anything and anyone who doesn’t agree with his small-mindedness. He exhibits the same traits and controlling desires as people like Hitler, Stalin and most other autocrats. This point is non-debatable as he’s basically a dictator-in-waiting. He’s also absolutely detested in Scotland, home of his (utterly failing) golf course, and is ridiculed and caricatured endlessly due to his colossal buffoonery and dangerous ignorance.
A comedian over here in Scotland called Frankie Boyle once said “Trump will be the world’s first crowd-funded assassination” and, although he was making a joke, there’s a large part of me hopes it comes true as the world will be better off without him.
Leaving aside our undeserved reputation for straight talking (1), I’d have to say that the thing that bothers me most about President Trump isn’t the appalling policies, the suspicions of corruption, the bigotry and my worries about exactly how far his senility has gone.
No, rather it is that being British and a bit of a snob about these things I think he’s a crass, tasteless egotist. He is (as someone once said) a poor man’s idea of a rich man. I’d call him a parvenu, someone who came to money late in life and doesn’t know how to handle being well off except that his father was the one who made the family fortune not him and he grew up with wealth and privilege.
Which makes it all the more annoying that he thinks the epitome of style is plating everything with gold even the lavatory!
(1) A superior of mine in the Civil Service once complimented me for being particularly skilled at being formally polite and terribly insulting at the same time. I think I was complimented…
