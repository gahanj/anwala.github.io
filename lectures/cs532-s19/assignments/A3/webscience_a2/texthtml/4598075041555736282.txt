Washington (US) Feb 10 (ANI): Former New Jersey governor Chris Christies on Saturday said that former United States vice president Joe Biden has the best chance of beating President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.
“I think the one that the President would be most afraid of if he can stay in his lane is Biden. And the reason why Biden could go to Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Michigan and appeal to white working-class voters. And if he does that, he only has to peel off 7,000-10,000 votes in each one of those states, and he only has to win two of them,” said Christies during HBO's Real Time with Bill Mahar .
The Republican leader made these remarks while appearing on the HBO's Real Time with Bill Mahar show for the promotion of his recently launched book 'Let Me Speak'.
According to a poll surveying 689 Democratic and independent voters conducted by USA Today and Suffolk University, Obama-era vice president Biden, 76, is now the most popular option to be the next presidential candidate for the Democrats, as fifty-three per cent of voters said they felt excited about Biden running, while only seven per cent expressed the same enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton, reported Sputnik.
The former governor also heaped praise on the three-term independent senator Bernie Sanders by saying that Sanders has an outlook. "I think Bernie has a little bit of that. You know, Bernie doesn’t back down to anybody and when Bernie’s got a point of view, he’s gonna say it and he doesn’t really sugarcoat anything. So I think Sanders is one of those people,” he said.
However, Sanders has not yet announced a run for the White House, though he has said he will “probably run” for president in 2020.
When asked about President Trump's "not so good" presidency, the former governor said, "We had a lot of President in the history who had a questionable moral code." (ANI)
