Following the recent unveiling of the Democrats “Green New Deal,” President Trump took some time Saturday Evening to weigh in.
In what The Federalist called  “a tongue in cheek tweet the president encouraged Democrats to embrace Ocasio-Cortez’s insane idea.”
“I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal. It would be great for the so-called “Carbon Footprint” to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military – even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!” he said.

The tweet came shortly after a blistering mockery of Senator and now Official 2020 Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren.
“Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!” Trump Tweeted.

Trump’s tweet seemed to provide hope the all Democrats embrace the plan as both he and his team believe it is a seasoned pass to victory in 2020.
