No, not a chance in the world once all corruption is exposed in the democrat party, and seeing the latest reasons in VA where all three top democrats are now exposed for all to see how voters made a huge mistake with governors. Voters are going to wake up some day and realize voting party line is a big mistake, vote for the person first and foremost, and register as an independent to shake up this fixed and corrupt two party system. Northam had used a racist attack against his opponent, driving a pick up truck with Gillespie bumper sticker and rebel flag when Northam turns out to be the real racist. Hypocrites and liars, the party is over. RIP
