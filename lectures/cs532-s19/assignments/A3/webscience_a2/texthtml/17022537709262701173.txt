United States President Donald Trump, who was the target of criticism for his decision to withdraw US troops in Syria, has posted on social media about the US withdrawal. Arguing that the country was overrun by ISIS until he intervened, he added that the US army will completely destroy the Caliphate soon, but will continue to watch the situation closely:  ‘after 18 long years. Syria was loaded with ISIS until I came along. We will soon have destroyed 100% of the Caliphate, but will be watching them closely. It is now time to start coming home and, after many years, spending our money wisely. Certain people must get smart!’, Trump wrote on twitter.
Commenting on Twitter, Trump also criticized the previous policies of Afghanistan and Syria, recalling the war budgets that were spent on peace talks between the United States and the Taliban:
I inherited a total mess in Syria and Afghanistan, the “Endless Wars” of unlimited spending and death. During my campaign I said, very strongly, that these wars must finally end. We spend $50 Billion a year in Afghanistan and have hit them so hard that we are now talking peace.’
