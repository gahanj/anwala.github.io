Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Khomenei on Friday clarified that his country’s famous “death to America” chant calls for death to U.S. leaders like President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, not average American citizens, reports Newsweek .
Reuters reports that the Khamenei marked the 40th anniversary of Iran’s Islamic Revolution on Friday with a speech to military officials that called out top Trump administration officials
“As long as America continues its wickedness, the Iranian nation will not abandon ‘Death to America,’ ” Khamenei reportedly said. “ ‘Death to America’ means death to Trump, [National Security Adviser] John Bolton, and [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo. It means death to American rulers.”
In his speech Friday, Khamenei reportedly lashed out against European leaders, urging Iran not to “trust” Western nations remaining in the nuclear agreement after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 weapons pact.
“I recommend that one should not trust the Europeans just as the Americans,” Khamenei said. “We don’t say, don’t have contacts with them, but it’s an issue of trust.”
His comments follow a report last month detailing the country’s efforts to begin enrichment of uranium fuel, a move that would violate the terms of the agreement.
“Preliminary activities for designing modern 20 percent [enriched uranium] fuel have begun,” the country’s nuclear chief said last month. “We have made such progress in nuclear science and industry that, instead of reverse-engineering and the use of designs by others, we can design new fuel ourselves.”
