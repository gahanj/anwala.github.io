Unnamed U.S. officials  told  the Associated Press (AP) the Trump administration prefers sending the ISIS prisoners back to their  home  countries to be prosecuted.
“Repatriating foreign terrorist fighters to their countries of origin and ensuring they are prosecuted and detained is the best solution to prevent them from returning to the battlefield,” DOS declared in a statement, according to AP.
If the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) holding an estimated 1,000 suspected ISIS fighters cannot repatriate the prisoners, however, the State Department suggested sending them to Gitmo “where lawful and appropriate.”
“The Administration’s  National Strategy for Counterterrorism  makes very clear that Law of Armed Conflict detention, including at Guantanamo, remains an important and effective  counterterrorism  tool,” DOS explained.
An unnamed U.S. official reportedly stressed sending captured jihadis to Gitmo is the “option of last resort.”
AP learned from the U.S. official that the Trump administration has “identified about 50 people” held by the Syrian forces as “high value” suspects that could be transferred to Guantánamo if the SDF cannot repatriate them.
