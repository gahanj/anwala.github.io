Many failures to protect our children have recently been exposed in systems at Federal, State & Local levels, with awful news in athletics, entertainment, religious organizations, & elsewhere.  Only a Presidential Commission can bring everyone to work together.  The U.K. and Australia have taken steps to strengthen mandatory reporting requirements, eliminated the statute of limitations for child sex abuse, shielded the names of victims, & instituted tough mandatory sentences for these criminals.  America must act!  I funded the documentary An Open Secret to give thanks for a safe childhood.  Film has over 4,000,000 views free on Vimeo & we expose many examples, e.g. a manager raped his young acting client for years, pled guilty to 4 counts & served only 6 months in prison. Gabe Hoffman
