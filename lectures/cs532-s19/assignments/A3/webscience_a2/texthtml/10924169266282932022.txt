Trump isn’t sincere at all. He talks out of 2 sides of his mouth. He says only what people want to hear while planning his own agenda. He only cares about himself and what money he can scam out of the public out of to line his own pockets.
Just look at his Trump Charity or Trump University for Real Estate. Both scams to line his own pockets and his 3 stooges(Don, Jr, Eric, and Ivanka) who will do anything for Daddy’s love—-commit crimes like treason and lie for him.
Trump even scammed his business partners by not paying them for contracts he had for the work they did for him and told them to sue him. From way back when he worked with his daddy the committed fraud on taxes.
He got away with all his crimes because the companies that he owed money to didn’t have the money to sue him and he paid people off to cover his tracks. he thought he was untouchable but being president has flashed a bright light on all his crimes and now the states and federal government have means to go after him once he leaves office
