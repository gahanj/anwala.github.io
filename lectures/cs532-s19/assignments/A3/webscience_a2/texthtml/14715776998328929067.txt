Apparently there's no better way to follow up a State of the Union speech that attempts to unify the nation than with a Prayer Breakfast speech that alienates people who care about civil rights. 
President Donald Trump listed the nation's great accomplishments on Thursday, and accidentally included the "abolition of civil rights" as one of them. Clearly he meant the abolition of slavery, right? Late-night comic Stephen Colbert has a different take on Trump's verbal stumble. Take a look at today's Best of Late Night, above, to find out what that is. 
And Trump even tried to deport someone during the religious event. Or was it a something? Jimmy Fallon fills us in.
