Pennsylvania's most prominent lawmakers were notified about sexual assault allegations against Sen. Daylin Leach (D) almost one year ago but only initiated a formal investigation after the woman contacted nearly every member of the state senate this month.
The Philadelphia Inquirer reports :
 
Cara Taylor, who lives in the Allentown area, wrote in a February 2018 email to Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D., Allegheny) that Leach “sexually violated” her nearly 30 years ago, when she was a teenager and Leach was representing her mother in a criminal case. Costa forwarded the information to the chief legal counsel for Senate Democrats, who responded to Taylor that “neither Sen. Costa nor the Senate of Pennsylvania have the authority to review your claims under the Senate’s Workplace Harassment Policy,” according to a copy of the email exchange.
The chief counsel, C.J. Hafner II, noted that the accusations “predate Sen. Leach’s legislative service” and told her she could contact several organizations that offer counseling and referral services.
“I believe they have the experience and resources to assist you,” Hafner wrote.
Earlier this month, Taylor traveled to the Capitol and delivered to nearly every state senator copies of her private criminal complaint against Leach. That is when Senate Democrats decided to hire an outside legal firm to investigate the allegations, which Leach, a Montgomery County Democrat, vigorously denies.
Taylor alleges that in 1991 Leach, then a promising lawyer, lured her into performing oral sex on him while he defended her mother in an attempted homicide case. 
At the time Taylor was 17 and desperate to help her mother – going so far as to falsely take the blame for the attempted homicide.
