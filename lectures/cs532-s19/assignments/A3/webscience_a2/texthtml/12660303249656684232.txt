Welcome to Next of Ken and in this episode, we're counting down 41 Times Alec Baldwin Absolutely Nailed Trump. Oh no... we done did. We went political on Next of Ken. Actually, no. We didn't. Whether you love or hate Trump, you can't deny that Alec Baldwin's continued portrayal of Trump is LEGEND. It's the perfect blend of accurate and hyperbole and we can't get enough of it.
