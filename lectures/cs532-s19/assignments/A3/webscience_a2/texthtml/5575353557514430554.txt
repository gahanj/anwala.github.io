The last few months have not been kind to Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Ivanka, frequently attacked for being complicit in her fathers actions, is the subject of a new and unflattering art exhibit. More seriously, there are rumors that Jared Kushner might be among Robert Mueller’s next list of indictments.
Now the power couple has another scandal to deal with. Investigative Journalist, Vicky Ward, will be publishing a book detailing the couple’s marriage and private life.
The book is titled, Kushner Inc: Greed, Ambition and Corruption. The book will take a deep dive into the sordid legal troubles of Jared’s father, Charles.
In 2005, Charles Kushner was accused  of hiring a prostitute to entrap his brother in law, William Schulder. Schudler planned on testifying against Kushner. The prosecuting US Attorney was Chris Christie, a fact that led to a difficult relationship between Christie and Jared Kushner.
Charles Kushner, however, is not the only target. The book’s publisher says of Ivanka and Jared, “They are entitled inheritors of the worst kind; their combination of ignorance, arrogance and an insatiable lust for power has caused havoc all over the world, and may threaten the democracy of the United States.”
Kushner and Trump have already gone on the attack against the book. A spokesperson for Kushner’s lawyer says , “Every point that Ms. Ward mentioned in what she calls her ‘fact-checking’ stage is entirely false. It seems she has written a book of fiction rather than any serious attempt to get the facts. Correcting everything wrong would take too long and be pointless.”
Many Americans have forgotten about the Charles Kushner case, or did not know about it in the first place. Despite their best efforts to trash the book, it will provide some embarrassment to Jared and Ivanka.
