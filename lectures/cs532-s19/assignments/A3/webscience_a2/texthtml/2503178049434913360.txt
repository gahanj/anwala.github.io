Trump’s INSPIRING speech last night masterfully revealed the far-left radicals in Congress. He made several unifying points that garnered support from both parties and even the mainstream media! But despite his attempt to bring the country together, far leftists like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders REFUSED to show support for Trump’s stand that we will never be a socialist country, not killing late-term babies, and protecting innocent life from deadly crimes committed by illegal aliens. Not only are these radicals dividing our nation, but the bitterness these leftist radicals sow is preventing America from enjoying this period of immense American prosperity. Trump’s speech offered a glimmer of hope for a positive future.
