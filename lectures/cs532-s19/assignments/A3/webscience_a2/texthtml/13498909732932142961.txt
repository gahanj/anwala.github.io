( Kitco News ) - Although he made this assumption nearly one  year ago, the Donald’s comments on gold at Fort Knox – or lack thereof – are  making the rounds on Twitter again Tuesday.
Republican frontrunner Donald Trump hinted  at the idea that there just might be no gold in the U.S.
“I like the gold standard and there is  something very nice about it,” he said, in March 2015, in an interview with  Josh McElveen, host of Conversation with the Candidate on ABC affiliate WMUR9. “We used to have a very solid country because it was based on a gold standard.”
However, according to the real estate  mogul, it would be difficult to back the dollar by gold again.
“It would be very hard to do at this point  and one of the problems is we do not have the gold. Other places have the  gold,” he said.
According to the latest World Gold Council  data, the U.S. still ranks first in gold holdings, which are at 8,133.5 tonnes  as of March 2016. That represents 73.3% of the country’s total reserves. 
In the same interview from a year ago,  Trump was also very vocal about his lack of interest in the Federal Reserve.  When asked his position on auditing the U.S. central bank, Trump said, “Audit  it, absolutely.”
