President Trump weighed-in on the Senate Intel Chairman’s recent “no collusion” remarks Friday; saying his comments are “important” because the committee’s “interviewed 200 witnesses” and reviewed “300,000 pages of documents.”
“Not only did Senator Burr’s Committee find No Collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia, it’s important because they interviewed 200 witnesses and 300,000 pages of documents, & the Committee has direct access to intelligence information that’s Classified,” tweeted the President.

“If we write a report based upon the facts that we have, then we don’t have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia,” said Sen. Barr this week.
