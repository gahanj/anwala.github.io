Latinos are increasingly rallying for President Trump, according to data from a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll .
The poll notes that 50 percent of Latinos surveyed approve of the job Trump is doing, a 19-point increase from December of last year.
Republican strategist Gus Portella said Saturday on Fox & Friends that the improvement is "very important."
The poll also noted that 63 percent of all adults surveyed want to see elected officials make compromises.
It also said that 31 percent would want to see their elected officials "stick to their positions," while six percent are "unsure."
Portella said that Trump could fall into either category of making a compromise or sticking to what he believes.
"He's willing to make a deal, he's willing to compromise," Portella said. "But Democrats, on the other hand, they're simply not."
He said that Hispanics do care about border security, and that Democrats in the United States have "failed them."
"Democrats have not lived up to their word," Portella said.
