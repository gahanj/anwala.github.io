Watch:
Raising taxes on the rich is one of the things Democrats love to do in order to pay for all their wealth redistribution policies. And now the Trump Train has revealed itself today to really be a liberal locomotive, agreeing with the policy on raising taxes on the rich.
Just remember, the rich already pay most of the taxes anyway. Even a moderate Republican would have attacked the outrageous spending instead of suggesting the wealthy need to pay more, and they would have been right!
So Trump believes transgenders should use the bathroom of their choice , that the Republican platform on protecting the life of an unborn child should be liberalized , and that the rich should pay more.
