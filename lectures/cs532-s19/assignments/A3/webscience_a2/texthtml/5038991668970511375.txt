Wells Fargo in 2017 flagged half a million dollars in wire transfers and  bank  deposits to the account of Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-born lobbyist who has worked closely with opposition research firm Fusion  GPS  and also attended the infamous Trump Tower meeting.
According to BuzzFeed News , Wells Fargo flagged the transactions for the Treasury Department upon the request of federal investigators looking into the Trump Tower meeting, which was held on June 9, 2016.
Wells Fargo deemed the deposits suspicious because of “overseas origin” and because of “a suspicion that they showed Akhmetshin had violated federal lobbying law,” according to BuzzFeed.
Akhmetshin has been interviewed by several congressional committees and testified to the grand jury being used by special counsel Robert Mueller.
BuzzFeed’s report focuses on Akhmetshin’s involvement in the Trump Tower meeting, while largely ignoring his connection to  Fusion GPS , which commissioned the infamous Steele dossier on behalf of the Clinton campaign and DNC.
