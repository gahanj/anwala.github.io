 
More American voters trust Speaker Nancy Pelosi
ADVERTISEMENT
The responses were heavily split along party lines. Of those voters that identified as Republicans, 88 percent trusted Trump more than Pelosi, while 91 percent of the Democratic respondents said Pelosi was more dependent than Trump.
Those that identified as independent voters largely favored Pelosi on important issues. Forty-nine percent of independents said they trusted the Speaker more than Trump, while 36 percent of independents said they trusted the president more. 
The poll's results were released about a week after Trump signed a continuing resolution to temporarily reopen the government following a 35-day shutdown. The funding lapse was triggered after the White House and Congress failed to reach an agreement on a new spending bill. 
Trump has repeatedly demanded that more than $5 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border, which Democrats oppose. Congressional Democrats offered $1.3 billion in border security measures. 
Fifty-six percent of the poll's respondents said they blamed Trump and Republicans in Congress for the shutdown, which was the longest in U.S. history. 
In addition, 50 percent of those surveyed said they trusted Democrats in Congress more than Trump "on the issue of border security." Just 41 percent said they trusted Trump more. 
The Quinnipiac survey was conducted between Jan. 25-Jan. 28 among a population of 1,004 voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.
