RJC Ad in NY Times Thanks President Trump
Washington, DC (February 6, 2019) -- The Republican Jewish Coalition is running a full-page ad in the New York Times tomorrow, to thank President Trump for naming Elan Carr the U.S. State Department's Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism.
The ad, which is signed by dozens of RJC leaders, reads in part:
Thank you, President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for the appointment of Mr. Elan Carr as Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism.
...Anti-Semitism ranks among the oldest, most destructive forms of bigotry. It is a scourge of mankind... Hatred of the Jewish people can be heard in the voices of those who call for boycotting, divesting from, and sanctioning the world's only Jewish state. While the Iranian Majlis has long demonized Israel, anti-Semitic voices can now be heard in the halls of the British Parliament and even the U.S. Congress.
We thank President Trump for his courageous, clear-eyed leadership in engaging in the fight to defeat anti-Semitism. We stand shoulder to shoulder with President Trump in saying, "Never Again," and we pledge our full commitment to helping his administration, including Special Envoy Carr, in the days, weeks, and months to come.
