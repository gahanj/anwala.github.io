Donald Trump earned 59 Four-Pinocchio ratings as a presidential candidate. Now that heâs president, he has continued his proclivity for making dubious, misleading or false statements. He also often repeats the same debunked claims even though they have been fact-checked. Itâs hard to keep up with all of Trumpâs rhetoric, so the Fact Checker is assembling in one place all of his suspect statements from his first 100 days as president. You can sort them by various categories and see how many times he has repeated the same false statement.
Where were the claims made?
The greatest number of false and misleading claims were made                                               in remarks.

Trade
âThe change began with the termination of the Trans-Pacific Partnership â a 12-nation pact that would have shipped millions more jobs to other countries.â
Source: Statement
Predicting job losses or gains from a trade agreement is fairly difficult and often inaccurate but no credible analyst projected the loss of "millions" of U.S. jobs from the TPP.
âAfter years of federal contracts going to foreign bidders, we are ensuring that government agencies enforce âBuy Americanâ rules and give preference to American companies â and that American companies hire American workers.â

Trump now calls for Americans to âbuy American, hire American.â But this is misleading. Trump has a long history of outsourcing a variety of his own products. The Fact Checker has counted a total of 12 countries where Trump products were manufactured (China, the Netherlands, Mexico, India, Turkey, Slovenia, Honduras, Germany, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam and South Korea).
Trade
âWe are going to pursue a complete renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement: Weâve lost nearly a third of our manufacturing jobs in the 23 years since that terrible deal was approved.â
Repeated on Feb. 24 Mar. 15 Mar. 17 Apr. 18 Apr. 20 Apr. 21 Apr. 29
Source: Statement
Trumpâs attack on NAFTA is over the top. It is often difficult to separate out the impact of trade agreements on jobs, compared to other, broader economic trends. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 2015 concluded the ânet overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP,â though it noted âthere were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment among their economies.â
Foreign policy
âFinally, NATO countries are starting to pay billions of dollars more since I have made clear that the United States expects all of its allies to pay their fair share.â
Source: Statement
Long before Trump started complaining about NATO, members had committed to having defense spending account for two percent of each nation's gross domestic product by 2024.
âThousands of new jobs are being re-shored back to America â including jobs at Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, Sprint, Intel and so many more.â

Fact Checker rating: Source: Statement
Trump takes undue credit for business decisions made prior to his election. Fordâs decision to abandon its plans to open a factory in Mexico and instead expand its Michigan plant has more to do with the companyâs long-term goal â particularly its plans to invest in electric vehicles â than with the administration. Fiat Chrysler's plan to invest $1 billion for a factory in Michigan had been in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with Trump. Japanese company SoftBank announced its $100 billion technology investment fund three weeks before the U.S. elections, when Trump faced a narrow path to victory. Sprint said its hiring plan was a part of a commitment by SoftBank, which owns a controlling stake in Sprint. And Intel announced it would create at least 10,000 jobs at a ânewâ plant in Arizona. But Intel actually announced a $5 billion investment in this factory in 2011 with then-President Barack Obama.
Immigration
âAfter decades of unending illegal immigration and mass uncontrolled entry, weâve turned the tide as never before â illegal border-crossings are down 73 percent.â
Source: Statement
Trump is wrong to refer to "unending illegal immigration and mass uncontrolled entry" as Illegal immigration has been declining in general for years. He refers to the decline in apprehensions from December through March, which was 72 percent. Trump's rhetoric certainly has contributed to a decline in traffic along the border, but it's unclear how long the trend will last.
Miscellaneous
âWe really maxed out. We broke the all-time record for this arena.â

There were empty seats in the stands when Trump spoke at his 100th day rally in Harrisburg, Pa.

The Fact Checker's Trump Promise Tracker shows that of Trump's 100-day promises, he had kept six, broken five and taken no action on more than half of his promises.
Environment
âCompliance with the [Paris] agreement could shrink US GDP by $2.5 trillion over ten-year period.â
Source: Prepared speech
This is an extreme estimate produced by opponents of the agreement.
Trade
âI have been talking about currency manipulation [by China] for a long time but I have to tell you, during the election they stopped.â
Repeated on Apr. 21
Source: Prepared speech
Trump falsely claims China stopped devaluing its currency since he took office. China had not devalued its currency for about two years prior to his election. In fact, as recently as 10 days before his announcement that China was not manipulating its currency, Trump falsely blamed China for being a âworld championâ of devaluing the yuan.
Jobs
âIn just a few months we have created 99,000 new construction jobs, 49,000 new manufacturing jobs, 27,000 new mining jobsâ¦.We have over 600,000 new jobs.â
Repeated on Apr. 11
Source: Prepared speech
Trump again is counting the January jobs report, even though that concerns data for the period of Dec. 12 to Jan. 12, before he became president. So all of these numbers are inflated. Moreover, even if you counting January jobs, that brings the total to 533,000. The correct figure is 317,000. The other corrected jobs numbers are: construction (65,000); manufacturing (37,000) and mining (21,000). Obviously, a new president has little influence over broad economic trends.
Immigration
âWe have already achieved an unprecedented 73% reduction in illegal crossings on our southern border.â
Source: Prepared speech
Trump refers to the decline in apprehensions from December through March, which was 72 percent. Trump's rhetoric certainly has contributed to a decline in traffic along the border, but it's unclear how long the trend will last.
Jobs
âWe have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. 48,000 new jobs.â
Repeated on Jan. 24 Feb. 16 Feb. 18 Feb. 24 Feb. 28 Mar. 28 Apr. 4 Apr. 29
Source: Prepared speech
Trump appears to be combining two disputed figures â 28,000 jobs for Keystone XL and 12,000 for the Dakota Access Pipeline-- and then hyping it even more. We have looked closely at the Keystone numbers, and the same methodological issues appear to apply to the Dakota estimates. The actual number of Keystone construction jobs, for instance, is just 3,900 on an annualized basis â and other jobs have already been created (such as for building high-strength line pipe.) In the context of the U.S. economy, which just in January added 230,000 jobs, these are not many jobs.
âI have already saved $725 million on a simple order of F-35 airplanes.â
Repeated on Jan. 30 Feb. 6 Feb. 7 Feb. 18 Feb. 22 Feb. 23 Feb. 27 Feb. 28 Feb. 28 Mar. 15 Mar. 20 Mar. 21 Apr. 6 Apr. 21 Apr. 29
Fact Checker rating: Source: Prepared speech
Trump takes credit for the lowered cost, but the Pentagon had announced cost reductions of roughly $600 million on the F-35 before Trump began meeting with Lockheed Martinâs chief executive. Trump over time keeps increasing the money he allegedly saved.
Foreign policy
NATO countries âhave begun to increase their contribution by billions of dollars.â

Long before Trump started complaining about NATO, members had committed to having defense spending account for two percent of each nation's gross domestic product by 2024.

Source: Prepared speech
This is false. All eight of the Tennessee's rating areas have at least one insurance carrier and three of them have two carriers.
Economy
âWe have the all-time record for the biggest increase in the stock market.â
Source: Prepared speech
The increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in Trump's first 100 days is impressive -- a five percent gain. But George H.W. Bush had a 7.7 percent gain in his first 100 days, so Trump does not have the record. Moreover, what counts in the long run is the state of the economy at the end of a term, as Bush (who lost re-election) could tell Trump.
Miscellaneous
âI have issued a five-year ban on federal officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service. Good?â
Source: Prepared speech
Trump actually weakened Obama-era rules that were tougher and reduced transparency.
Immigration
âThe last, very weak administration allowed thousands and thousands of gang members to cross our borders and inter our communities where the have wreaked havoc on our citizens. The blood thirsty MS-13 has infiltrated our schools, threatening innocent children.â
Repeated on Apr. 18
Source: Prepared speech
The MS-13 gang far predates Obama, and has been active since the 1980s. According to the Congressional Research Service in 2005 and 2008, the gang had spread across the country since the 1980s. Moreover, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Trump has been arresting an increasing number of noncriminals, indicating that it's not just the gang members that are being targeted by his administration.
Foreign policy
âI didnât realize this, when he went to Russia, it was 2015 and he was on the Obama clearance. When General Flynn came to us, as you now know, he already had the highest clearance you can have.â
Repeated on Apr. 28
Source: Prepared speech
Flynn had received a security clearance under Obama, but Obama also fired Flynn from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Trump named Flynn as his national security adviser, before firing him three weeks after he took office, and the White House has not explained why his lobbying activities had not received greater scrutiny before Trump elevated him to the such a top security position.
Health care
âBut when I watch some of the news reports, which are so unfair, and they say we donât cover pre-existing conditions, we cover it beautifully.â
Source: Prepared speech
The American Health Care Act, the House GOP plan, would have made significant changes in such coverage if a state sought possible waivers from rules for people who had more than a two-month lapse in insurance.

Immigration
âShe's [Republican Karen Handel] running against someone who's going to raise your taxes to the sky, destroy your healthcare, and he's for open borders.â
Repeated on Apr. 17 Apr. 18
Source: Prepared speech
Jon Ossoff, the Democrat Trump is referring to, supports a comprehensive immigration bill that allows a "path to legal status" for undocumented people (excluding felons) living in the country. But he also said he supports strong border security. As PolitiFact found, this is not the same as "allowing illegal immigration." On taxes, factcheck.org found that Ossoff has proposed to simplify the tax code, and that âin order to lower tax rates, we can eliminate carve-outs and special treatment in the tax code that privilege large organizations at the expense of small businesses.â
Election
âThe Republicans have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College, you know that. Tremendous disadvantage.â
Repeated on Apr. 21
Source: Prepared speech
Trump certainly deserves credit for breaching the so-called âblue wallâ â the Midwestern states that have backed Democrats in recent years. But Republicans have an advantage because they have an edge in small, rural states, which in the electoral college system requires fewer votes per elector. In Wyoming, for instance, there are 143,000 people for each electoral vote, compared to 500,000 in a state like California. Since Democrats tend to concentrated in large cities, the impact of those votes are dissipated. This is one reason why in two recent elections â 2000 and 2016 -- the Democrat won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College.
Immigration
âBut you need that wall to stop the human trafficking, to stop the drugs, to stop the wrong people. You need the wall.â
Repeated on Apr. 25
Source: Prepared speech
There is little evidence that human trafficking takes place over the U.S.-Mexican border. While human trafficking is a problem in some parts of the world, experts say it is relatively limited in the United States, especially for sexual exploitation. But in general data is limited on the extent of human trafficking.  As for drugs, that is also dubious. Experts say that drugs are actually shipped through the border on the underside of vehicles that have permits to cross the border in a special lane.

Economy
âI predict I will probably pay more [under my tax plan] than Iâm paying right now.â
Source: Interview
This is almost certainly a false statement, though because Trump failed to disclose his tax returns that's difficult to verify. But just the elimination of the alternative minimum tax -- which cost Trump $31 million in 2005 -- would be a huge savings for Trump. The New York Times estimated the proposed tax plan would have saved Trump about $50 million in 2005.

Trade
âThe trade deficit with Mexico is close to $70 billion. Even with Canada, it's $17 billion -- a trade deficit with Canada.â

Trump is citing figures for trades in goods, but not including services. The United States had a trade surplus of $12 billion with Canada and trade deficit of $55 billion when services are included.

âWe never, ever seem to have a surplus with countries.  Every country takes advantage of the United States, and it's not going to happen anymore.â

Not true. Thereâs barely a trade deficit in goods with the United Kingdom, according to the International Trade Commission, and the United States has a trade surplus with Hong Kong ($30 billion), Netherlands ($24 billion), United Arab Emirates ($21 billion), Belgium ($15 billion), Australia ($14 billion), Singapore ($10 billion) and Brazil ($4 billion), among others.

Foreign policy
âRussia story was made up because they were embarrassed by their loss.  They had this tremendous loss, a loss like nobody's ever seen before.â
Repeated on Feb. 26
Source: Interview
Trump is falsely labeling nonpartisan investigations as made up by Democrats. The CIA concluded in 2016 that Russia intervened in the U.S. presidential election to help elect Trump, an assessment backed up by FBI Director James B. Comey and then-Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. On Jan. 6, the intelligence community released a declassified report expressing "high confidence" in this judgement. Senate and House committees led by Republicans have begun their own investigations, and at least one Republican lawmaker has called for the appointment of a special prosecutor.
Foreign policy
âJust remember, he [Michael Flynn] was approved by the Obama administration at the highest level.  And when they say we didn't vet, well, Obama, I guess, didn't vet, because he was approved at the highest level of security by the Obama administration.â

Flynn had received a security clearance under Obama, but Obama also fired Flynn from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Trump named Flynn as his national security adviser, before firing him three weeks after he took office, and the White House has not explained why his lobbying activities had not received greater scrutiny before Trump elevated him to the such a top security position.
Economy
Source: Interview
Trump is simply wrong when he says the United States is the highest taxed nation in the world. The Pew Research Center, using 2014 data, found that the tax bill for Americans, under various scenarios, is below average for developed countries. In 2014, according to comparative tables of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product â the broadest measure of the economy â was 26 percent for the United States. Out of 34 countries, that put the United States in the bottom third â and well below the OECD average of 34.4 percent.
Miscellaneous
âWe had a case where I got involved the last few days in Atlanta -- in fact, I'm going there today -- for Karen [Handel].  He [Democrat Jon Ossoff] looked like he was going to win.  He had about 56 percent of the vote.  If he gets 50, he wins, we have now a Democratic congressman. I did a robocall.  I did some tweets.  I did some interviews.  He didn't get the number, and I believe she's going win, and she might win very easily.â
Source: Interview
There was never any polling indicating that Democrat Jon Ossoff was going to get 56 percent of the vote in an open primary in Georgia's strongly Republican 6th Congressional District. There was a possibility he would get just over 50 percent, which would have eliminated a run-off election and been an embarrassing loss for the GOP.  Trump took credit for the Ossoff getting 48 percent, even though Republicans in the race distanced themselves from Trump as the election got closer.

A study by Bloomberg News, with a more expansive definition of federal spending, came up with an estimate of $2.1 billion. Moreover, while the website had trouble in its early months, those were quickly fixed and it now works.

San Francisco and Santa Clara County, the governments that sued over Trump's sanctuary order, are in California. So that's where they would need to file a lawsuit. They also did not get to choose the judge that ruled against Trump. We have earlier explored the claim about the Ninth Circuit being overturned 80 percent. The Ninth Circuit is not the most overturned court by the annual reversal rate. It does have a high raw number of reversals or number of cases on the Supreme Court docket. But it also reviews more cases than other circuits, is larger than other circuits and terminates far more cases than other circuits.

There is limited research on the impact of sanctuary policies and crime. And the research that does exist challenges Trumpâs claim. Thereâs no official definition of âsanctuary,â but it generally refers to rules restricting state and local governments from alerting federal authorities about people who may be in the country illegally. A handful of studies looked at whether there is a causation between sanctuary cities and crime. They either found no statistically significant impact of sanctuary policies on crime, or a reduction in crime due to immigrant-friendly policing strategies.

Trump certainly deserves credit for breaching the so-called âblue wallâ â the Midwestern states that have backed Democrats in recent years. But Republicans have an advantage because they have an edge in small, rural states, which in the electoral college system requires fewer votes per elector. In Wyoming, for instance, there are 143,000 people for each electoral vote, compared to 500,000 in a state like California. Since Democrats tend to concentrated in large cities, the impact of those votes are dissipated. This is one reason why in two recent elections â 2000 and 2016 -- the Democrat won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College.

Trump repeated one of his favorite claims during an interview with Financial Times that published on April 2. Trump keeps giving himself credit for business decisions made before he became president. Fordâs decision has more to do with the companyâs long-term goal â particularly its plans to invest in electric vehicles â than with the administration. Hereâs what Ford chief executive Mark Fields said about the companyâs decision to abandon plans to open a factory in Mexico: âThe reason that we are not building the new plant, the primary reason, is just demand has gone down for small cars.â

The House Republican legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act was pulled from a looming House vote on March 24 after congressional leaders realized that it would fail to pass by a large margin. Thereâs no way to spin this except as a failure, especially since passage in the House would only be the first step on a long legislative journey. Senate Republicans generally are cool to the House proposal and are likely to pursue their own path. Then the two versions must be reconciled and pass both chambers before success could be declared. But Trump failed to advance even to first base. Itâs true he might get another chance at-bat, but the effort is indeed a failure so far.
âWe will save perhaps $900 billion....I'm saving a tremendous amount â hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars we're saving on health care.â

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office report on the Republican bill said it would reduce the deficit by $337 billion over the next decade. Trump appears to be referring to a $900 billion reduction in revenue from the repeal of Obamacare taxes, but thatâs actually money lost to the federal government. The proposed law would have reduced federal spending on health care by $1.2 trillion but the repeal in taxes means the impact on the budget is significantly smaller.

Trump suggests that he isnât filling administration posts because of Democratic obstruction. Democrats have slow-walked many of his cabinet nominees, but Trump has been much slower than his predecessors in filling sub-cabinet posts and other positions. Out of 553 key positions requiring Senate confirmation, 478 still have no nominee, according to the Partnership for Public Service. Another 29 have been announced but not formally nominated; only 22 positions have been confirmed. Republican senators have said they are growing impatient with the White Houseâs slow pace. So Trump really should be pointing the finger at his own staff.

Trump has it backward. On July 5, 2016, Comey issued a tough statement about Clintonâs actions concerning her private email server, saying she was âextremely carelessâ in the handling of classified information, but he said it is âour judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.â  Comey added that the FBI looked back at previous cases involving the handling of classified information. âWe cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts,â he said. âAll the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here.â

Trump continues to grasp on slim reeds to claim he was correct when he falsely tweeted that former president Barack Obama âtappedâ his phones at Trump Tower. No evidence has emerged to support that claim and it was denied by Comey. But in recent days he has claimed former national security adviser Susan Rice may have violated laws because she requested the identities of U.S. citizens who were incidentally recorded or referenced in surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency. Numerous former national security officials said that Rice had every right to make those requests. CNN reported that a review of classified documents by both Republican and Democratic documents found no evidence that Rice and other Obama administration officials did anything unusual or illegal.

Trump keeps taking credit for projects that were long in the works before he became president. For example, he repeatedly claims credit for Fordâs decision to abandon its plans to open a factory in Mexico and instead expand its Michigan plant. But analysts say Fordâs decision has more to do with the companyâs long-term goal â particularly, its plans to invest in electric vehicles â than the administration. Itâs easier for companies to find highly skilled workers to build new products, such as electric cars, in the United States than in Mexico.

False on several levels. NATO has been involved in counterterrorism since 1980, and especially since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. As for NATOâs financing, Trump apparently still does not understand how it works. NATOâs guideline, established in 2006, is that defense expenditures should amount to 2 percent of each countryâs gross domestic product by 2024. In 2016, only four countries besides the United States met that standard, but NATO documents also show that defense spending has increased about 3 percent from 2015 to 2016. In any case, the money would not be going to the United States or even necessarily to NATO; this is money that countries would spend to bolster their own military.

Trump is referring to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which ruled against reinstating his travel ban. But there are other ways to slice the data, and itâs important to put this number into context. Most cases reviewed by the Supreme Court are reversed, and the 9th Circuit rules on more cases in general. The 9th Circuitâs reversal rate was usually higher than the average, but not always the highest.

The baseline for the $4,000 figure goes all the way back to 2008, the year before Obama took the oath of office.

Moreover, since the Affordable Care Act became law, the rate of increase in healthcare costs have slowed. It is still debated by experts about whether the law gets all of the credit, but if costs had continued on the previous path, premiums would have been $3,600 higher.

This is an absurd Four-Pinocchio claim, based on a real number. The 94 million "not in labor force" that Trump refers to are based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 2015. It turns out that 93 percent do not want a job at all. The picture that emerges from a study of the data shows that the 95 million consists mostly of people who are retired, students, stay-at-home parents or disabled.

In 2016, there was an uptick in the homicide rate in the 30 largest cities. One outlier city -- Chicago -- was responsible for 43.7 percent of the total increase in homicide rates in 2016. Seven people were shot and killed in Chicago on Feb. 22, the deadliest day in the city so far this year. Overall, violent crime is on a decades-long decline, since the height of the crack cocaine epidemic in the early 1990s.

NATOâs guideline, established in 2006, is that defense expenditures should amount to 2 percent of each countryâs gross domestic product. In 2016, only four countries besides the United States met that standard, but NATO documents also show that defense spending has increased about three percent from 2015 to 2016. In any case, the money would not be going to the United States or even necessarily to NATO; this is money that countries would spend to bolster their own military.

The CIA concluded in 2016 that Russia intervened in the U.S. presidential election to help elect Trump, an assessment backed up by FBI Director James B. Comey and then-Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. On Jan. 6, the intelligence community released a declassified report expressing "high confidence" in this judgement.

Using the same logic, you could claim that after four days in office Trump increased outstanding public debt by more than $10 billion, and that Obama had reduced it by $6 billion.

Trump is exaggerating here. Boeing only had a $170 million contract to begin designing a replacement for Air Force One, and the cost of the project had not been set. The Defense Departmentâs five-year plan indicated a cost of $2.9 billion over the next five years for design and development. Itâs logical to assume at least another $1 billion in additional expenses to complete and procure the aircraft. An estimate of $4 billion â for design, testing and manufacture of at least two jets â was not completely out of line. But the budget was subject to approval by Congress and the actual design of the aircraft. So Trump is taking credit for cutting a price that had not been negotiated yet.

There is limited research on the impact of sanctuary policies and crime. And the research that does exist challenges Trumpâs claim.

This is false and facile. The terrorist group is the direct result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, which Trump had supported.

Trumpâs figures on the scope of the travel ban were ludicrously low. The universe of people likely affected by the travel suspension was around 60,000, according to the State Department â not 109.

The payment was connected to a $1.7 billion settlement of claims with Iran announced by the State Department, in which $400 million was always Iranâs money. (The rest was negiotiated interest.) In the 1970s, the then-pro-Western Iranian government under the shah paid $400 million for U.S. military equipment. But the equipment was never delivered because the two countries broke off relations after the seizure of American hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Iran. Trump says the United States has nothing to show for it, but the money was transferred on the same day four Americans being held in Iran were released, though the Obama administration denied there was any connection.

There is limited research on the impact of sanctuary policies and crime. And the research that does exist challenges Trumpâs claim. Thereâs no official definition of âsanctuary,â but it generally refers to rules restricting state and local governments from alerting federal authorities about people who may be in the country illegally. A handful of studies looked at whether there is a causation between sanctuary cities and crime. They either found no statistically significant impact of sanctuary policies on crime, or a reduction in crime due to immigrant-friendly policing strategies.

Trump appears to referring to a news story he posted on his Facebook account â that Kuwait had issued âits own Trump-esque visa ban for five Muslim-majority countries.â Trump added: âSmart!â But it turned out this was fake news. Kuwait âcategorically denies these claims,â the countryâs foreign ministry said. Trumpâs Facebook post has not been taken down.

Trump tweeted a number of critical comments about the âso-called judgeâ who halted the presidentâs travel ban of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. The judiciary was established in the U.S. Constitution as a third branch of government (along with the executive and legislative branches), part of the complex system of checks and balances that ensures the continuation of democracy. Marbury v. Madison, a Supreme Court case decided more than 200 years ago, helped establish the notion of judicial review and cemented the notion that the judiciary was equal in power to the president and Congress.

There is little evidence that the ruling halting Trumpâs order has allowed âvery bad and dangerous peopleâ to pour into the country. The practical effect of the order was to restore visas and refugee admissions. Being accepted as a refugee in the United States is a difficult, lengthy process. Obtaining a U.S. visa generally requires an in-person interview, unless you are a citizen of one of 38 countries that participate in the visa-waiver program. Under a 2015 law, however, four of the seven countries covered in the ban require even dual citizens to have an in-person interview.

If Trump were just talking about all business loans, his statement would be wrong. Commercial lending is at record highs. The picture is murkier if he were referring only to small businesses, as the White House claims. Trump specifically mentioned the ârules and regulationsâ of Dodd-Frank. The law was not intended to target community banks, and it carved out many exemptions. But regulatory oversight appears to have become tougher, so a case could be made that the post-Dodd-Frank regulatory environment made it harder for community banks to make small-business loans.

Many countries â but not the United States â have a value-added tax, in which tax is collected at each stage in the production or distribution of a product or service. But with refunds, the burden is really paid by the final consumer. Moreover, the VAT also affects domestic producers. In terms of tariffs, it is incorrect the United States charges ânothing or little.â The United States imposes tariffs on Chinese goods, but they are not as high as Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods.

This is a flip-flop for Trump. Before becoming president, Trump heartily endorsed WikiLeaks and the release of classified information, particularly about his then-rival Hillary Clinton. During a July 2016 news conference, Trump even called on Russia to hack Clintonâs email account. Now, facing information leaks out of his own administration (including information that led to the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn), Trump decided itâs a bad thing.

The suburbs around Washington are among the richest in the United States, largely because of the federal government (which attracts people with college or advanced degrees). Among the 25 most populous metropolitan areas, the D.C. metro area has the highest median income in the nation -- $93,294 versus a U.S. median of $55,775 -- though growth has slowed in recent years, in part because of reductions in defense spending. Indeed, income in the D.C. area has grown essentially at the same rate as the rest of the nation since 2006, including a dip in median income during the Great Recession. But there is no empirical evidence that the D.C. area got rich off the rest of the country, as Trump suggests.
