The first daughter attended the White House pardoning ceremony for the National Thanksgiving Turkey yesterday in a short leg-baring outfit, stealing the spotlight from the two turkeys being granted a second chance — Wishbone and Drumstick. For the occasion, Tiffany wore a short red tweed coat with hints of pink. She must have been wearing an even shorter dress or skirt underneath because her legs were bare and accentuated by black pumps.
The public was in large part shocked; multiple news outlets have reported not on the event but on Tiffany’s outfit. Hollywood Life called her jacket “very short” and said she “decided to turn heads by baring her long legs in a super-short minidress and equally short red jacket.” The  Daily Mail questioned her choice considering the chilly fall weather. And Twitter agrees. Some called her look “saucy,” while others reprimanded her for wearing such an outfit to the White House. Many just wished she had worn pantyhose.
This looks so bad….why didn't someone tell her to put on tights?…or at least nude hose (like Kate Middleton). | Forget something? #TiffanyTrump puts her bare legs on full display in a very short coat and heels https://t.co/ijwCjOudXF
Tiffany Trump braved the chilly weather for the annual White House Thanksgiving turkey pardoning by wearing a very short coat, showing off her long bare legs. We've got her saucy look.
THAT'S TOO SHORT, LOOK AT THE BACK, TIFFANY. ANYTHING THAT SHORT SHOULD BE WORN W/ TIGHTS & NOT AT WH Tiffany Trump shows off her bare legs in a very short coat https://t.co/uViMdzYmD6 via @Femail
Others didn’t even notice her legs, because they were too distracted by her interaction with the turkeys.

The second most talked-about person at the event? Not Donald, or even Wishbone, but Ivanka. She and her daughter Arabella were twinning in red coats, matching Tiffany. Ivanka’s outfit was a little more demure. She was decked out in head-to-toe Dolce and Gabbana, starting with a pink and red floral jacquard skirt that costs $1,695. On top she wore a double-breasted red peacoat with mismatching decorative buttons and a Sicilian-style standing collar. The coat retails for $3,000. She also wore black pumps and black tights
Arabella’s red coat featured a big bow on the neckline. She wore it with tall back boots.
Even Melania Trump jumped on the red bandwagon, pairing her long Thanksgiving-themed multicolor  Stella McCartney coat , which is currently on sale for $975, with a red sweater and a brown leather skirt.
If this is how they dress for Thanksgiving, we can’t wait to see their coordinated Christmas outfits.
