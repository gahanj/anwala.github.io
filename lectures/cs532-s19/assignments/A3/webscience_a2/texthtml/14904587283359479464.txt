AUSTIN, Texas (AP)  — Beto O’Rourke will lead a march though his hometown of El Paso, Texas, to protest a border wall at the same time President Donald Trump will be holding a rally there to promote it.
O’Rourke is teaming with dozens of civic and human rights organizations for a Monday evening event he says will counter the spreading of “lies and a false narrative about the U.S.-Mexico border.”
Oddly, AP doesn’t mention who the “dozens of civic and human rights organizations” are, likely meaning they contain some pretty sketchy groups.
Also, turns out Robert doesn’t like walls, or any deterrence on the border.
Not only that, but walls and militarization of the border have resulted in the deaths of thousands of migrants, including children. We are pushing desperate families to cross in ever more hostile terrain.
So….America is killing desperate families by making it harder for them to cross illegally?
