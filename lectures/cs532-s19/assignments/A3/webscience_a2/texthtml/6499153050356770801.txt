President Donald Trump's 2019 state of the union address is in the history books, and Sen. Bernie Sanders is here to deliver a sharp response. While the official Democratic response to the State of the Union came from Stacey Abrams, Bernie Sanders recorded his own. Sanders addressed issues including income inequality, the economy, student debt, health care, reproductive rights, and opioids.
