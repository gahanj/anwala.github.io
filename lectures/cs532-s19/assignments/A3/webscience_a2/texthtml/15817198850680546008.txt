Some audience members at this year’s annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington likely did a double take when President Donald Trump hailed “people of faith” for their “abolition of civil rights.”
“Since the founding of our nation, many of our greatest strides — from gaining our independence to abolition of civil rights to extending the vote for women — have been led by people of faith,” Trump declared in his speech Thursday.

That’s probably not exactly how the president intended to put it.
No matter, because some gleeful Twitter users enjoyed another opportunity to chortle at an apparent Trump gaffe. Amid the religious right ’s efforts to limit such rights as abortion access and same-sex marriage, others concluded that the president may have seen the light.
He would be correct. They are leading the abolition of civil rights today. https://t.co/LmqOmEB5XJ
So now he decides to be honest. Finally!
Someone needs to educate Trump - preferably someone like Betsy Ross and not @BetsyDeVosED
Trump finally said something honest at the National Prayer Breakfast.
When you've got kids in cages and refuse asylum seekers who are already in the country, "abolition of civil rights" pretty much covers it. #thursdaymotivation #thursdaythoughts pic.twitter.com/9Qj1dg4hAJ
they celebrate it in Russia
Scary thing is he might secretly be telling the truth
Let me guess..and the audience applauded? Who’s in the audience again?
Trump speaking in tongues....but it isn't God speaking
