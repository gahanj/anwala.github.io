EA on Al Jazeera’s Inside Story: Why is Trump Protecting Saudi’s MBS Over Khashoggi Murder?

I joined Al Jazeera’s Inside Story on Saturday to discuss why Donald Trump, defying the US Congress, continues to protect Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman over the October murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
On Friday Trump missed the 120-day deadline to report to legislators about sanctions on Riyadh under the Global Magnitsky Act, which punished individuals and entities for human rights abuses. Doing so, he also challenged US and Turkish intelligence agencies who have concluded that the Crown Prince is responsible for the assassination.
Turkish political analyst Selva Tor and I discuss the politics from Washington to Turkey to Saudi Arabia to the UN. Meanwhile, an uninformed Drew Liquerman of Republicans Abroad UK, defending Trump, slanders Khashoggi and concocts a conspiracy of GOP Senators and the CIA supporting Iran over the Saudi-led intervention in the Yemen Civil War.
