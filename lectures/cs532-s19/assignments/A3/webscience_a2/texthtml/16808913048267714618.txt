Trump claims to be a really big fan of church, but the facts say otherwise. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down.
Read more here:
"President Donald Trump gave Bible literacy legislation a shout-out on Monday with a tweet praising states that are “starting to make a turn back” to an unspecified time when public schools apparently relished in Bible study.
As The Washington Post’s Mark Chancy noted, there was no such time in American history.
And as Trump’s former pastor noted, in any case, the president can’t exactly speak with much authority on the subject.
Pastor David Lewicki responded to Trump’s tweet on Tuesday morning, explaining how he served as a pastor at New York City’s Marble Collegiate Church for about five years in the mid-aughts.
Despite being on the member rolls, Trump never showed. Not to Bible study ― and not even to a service, according to Lewicki."
