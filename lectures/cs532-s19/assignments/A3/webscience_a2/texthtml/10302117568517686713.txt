‘No Collusion’: Trump Weighs In On The Results Of Burr’s Russian Probe – True Pundit
2 weeks ago
President Donald Trump used a bipartisan Senate investigation into Russian meddling Friday morning to burnish his continued insistence that Democrats are engaged in a political witch hunt.
“Not only did Senator Burr’s Committee find No Collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia, it’s important because they interviewed 200 witnesses and 300,000 pages of documents, & the Committee has direct access to intelligence information that’s Classified,”  Trump tweeted .

The president  was referring  to Republican North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr’s admission that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has been unable to find any evidence that Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia.
The panel has  conducted  more than 200 interviews and reviewed hundreds of thousands of documents as part of an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
“If we write a report based upon the facts that we have, then we don’t have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia,” Burr  told CBS News Thursday .
Burr and  Virginia Sen. Mark Warner , a Democrat and vice chairman of the committee, have operated in unison during the Senate probe. Burr noted in his CBS interview that he and Warner agreed early on that they would only take major investigative steps, subpoenas or witness interviews, only if both of them approved.
