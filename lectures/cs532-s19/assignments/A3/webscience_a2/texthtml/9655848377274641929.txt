A CBS/YouGov poll released yesterday showed than 43-percent of Democrats approved of President Trump's State of the Union address. However, this news was not shown on CBS News' broadcast shows like CBS This Morning or CBS Evening News, according to NewsBusters, but only on CBS's online streaming-only service CBSN discussed it.
"In fact, the only mention of the poll results, on CBSâs broadcast programs, came in a 17-second brief by co-host John Dickerson on the January 31 edition of CBS This Morning," Newsbusters reported.
