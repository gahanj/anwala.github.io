About this Video
------------------------------------------------------
I know a lot of other videos out there have some of these clips in them (some far more artfully done by the way! ) ... but I wanted one with ALL of them spliced together chronologically because I think the story they tell is really fascinating and inspiring. Whatever you choose to believe or not on what the media reports about him in 2016, weigh that against Mr. Trump's own words from interviews going back 30+ years.
Time stamps to each segment:
------------------------------------------------------
* 1987 Oprah Interview 00:47
* 1988 GOP Convention 01:58
* 2012 CNN Comments on Romney 09:08
* 2012 CNBC Interview on Economy 09:22
* 2014 Speaking at CPAC 11:18
* 2015 Press Event 14:17
* 2017 Presidential Inauguration! 32:39
** Copies/Reposts (just for reference, view counts):
------------------------------------------------------
I still find it somewhat odd people would copy this video vs just link to it but viewcount/spreading the word is the most important thing... so very cool!! If anyone else finds other copies please chime in so we can tally up the counts again!  Here are the copies I'm aware of:
Credits, etc.
* Trump's NYT ad from 1987: https://goo.gl/tm39ja
* Video Clips: All video clip credit/copyright goes to each clip's respective owner/organization.
* Note: In case anyone sees ads w/this video - I didn't set any of these up to be monetized - if ads do show up it's because YouTube struck this video with a copyright flag because I used the AirForceOne song (same Trump used at RNC Convention).
