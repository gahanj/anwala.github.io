President Trump was considering former FBI Director Robert Mueller to replace James Comey atop the bureau before Mueller was named as special counsel to oversee the investigation into Russian election interference,  NPR  reported Friday. 
Mueller met with Justice Department and White House officials about leading the FBI again after Trump fired Comey in early May, the report said.
But when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein named Mueller as the special counsel to oversee the Russia probe, he was removed from contention.
