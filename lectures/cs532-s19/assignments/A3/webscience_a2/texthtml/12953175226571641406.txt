Michelle Obama Stoops to New Low, Makes Fun of Melania Trump in Disgraceful New Interview
Melania Trump has done a fantastic job at representing the United States since she became the First Lady. She has definitely had an uphill battle in spreading her message and promoting her platform. As the wife of President Trump, Melania has faced more scrutiny than any First Lady in history.
Now, Michelle Obama is going on the offensive and attacking Melania in a disgraceful new interview. Michelle sat down with Jimmy Fallon to discuss the Presidential Inauguration and to reveal her thoughts about the day.
Bye, Felicia! Michelle Obama opens up about that awkward moment Melania Trump tried to hand her a gift https://t.co/OiyWhl4A6M https://t.co/QoxSH5MdRB #blacktwitter pic.twitter.com/9L6flqBcxC
When Fallon showed a picture of Michelle and Barack waving goodbye, he asked her what she was thinking. Michelle revealed that the internet meme “Bye Felicia” was a great description of her thoughts as they handed the White House over to the Trump family.
The meme “Bye Felicia” has spread on social media in recent years. It refers to an Ice Cube movie in which Ice Cube’s character dismisses a woman who is asking to borrow drugs and a car from another character. Urban Dictionary has gone on to define the term as bidding “farewell to someone deemed unimportant.”
. @MichelleObama joked, while on the @FallonTonight show, she was thinking "Bye, Felicia" as she left the White House and received a Tiffany's box from the incoming @FLOTUS . https://t.co/hF8pG0kNVL pic.twitter.com/kudWBrwbIr
Beyond that insult, Michelle then went on to make fun of the Tiffany’s present that Melania handed her as the Trumps met the Obamas outside the White House. Michelle then gave a smirk to the crowd as people laughed. Michelle has since revealed that a frame was inside the box, however, it appears she wasn’t very grateful for the present or the kind gesture from Melania.
“Not set to return to the White House again, Mrs Obama could not place the gift inside the West Wing for safe keeping, but nor could she take it with her to the inauguration ceremony. After a few seconds of awkwardly holding the present trying to decide how to overcome the dilemma, a member of staff came to her rescue and temporarily looked after the gift,” reported Express.

RT ItsJaylees: Michelle Obama Finally Revealed What Was in That Tiffany Box From Melania Trump https://t.co/z1Q3DERffe
It’s truly sad to see Michelle dismiss Melania’s actions in this way. As a former First Lady, Michelle should show respect for the position and work to unite the nation in their support for both America and the Trump family.

That disgusting skanky fraud trying to pass itself off as a female is a filthy excuse for a human. It wouldn’t know class if it got bit in that fat ass. What a f’ing POS that cow is. If I were Melania, I would have rigged that box to blow up in that baboons nasty face.
February 10, 2019 at 10:21 pm
Awesome ! I love your attitude and your spot on opinion of the old tired cotton field plowhorse  ( Jackass ).
February 20, 2019 at 9:32 pm
Trash is Trash, Thats the Obamas, They did everything he could to destroy this country. Finally America woke Up and Voted for Donald Trump.
February 10, 2019 at 10:55 pm
There is nothing that Michelle can say or do to make herself look better. For me just seeing whatever she is, is gone is good enough for me. I don’t need to be mean. She proves to everyone all by  herself how  grateful we are that we no longer have to put up with her hate and spite.
February 11, 2019 at 2:25 am
Michelle never did Anything for America except so how trashing they really are. You can take a guy out of the gutter but you can’t take the gutter out of this guy.
He spent a shit load of taxpayer money.
February 19, 2019 at 3:08 am
Let’s see.  Donald Trump has added $2 trillion to the debt in two years.  Obama added $10 trillion in 8 years.  But Trump did a major upgrade of the Armed Forces, which had to be done.  I think Obama wins the debt competition.
February 19, 2019 at 9:08 pm
Michelle, Aren’t we trying to get rid of the “N”. Word??  You could help a lot by changing your hateful attitude toward, you know, not black people!!
February 10, 2019 at 12:48 am
I think it proves what I already knew.  Michelle has zero class.
February 17, 2019 at 12:02 am
No. Michelle has TONS of class. Unfortunately for her, it’s all Low!
February 10, 2019 at 12:49 am
It is what you would expect from a low life person  which is what I feel she is
February 10, 2019 at 12:54 am
Michelle has no class and she’s very jealous of our beautiful and classy First Lady Melania!
February 10, 2019 at 12:57 am
In my lifetime, never seen anything like this; horrible, disrespectful way for Michelle to treat Melania.  Michelle did nothing for the USA and needs to be deported as far as I’m concerned for treasonous behavior.
But where would we deport her to?
February 12, 2019 at 2:51 pm
Amen!  I think back to her when at every event she seemed to be mad at the world.  She has such an ugly disposition.  When the Honor for 911 was given and they used the US Flag…she was over heard to say “All this for a Flag?” How disgusting.  She and Obama took the American voters and people to the cleaners with “all things” extravagant.
Melania is doing a superb job as First Lady.  She has class, elegance and grace.  A few things Michelle will never be.
Obama went abroad and called us arrogant.  He said we had not traveled enough to be enlightened! He sold our Country out never completed anything he professed, stifled our economy and he and Holder together were a disgrace then you add Hillary to the mix.  There are so many crimes in that Administration that many need to be held accountable for.
February 10, 2019 at 12:58 am
just shows who has the less class…Melania out shined Micheal, and it showed
February 10, 2019 at 8:14 am
The Obamas were the most low class people to ever live in the White House. Michelle’s actions, inappropriate clothing, and rudeness were a disgrace.
Truer words were never spoken!
Speaking of clothing, is she wearing the latest prison fashion ?
February 10, 2019 at 12:58 am
Michelle Obama is so low class….such a disgrace to our country!
February 10, 2019 at 2:01 am
Well, (s)he claimed to hate America until ‘her’ partner usurped White House.
February 10, 2019 at 2:42 am
WELL WHAT ELSE DOES MIKE HAVE TO SAY>>> HAHAHA SHE IS A REAL WOMAN AND YOU?????? HAHAHAHA ONLY YOU MIKE, CAN DREAM ABOUT…
February 10, 2019 at 12:59 am
DISGRACEFUL, RUDE, CRUDE, DEMENTED, MEANSPIRITED, VICIOUS, VILE and UNCALLED FOR. She is SO JEALOUS of the first lady as a woman of class. Michelle could NOT have shown her true colors as she did with this interview. When you feel compelled to demonize a STUNNINGLY CLASSY First Lady, then you LOOK like a spoiled child. SAD that Michelle took the route that was far beneath her.
February 10, 2019 at 1:53 am
The route Michelle Obama was NOT far beneath her at all. It was typically her. She is and has always been a horrid creature. Unworthy of ever having been a first lady.Michelle Obama is the epitome of low class.
February 10, 2019 at 2:44 am
Nothing is beneath Michelle….she is and always has been , a nasty, vile, hateful  woman !! (Not sure she is a woman )…NEVER LIKED HER OR HER TRAITOR  HUSBAND !!!!  THEY BOTH HATE AMERICA AND TRIED TO DESTROY  IT WHILE IN THE WHITE HOUSE ….they are both very upset that they did not have enough time to get the job done !! PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS BEAUTIFUL, CLASSY WIFE could care less what Jackass Michelle has to say or think about them !! GREAT JOB TRUMP !!! MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !!!!!
February 10, 2019 at 6:51 pm
Michelle Obama is a very Low class human being. Such hate for everyone and everything, including her hatred of AMERICA.
February 10, 2019 at 10:28 pm
Mike , Meeshell , It…what ever you want to call it , came from  the gutter and has stayed in the gutter and never will exscape the gutter .
February 10, 2019 at 1:03 am
How snobbish and petty can you get? Was it awkward? Yes, but who cares, it was a nice sentiment. I never could understand people reacting like that in these particular situations. Who cares if the incoming FLOTUS gave the outgoing FLOTUS a gift. Wow, that’s front page news!! Give me a break.
February 10, 2019 at 1:03 am
Michelle Obama was the most disgraceful First Lady America has had to endure.  She can’t hold a candle the Melania Trump.  She is a disgruntled has-been like her husband.  If she can’t say something nice, she ought to shut up, all she accomplishs is showing her butt.
February 10, 2019 at 1:05 am
Some people have grace and class. Then with some people no matter how high up the ladder they try to climb you just can’t get the slime and smell of the gutter off them. They wouldn’t know grace and class if you slapped them up side the head with it. Just proves why the White House is looking so much better since they took out the trash
February 10, 2019 at 4:22 am
I couldn’t have said it any better kudos to you.
February 10, 2019 at 2:18 pm
Good comment.  No one cares any longer what Michelle thinks (as if we ever did), so stop these disgraceful stories.  Stop keeping them in the spotlight! We don’t care!!!!
February 10, 2019 at 1:07 am
Michelle O. is acting like a  child. Very disappointed in her actions, but not surprised. Melania is a lady and you would never hear that sarcasm from her. Perhaps Michelle needs some classes in manners.
February 10, 2019 at 1:09 am
Moochelle is a classless Dude!He looked like he just finished scrubbing the Whitehouse toilets on Inauguration day.What a pig!
February 10, 2019 at 1:21 am
CLASS,that is the one word that neither Michael or Barack ever knew anything about.They are two low life individuals that were carried into office ONLY because people did not want to be called racist.I doubt that Michael knows the difference between a cardboard box and a Tiffany box.Ignorant is as ignorant does.He proved my point.To say that they were on a late night show proves that they did not want it to be in the day time where people could have a real opinion.I still think they should both have too o and live in the slums of Haiti so they would be brought down to their true level.
Once again Obama shows just how little class she has.
February 10, 2019 at 1:24 am
So low class  consider the source I suppose.  Melanie puts her to shame.
Michele has no class.
February 10, 2019 at 1:27 am
Sometimes you can take the girl out of the ghetto but not the ghetto out of the girl. Michelle is about as low class as it gets.
February 10, 2019 at 1:27 am
Michael needs to just go away & shut her face un-American greedy pig
Who is this Tranny anyways?
February 10, 2019 at 1:31 am
What irritates and angers me the most about the Obama’s, is when I heard
her speak at a college graduation, and a town hall, and all it was, was
a story of racism, divide and suppression.
Then, I hear Denzel Washington do a motivational speech at a high school
and a college graduation. Night and day my friends, night and day.
Listening to anything OTHER than “look how I did it!”, or empowering rhetoric,
is just terrible. It’s like Michael Jordan whining and complaining about all
the bad calls he got, and the missed jumpers he took. With his success, who cares.
He should just be talking about how high he (or you) can fly when you work hard for it.
And how fortunate he is, and how YOU can do it too.
The elite snobs in this country…..Hard to explain and digest.
February 10, 2019 at 1:35 am
SORRY BUT  MY OPINION. SHE ACTS JUST LIKE THE NIGGER THAT SHE IS. NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO EVEN MMENTION MELANAI’S NAME
February 10, 2019 at 6:59 am
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT Jean Craig! Don’t apologize…it’s the honest truth!
February 10, 2019 at 8:14 am
Stupid, ignorant, person she is Jean. You hit the nail on the head.
February 10, 2019 at 1:43 am
Believe me, the feeling is mutual. For a lot of us patriots, those two couldn’t leave fast enough! Now, please sit down and just fade away. You’ve done enough damage already.
February 10, 2019 at 1:51 am
If it was “Bye Felicia” then why is she still talking?
February 10, 2019 at 1:53 am
At least Melania is female.  No doubt about that.  She actually gave birth to a baby and there are records and pictures.  Michelle, actually Michael LeVaughn Robinson, is a man with a penis and all.  Total fraud and a disgrace.
February 10, 2019 at 2:08 am
And the government put them in that office. And now the Congress is doing its damndest to get President Trump out of that office. Stand by, all hell hasn’t broke loose yet.
February 10, 2019 at 1:57 am
Bye Felicia as in obama you are and never have been of any importance..you and your husband and daughters are nothing more than sewer rats that need to be exterminated..thank God for the Trumps..true Americans unlike yourself and that corrupt husband of yours..you are what give the black race a bad name
now just disappear back to the ghetto from where you whence you came
RK….WELL STATED MY FRIEND! I couldn’t agree more!
February 10, 2019 at 1:57 am
Don’t understand why Michelle is so ugly about this when she did the same thing for Laura Bush.
February 10, 2019 at 2:25 am
Michelle, see this video and note the grace of Laura Bush receiving your gift.  Take a lesson, and learn some class.
February 10, 2019 at 3:58 am
Yes, Carrie, I so agree! When she did the same for Laura Bush, Laura managed that whole “calamity” without even breaking a sweat. She just handed it off to someone else, I’m sure. Michelle is just a drama queen…
February 10, 2019 at 5:17 am
You are absolutely right. Michelle did the same thing to Laura Bush. Funny how Michelle forgot she did the same thing Melania did but Laura Bush handled it gracefully and with class.
Fukin sub human ape bitch
Correctly stated maddog!
I’ don’t understand Michelle Obama’s confusion and her constantly harping on the gift, when she  presented the same type Tiffany box to Laura Bush when she entered the White House.  She knows the Tiffany gift is a tradition for First Ladies. https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/02/01/photo-michelle-brought-laura-a-gift-in-2009/ With all her taxpayer travels, does she not have something positive to talk about?
“Big Mike” is ghetto through and through………….
February 10, 2019 at 2:27 am
Michael…Michael…Melania is three times the woman ,Moochelle tries to be…how many languages do you speak Moochelle …two ? broken English and getto?….where is your /Obozo’s law license???…gave them up BEFORE they took them….huh
Somebody is really jealous
Something from my cats litterbox would have been good too. 
February 10, 2019 at 2:35 am
Michelle is that piece of gum that gets stuck on a shoe.  Ruins everything she touches.
February 10, 2019 at 2:46 am
Michelle Obama has not class whatsoever.  Melania Trump has all the class plus she is an intelligent woman.  Nothing like ghetto Michelle.
February 10, 2019 at 2:53 am
For a phony, ugly, lying piece of trash who half the country thinks looks like a gorilla and the other half isn’t even sure it’s not a man, she’s in no position to cast insults at anyone. She’s nothing but an ignorant dirt bag, just like that sniveling traitor of a husband of hers.
Yes indeed Oscar! All true!
February 10, 2019 at 2:55 am
One more thing….Jackass Michelle is also very JEALOUS  of beautiful , classy. Melania….Very obvious!!  She knows she isn’t half the woman Melania is…and history will prove that !!!  ANYWAY,   MICHELLE LOOKS MORE LIKE A MAN ….her husband looks more like a woman…Who knows what they are ?????
February 10, 2019 at 3:13 am
mrs obama was not really pretty  and a horrible dresser no class   untill she got money to get a much needed make over and yes she is jealous of mrs trump natural beauty and style ugly inside human
February 10, 2019 at 3:18 am
mrs obama is jealous of mrs trumps natural beauty and style of dress she was horrible untill she got money for her makeover and thosemrs obama is jealous of mrs trumps natural beauty and style of dress she was horrible untill she got money for her make scars do not leave
February 10, 2019 at 3:23 am
Mrs O is one more UNGRATFUL person,I will not even call her a lady. A real lady would go out of her way to uplift the First Lady no matter who or how she really felt about her.
February 10, 2019 at 3:29 am
THAT QUEER SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THE WHITEHOUSE TO BEGIN WITH OR HIS BOYTOY BARRY!!!
February 10, 2019 at 3:59 am
Michelle just proved again, what a tactless, graceless individual she is.  She couldn’t just say it was a frame and be done with it.
February 10, 2019 at 4:35 am
Michelle is a liar.  She doesn’t “go high”!!  Frankly, I’m tired of hearing about the present. Old news and Michelle could have very simply accepted the gift and returned it later if she felt uncomfortable accepting it.  That would have been the “high road”.  Somehow, hearing the story (again) 2 years later simple to bash Melania, isn’t anywhere near the “high road”.  I guess the altitude was too much for Michelle and she just tumbled off.
February 10, 2019 at 4:39 am
She was on a late night show, what else would you expect from those no class shows. I sure miss the old late show hosts. Now they had class.
February 10, 2019 at 4:54 am
Michelle just showed what gutter trash really is. Hope I didn’t insult gutter trash.
February 10, 2019 at 5:31 am
And this is shocking news? This low life has and always will be a hateful, ungrateful, racist POS. She is ugly inside as well as outside. This is the first time, since 2008, that I have been proud of my country. For eight long years it was all I could do to stay here and endure that family inhabiting our White House. They were worse than a pack of baboons at the zoo and 2016 couldn’t get here fast enough. Thanks to the Trump family our country is finally getting back to what she was and I pray everyday that they will reside in our White House for another term. KAG, 2020!
February 10, 2019 at 5:33 am
I have always thought Moochelle looked like an NFL linebacker. There is a saying that you can put lipstick on a pig (like Moochelle), but it is still a pig. I have my doubts that she is a female, at least in the normal sense. Bath house Barry is a disgrace as an American. He was always on a bow down and apologize tour in every country he visited. As a couple, they did more to destroy the standing of this country in eight years than all of our other presidents  combined have done since 1776.
I imagine Melania was thinking “Bye Felicia” herself. hahahaha
February 10, 2019 at 6:17 am
I guess Michelle has never heard of etiquette.  That would explain why she was so surprised by it.
February 10, 2019 at 7:25 am
Michelle has always been ugly  trash.  That’s why she’s so jealous of beautiful, classy women.   She can’t compete.
February 10, 2019 at 8:33 am
I think I’ll reserve my comments until after the military tribunal in which Barry & Michael Obama are, at this very moment, on trial for regarding several changes, of which, treason, espionage, child sex trafficking & many more charges have been brought against them…after the execution of both of them, I will be more than happy to comment on their horrendous behavior in the White House & after…Barrack Obama will be stripped of the office of President of the United States, immediately following his conviction & execution…wait & see…
February 10, 2019 at 1:00 pm
who cares what this tranny trash had to say. Fallon is a low-class piece of garbage.
February 10, 2019 at 1:35 pm
Figures. First First Lady who left office to every critize any of the First Ladies let alone the present one. Just shows what she really is like. I never did care for her. I could see it right from the beginning. Well she feels she has to fit in with the rest of the classless asses. Was she also wearing white?
February 10, 2019 at 1:45 pm
NIGGER MAN IS AS NIGGER MAN DOES..YO! FUCK MOOCH THE HAIRY MAN BEAST NIGGER
February 10, 2019 at 2:58 pm
She is the meaning of the saying “you can’t make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear.” She had her mother living with her for 8 years, one would think that a woman who used to be a school teacher, would tell her what was class and dignity and what was trashy and low brow.
she’s just fcking jealous
February 10, 2019 at 4:35 pm
Oh my God how racist these Amercan people can be. And than they called themselves God feering  what a joke. That’s why the rest of the world think of you as ignorant.
February 10, 2019 at 4:53 pm
He, She, It, what ever you want to Call Obama’s Mate, is irrelevant!  He is a disgusted Lower Eastside Thug, and no degree or the fact that he is an attorney matters!  Plain and simple, he has no idea how to be gracious, or how to accept a gift!  I am so glad that they are gone from our lives and our White House!
February 10, 2019 at 8:56 pm
AS LOW As it gets , and LOWER !! She will never never measure up to Melania !!
February 10, 2019 at 10:48 pm
Just goes to show what a low class fat assed ghetto pig Michele Obama really is
Michelle who?
February 11, 2019 at 2:43 am
You rapid rightwing are ridiculous just as this article is.  Michelle Obama has more class the naked model could ever dream of having.  Try not listening to Coulter, Limbaugh and Hannity! And believing your info from sites like this
February 11, 2019 at 3:06 am
What else would expect from a low class HE/SHE in a dress!  “BYE  MANSHELL!”
Melanie is a whore
February 19, 2019 at 3:03 am
Her name is Melania.  This isn’t GONE WITH THE WIND.
February 11, 2019 at 3:59 pm
Michelle is as classless and ugly as the democrat party she represents
February 11, 2019 at 4:53 pm
I just blow it off considering the source.  Why would you expect anything less from a classless person?  It takes class to recognize class.
February 11, 2019 at 5:45 pm
OH HORRORS!!!! Michelle received a gift and can’t leave it in the car on the way to the inauguration?? I know they didn’t walk, so unless she was on her F’ing broomstick that day, leaving it in the car was a problem….why? What a cow.
My mom would never buy a house thats 2nd hand.
I can’t imagine what it was like for Trump, who’s a germophobe, to move into the white house… after the Obama’s and the Clintons with his sex with interns every where.
I hope they brought in a hazmat team.
February 18, 2019 at 4:36 am
It’s obvious Michael, the Tranny is jealous of REAL WOMEN !
February 19, 2019 at 5:00 pm
She said that because she knew her husband would continue his anti American relationship with Iran, China, and other enemies of the nation, and along with his pal John Kerry, would continue working against the American way of life, in favor of a dictatorship that would keep people like him in life of luxury, and untouchable, while real Americans suffer as a result of his actions & decisions.
