Bruce Springsteen has continued his attacks on Donald Trump, this time criticising his immigration ban during a show in Australia.
Introducing the song American Land at a show in Adelaide on 30 January, Springsteen said: “Tonight we wanted to add our voices to the thousands of Americans who are protesting in airports around our country the Muslim ban and detention of foreign nationals and refugees.”
He continued: “America is a nation of immigrants, and we find this anti-democratic and fundamentally un-American.”

It’s far from the first time Springsteen has spoken out against Trump. He has previously branded him a “moron” and, during an interview with the Guardian , mocked his fragile sense of masculinity. “It’s the thinnest possible mask of masculinity. And it wouldn’t fool anybody from the Greatest Generation,” he said.
Springsteen was joined in his condemnation of the announced temporary US travel ban by other musicians, including Rihanna , Green Day’s Billie Joe Armstrong and John Legend. Most notable, perhaps, was Queens of the Stone Age ’s Josh Homme who took to Instagram to label Trump a “shallow, inept, multi-bankrupt declaring, narcissistic, narrow-minded, out of touch, objectifying, barf-inducing, fascist, clown penis ... who also happens to be re-stup-redicu-lame”.
