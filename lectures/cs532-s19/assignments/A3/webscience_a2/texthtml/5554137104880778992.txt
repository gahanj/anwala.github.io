There is a scene in the movie âGallipoliâ in which two young lads from Australia trek across the Outback to enlist on the side of the British during World War I.
They encounter a wizened old guy who asks them why they would want to go halfway around the world to fight.
âIf we don't stop them there, they could end up here,â one of the lads responds.
The old guy looks around the barren landscape and responds, âAnd they're welcome to it.â
I thought of that after President Trumpâs State of the Union speech in which he assailed âfoolish warsâ and also proclaimed that âgreat nations do not fight endless wars.â
Of the cost of such wars, Trump has said, âWe have spent $7 trillion, trillion with a T, $7 trillion in the Middle East."
In fact, we havenât spent that all yet, but itâs a reasonable estimate of the cost over 30 years, according to PolitiFact.
Those wars were certainly foolish. As for endless, weâre still bogged down in Afghanistan after 17 years and Syria after seven.
Most normal human beings support getting out. But like lad in that movie, the Beltway intelligentsia can always find a justification for war.
Typical was an appearance on National Public Radio by Tony Blinken, who held national-security posts in the Clinton and Obama administrations.
After clearing his throat with âI think the president reflects a desire across the board in the United States to pull back from what some people call forever wars,â Blinken went on to warn against pulling out of Syria and Afghanistan too precipitously.
In Syria, Blinken said, âhe's undercut the success of his own policy and the policy of President Obama by this impulsive withdrawal of the 2,000 Special Forces that we had in Syria precisely to keep a foot on ISIS' throat.â
Impulsive? Trumpâs been saying the Syrian intervention was a failure for four years, even though he increased the number of troops there after promising to wipe out ISIS. Heâs made similar comments about Afghanistan, where the Taliban resurgence has inspired Trump to order a gradual withdrawal of the 14,000 troops there.
The problem with having feet on throats is that you have to take them off sooner or later. Here again the story of Gallipoli is instructive. Gallipoli is in Turkey, which was the center of the Ottoman Empire. It was part of the Axis in World War I. The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps â ANZAC for short â was ordered by British officers to mount a suicidal charge into well-entrenched Turk machine guns. They were repulsed and suffered 10,000 dead and 25,000 wounded.
More than a century later, the Aussies and the Kiwis still air their grudge against the Brits on ANZAC day, a national holiday. Meanwhile Turkey is once again controlled by Islamists and is back to what looks like an effort to restore the Ottoman Empire.
Whatever else you think of Trump, you should appreciate his efforts to point out how both parties have cooperated in making a mess of the Mideast.
Itâs true that he has some crazies in his administration. But as long as Trump takes his own advice heâll be in good shape on the foreign-policy front.
As for the Democrats, not so much. They are as divided on foreign policy as they were back in 2016, when peace activists by the thousands rallied outside the Philadelphia convention to protest Hillary Clintonâs foreign policy positions.
That warâs already breaking out on forums such as the Daily Kos website. A recent posting attacked New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, who has declared for the Democratic presidential nomination. The author slams Booker for his close ties to the AIPAC, the American Israeli Political Action Committee, which takes a hard line on the Palestinians.
Peace activists prefer J-Street, a lobby that calls for a peaceful two-state solution to that particular endless war.
The article notes that Booker is very close to Shmuley Boteach , the Bergen County rabbi who in 2016 r2n as a Republican against liberal Democratic U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell, charging that Pascrell was soft on the Palestinians.
The author concludes with this: âWhen the war hyenas are again circling, and again trying to foment war, against North Korea, against Iran, against Syria, we dare not allow the Democratic party, which should stand in opposition to those evil forces, to be co-opted and detoured by a smooth-talking wolf in sheepâs clothing who sings the song of progressive ideals but hides an agenda of war and conquest.â
Booker is a skilled debater, and I canât wait to hear how he handles this in the Democratic primary debates. One of the participants will be the fervently antiwar U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, an Iraq War vet who has outraged the pro-war lobby by visiting President Bashar al-Assad in Syria to discuss a peaceful settlement.
Peace? But if we donât fight them over there, theyâll be over here.
Or the Outback.
