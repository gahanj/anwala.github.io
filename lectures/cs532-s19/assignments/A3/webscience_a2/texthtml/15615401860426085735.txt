Donald Trump Gives A Motivational Speech at Mexico University
No, it wasnâ€™t really at a university in Mexico but it is a real speech that he gave in 2004. In a 2004 unearthed video, President Trump urges graduates to never let a wall get in their way during a commencement speech at Wagner College in Staten Island, N.Y. How ironic . . . and funny!
