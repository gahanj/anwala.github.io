Satire: the use of humour, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.
After hearing trump talk about the wall he wants to build and charge another country for, i thought i would share my satirical thoughts. who else built a wall..
The chinese.. the great wall of china
The romans.. hadrians wall
The israelis .. to cut off palestine
now trump with the mexican wall.
these are not quotes but a fictional satire.. except the wall building and the mexicans saying they will not pay for it
