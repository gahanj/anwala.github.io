Huawei has been in hot water lately â€” governments around the world are banning its network equipment, it allegedly tried to steal technology for 'diamond glass' screens , and its CFO has been charged with wire fraud and conspiracy . A report from Politico claims that the White House is preparing to sign an executive order that would ban U.S. carriers from using Chinese telecom equipment, including products from Huawei.
The report claims that President Trump is expected to sign an executive order, possibly as soon as this coming week, that would ban the use of Chinese telecom equipment by U.S. carriers. The ban would primarily target Huawei and ZTE. Sources told Politico that the White House wants the executive order signed before this month's Mobile World Congress, which starts on February 25 in Barcelona.
Government officials are mainly targeting Huawei and ZTE's network infrastructure business, so the sale of phones and tablets to U.S. consumers would likely not be affected.
Yes.
