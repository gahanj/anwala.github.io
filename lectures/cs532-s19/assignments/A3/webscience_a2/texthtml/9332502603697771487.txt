South Korea's presidential office says it will be in close touch with officials in the U.S. ahead of President Trump's summit later this month in Vietnam with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
The Blue House spokesperson says presidents Moon and Trump might speak on the phone in the coming days.
The spokesperson also hinted at further discussions on multiple levels between Seoul and Washington, some between their top diplomats as well as between their national security chiefs Chung Eui-yong and John Bolton.
More working-level talks between North Korea and the U.S. have also been confirmed in the lead-up to the second Kim-Trump summit.
