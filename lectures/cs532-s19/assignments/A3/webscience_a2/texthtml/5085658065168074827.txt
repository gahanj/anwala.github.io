Trump Appears to Make Trail of Tears Joke in Tweet Mocking Elizabeth Warren
President Trump took to Twitter Saturday to respond to Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) official 2020 presidential announcement, mocking her controversial claims of Native American ancestry in the process. The president also joked on Twitter that he would “see [Warren] on the campaign TRAIL,” an apparent reference to the Trail of Tears, which led to the deaths of thousands of Native Americans. “Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore?” Trump wrote, mocking the candidate’s claims of Native American ancestry . During her announcement speech earlier in the day, Warren said it would not be enough “to just undo the terrible acts of this administration, we can’t afford to just tinker around the edges—a tax credit here, a regulation there. Our fight is for big, structural change.” Warren joins a slew of Democratic contenders that hope to reinvigorate the party.
