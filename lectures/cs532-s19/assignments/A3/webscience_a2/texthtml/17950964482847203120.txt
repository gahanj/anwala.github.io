Minaj says when it comes to the former “Celebrity Apprentice” star's entertainment factor, “I think he’s hilarious.
“I wish they could just film him running for president,” Minaj adds, “That’s the ultimate reality show.”
But the chart-topper, who’s been dubbed a “female rap trailblazer,” isn’t ready to throw her support behind any 2016 White House bid.
When asked to weigh in on Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, Minaj says, “I support her as a woman. Am I convinced that she should be the next president? I still want to be open-minded about everyone.”
The 33-year-old performer, who was born in Trinidad and Tobago, continues of the former secretary of State, “Obviously, I identify with her struggles as a woman. I identify with the fact that when she’s in that room and there are nothing but men there — there’s sometimes something in her that must feel intimidated.
“But I think that she uses that and turns it into a strength. Because that’s what I’ve always done. And so I love her for sticking it out.”
Minaj adds that Clinton “has gone through horrifying things, even within her marriage. She has been brave and weathered the storm. And continued being a boss. That’s something that every woman should feel inspired by, no matter if you’re voting for her or not.”
