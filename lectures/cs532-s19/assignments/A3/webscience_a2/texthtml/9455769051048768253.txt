On Tuesday, Democrats won back the House for the first time in eight years, while the Republicans maintained control of the Senate. The future of the House Financial Services Commitee was just one of the issues  FOX Business   tracked around the midterms.
“I fear that she will use this as a tool to harass the administration, to really grind down the deregulation -- the deregulatory efforts of the administration,” Hensarling, who currently chairs the committee, said to FOX Business’ Stuart Varney on Monday before the midterm results. “So it’s bad, really bad for economic growth.”
Hensarling added that Waters, a vocal critic of banks and their bailout programs, could create more red tape as the committee’s head.
“My fear is she’ll rubber-stamp subpoenas to all of the appointees of the president in the financial arena and… demand documents and appearances before Congress and really you know -- a harassment effort,” he said.
President Trump in a tweet on Saturday warned voters that a Democratic takeover in the upcoming midterm elections would put Waters in charge of the country’s finances. “Beginning of the end!” he warned.

Waters, during a weekend interview on MSNBC, was asked about Trump’s campaign and said, “The President of the United States of America is placing a target on my back.”
Last week FOX Business’s Charlie Gasparino reported that people close with Waters say she would have a “constructive relationship” with banks and would instead focus on the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
