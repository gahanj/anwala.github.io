Nancy Pelosi has already pledged to support the results coming from the conference committee, and with word leaking that the results are going to include some funding for barriers of any sort, some legislators are already grumbling about the outcome. However, the committee includes Progressive Caucus member Lucille Roybal-Allard and Hispanic Caucus member Henry Cuellar, suggesting that any bill is unlikely to contain more than a token gesture toward “a wall.”
According to the New York Times , Democrats on the committee are also worried about losing votes because the bill apparently doesn’t cut funding for ICE, which was a key concern for some legislators.  However, if Democrats have agreed to approximately $2 billion in funding for border security, and for sustaining the previously allocated level of funds for related items, it seems likely that they got something in exchange.
That something is … unknown. The conference committee has been fairly air tight during its two weeks of negotiations, and the details of the bills it’s writing remain unclear. However, it does seem that one of the bills is specifically for disaster funding, so one of the things Democrats may have obtained is insurance that funding for disaster relief is allocated in a way that keeps it out of Trump’s hands, even if he should decide to declare a non-emergency emergency at some point.
What’s absolutely clear is that Republicans have absolutely no stomach for another shutdown at this point, and the previous shutdown burned up the bulk of Trump’s political capital on Capitol Hill. Republicans don’t want a shutdown. They don’t want an emergency declaration. They just want this over with. So, despite grumbling, it seems all but certain that they will sign on with anything that emerges from the committee. And so will Trump. 
Then he’ll spend the next 12 months claiming he got his wall. So long as that wall is a lot shorter, a lot flimsier, and is really just short stretches of fence in areas where there already was fence.
