In his upcoming book, fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe accuses President Trump of unleashing a “strain of insanity” in U.S. politics, and claims that he forced Deputy AG to justify the sacking of FBI Director James Comey.
McCabe’s book, titled “The Threat: How The FBI Protects America In The Age Of Terror And Trump,” is due for release on February 19.
Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired Andrew McCabe just 26 hours short of his eligibility to retire with pension, saying that Comey’s former right-hand man “lacked candor” in an investigation into media leaks.
The fired FBI official claims in his book that a “glassy-eyed” Rod Rosenstein was emotional and upset in a May 12, 2017 meeting, saying that Trump had forced him to write the memo that justified Comey’s firing.
“He said it wasn’t his idea. The president had ordered him to write the memo justifying the firing,” McCabe wrote. 
“Rosenstein said he was having trouble sleeping,” he added.
“There’s no one here that I can trust,” Rosenstein is quoted as saying.
Rosenstein has publicly defended his memo, which said that the “reputation and credibility” of the FBI had been damaged under Comey’s tenure, citing the Hillary Clinton email investigation.
Andrew McCabe also compared the president to a mob boss for trying to pressure his loyalty after firing James Comey.
“The president and his men were trying to work me the way a criminal brigade would operate,” McCabe wrote.
He added that Trump’s “heedless bullying” and intolerance for other viewpoints is “nurturing a strain of insanity in public dialogue.’
