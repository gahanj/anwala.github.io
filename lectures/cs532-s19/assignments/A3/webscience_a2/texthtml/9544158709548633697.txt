There's only one way for the Mad-Orange-Munchkin to keep his hair that "beautiful and high class" shade of lustrous yellow! He has to catch the golden showers outside of the Kremlin.
As he says, the golden showers in Moscow are "yugely the best and strongest," every drop is "incredibly big and incredibly wet!"
If he runs out of yellow in his hair... well, he'll just gets "tired of winning," that's all. You'll have to start over and see how long you can keep the pompadour yellow.
(Enjoy the parody, enjoy the nonsense, or not. Your call.)
