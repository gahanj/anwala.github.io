Rats have Los Angeles City Hall on the run
Los Angeles officials are ripping out carpets, setting traps and fumigating as they battle a rat infestation at City Hall that one attorney says left her battling a bout of typhus.
The historic building, located in the downtown area, has apparently been overrun with rodents after a nearby structure was demolished last year.
The rat problem has escalated to the extent that Herb Wesson, the city council president, submitted a motion calling for an inquiry into “the scope of vermin and pest control issues” in the building and adjacent structures.
Seven terrorists get life for attacks on tourists
A Tunisian court has sentenced seven jihadists to life in prison over attacks at a museum and on a beach that killed 60 people, including British tourists.
Dozens of defendants faced two separate trials over the shootings, which occurred in Tunis and Sousse, but many were acquitted.
Four were sentenced to life for the rampage at a Sousse tourist resort in June 2015, which killed 38 people, and three were given life sentences for the Tunis museum attack in March 2015.
