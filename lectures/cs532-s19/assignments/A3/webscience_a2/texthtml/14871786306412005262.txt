One election analyst says President Trump does not need 50% of the national vote to win a second term in office.
In an interview Friday, Henry Olsen of the Washington Post said the president realistically needs just 47% to win re-election.

Olsen went on to say in the past election, the president won over 50% in critical swing states, and if he sees the same support this time around, he would easily secure his win in the Electoral College.
“The thing is, the president doesn’t need 50% to win. Opposition to him is so concentrated IN large blue states if he’s at 47% on Election Day, he’s at over 50 percent in every swing state, including Arizona and Michigan, and he’s going to win reelection,” said Olsen. “If he’s at 47 percent in the RealClearPolitics average, he’s going to win reelection because he’ll be at over 50 in the Electoral College. He might lose the popular vote by a point or two, but he’ll win the Electoral College.”
Reports also show President Trump’s funding on his re-election campaign has far exceeded his Democrat opponents.
