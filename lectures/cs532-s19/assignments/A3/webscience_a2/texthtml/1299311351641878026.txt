FISH STICKS! Yeah Trump is serving the Russians on this too.
How Trump's trade war kept Russian fish sticks in US school lunchrooms
Washington (CNN)A trade decision by the Trump administration has inadvertently protected a price advantage enjoyed by Russian-caught fish sold in the US, much of which ends up in fish sticks served to American school children.
For years, Alaskan fishermen have been frustrated by foreign competition from Russia, particularly in the lucrative pollock market. Caught in Russian waters, this cold-water cousin of the cod is processed in China before being sold in the US for use in frozen and breaded fish products, as well as imitation crab meat.
Russian pollock costs less than its US-caught equivalent. That's helped it gain share of the roughly $200 million US market for frozen pollock, to the point that by 2017, about half the fish sticks served in US school cafeterias were made from fish caught in Russia and pumped with additives in China, according to the Genuine Alaska Pollock Producers, a trade group that represents 14 different seafood companies.
Neither US Foods nor Sysco, two of the largest food services companies in the United States, responded directly to questions about whether they provide Russian-caught pollock to school lunch programs.

1. Oh, I'm sure it's TOTALLY inadvertent, CNN ... good call ... (nt)
Which helps
5. School lunch fish sticks can be handy. I used one to dig a tunnel out of study hall once.
6. How long will it be before Trump makes a deal with Japan for making sticks with their whale meat?
The last of the world's whales will be completely extinct, and we won't have to worry about begging Japan and Norway to stop killing them.
Thanks, underpants, for this article we might have missed otherwise. It's just hideous, like Trump's other handiwork.
7. What French Kids Eat For School Lunch (It Puts Americans To Shame!)
I found this while I was looking for an online article I read about French school lunches. Note: no Russo/Chinese additive-filled fish sticks on the menu.
"There are many theories as to why the French, and French children in particular, do not suffer from weight problems, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension like their American counterparts. Eating moderate quantities of fresh and freshly prepared food at set times of the day is definitely one of the most convincing reasons why they stay lean. Daily exercise, in the form of three recess periods (two 15-minute and one 60-minute recess every day) and walking or biking to and from school, is another.
So what do French kids eat at school?
Menus are set up two months in advance by the cantine management staff, and then sent to a certified dietitian who makes small �corrections.� The dietitian might take out a small chocolate �clair and replace it with a kiwi for dessert if she thinks there's too much sugar that week. Or she may modify suggested menus by adding more or fewer carbohydrates, vegetables, fruits, or protein to keep the balance right.
Almost all foods are prepared right in the kitchen; they�re not ready-made frozen. This means mashed potatoes, most desserts, salads, soups, and certainly the main dishes are prepared daily. Treats are included � the occasional slice of tarte, a dollop of ice cream, a delicacy from the local pastry shop. Check out these photos of a school lunch being prepared on premises.
Below are photos and a description of one week�s worth of school menus, taken during the last few weeks of this school year in June. French elementary school students don't go to school on Wednesdays, so that's why there are only four meals!"
