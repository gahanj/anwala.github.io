Former Obama administration health official Ronald Klain, who served as the U.S. Ebola response coordinator in 2014, blasted President Donald Trump’s second annual physical health exam via Twitter.
After Trump underwent a thorough physical examination at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday, the president’s personal physician Dr. Sean Conley declared he was in “very good health” and “will remain so for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond.”
Although, Conley, who's also the current director of the White House medical unit, didn’t reveal any results from the four-hour examination which was led by a team of 11 specialists, he did mention that “reports and recommendations are being finalized.”
“No doctor can predict someone’s future health,” Klain tweeted in response to Conley’s statement on Saturday. “This is a disgrace to an office with a great tradition of professionalism. Just another institution turned into a joke by a President determined to make anyone willing to submit an instrument of his lies.”
