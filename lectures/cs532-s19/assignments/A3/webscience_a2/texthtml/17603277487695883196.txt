Trump resurrects "Pocahontas" insult for Warren's 2020 launch
President Trump took to Twitter on Saturday to blast Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's official entrance into the 2020 Democratic presidential race, resurrecting his "Pocahontas" nickname and musing if she would run as "our first Native American presidential candidate."
"Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!"
The big picture: Warren has faced early speed bumps over her past claims of Native American ancestry, and Trump takes particular delight in his offensive nickname, as Axios' Jonathan Swan reported last year . The president's personal focus on Warren is also highlighted by the fact that he failed to tweet after other high-profile campaign launches from Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker.
