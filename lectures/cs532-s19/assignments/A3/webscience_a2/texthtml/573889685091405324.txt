Why it was such a good week in Trumpworld
Opinion: Why it was such a good week in Trumpworld: You won’t be surprised to hear that President Donald Trump raved about the news on the economy Friday. The news was good, all right. Growth was 4.1% in the last quarter, a strong number, though nothing near the masterpiece of economic management Trump claimed to have achieved.
For those of us who believe that Trump’s policies present a tangible threat to democracy — and America’s standing in the world — the week flashed glimmers of light over the horizon, writes Frida Ghitis.
