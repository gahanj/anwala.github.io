*******     Hey KAG Swagger!      *******
Please keep in mind that almost EVERY product is available in a variety of colors so if you see a style you like  but in the "wrong" color check it out anyway - there's probably an option more to your liking.
If you’d like a specific color combination of any product, please let me know and I’ll do my best to make it happen. Want a KAG! / Keep America Great / Trump 2020 hat or shirt in your favorite team colors? I can probably hook that up for you. Send a note with the details and I’ll see what I can do.
New products and designs are coming every day so be sure to check back often for snazzy getKAGswag apparel and accessories. And please spread the word to your friends, family and neighbors if you like what you see.
If you have any questions, comments or suggestions please feel free hit me up and let me know what’s what. I’d love to hear from you.
Thanks for your interest and your support. It’s very much appreciated!
Take it easy…and KAG!
