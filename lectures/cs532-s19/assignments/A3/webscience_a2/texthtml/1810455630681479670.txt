Soon, President Donald Trump's most fervent supporters can own the ultimate piece of commander-in-chief memorabilia: his boyhood home in Queens, NY. That sure beats "Make America Great" hats and "#BuildTheWall" T-shirts, eh?
The president's five-bedroom, 4.5-bathroom  childhood home in Jamaica Estates, a tony enclave in Queens, hit the market on Monday. With a $2.9 million price tag, the 2,500-square-foot Tudor is the third highest-priced home listed on realtor.com® in its ZIP code. The real estate developer-turned-politician would likely approve.
The appeal of Trump's former home is simple.
"It's the birthplace of Donald Trump," says Compass real estate agent Edward Hickey, who is representing the property. "It's listed on his birth certificate, and that adds a lot of value for some people."

The brick and stucco house, which features a library, finished basement, and enclosed patio, is no longer owned by the Trump family and isn't affiliated with the Trump Organization. Its current owner, listed simply as the Trump Birth House LLC, has been renting out the property on Airbnb for about $700 a night. The listing, which is no longer available, featured a life-size, cardboard cutout and copies of Trump's book "The Art of the Deal."
The owner of the home hopes to close within the next two weeks, says Hickey. Interested buyers can view the property here and should email  TrumpBirthHouse@gmail.com  with proof of funds to schedule a showing. Only all-cash offers will be accepted.
"We just don't want it to become a circus," says Hickey.

The president lived in the home, constructed in 1940, until he was about 4. Then his family moved around the corner into a three-story, 23-room McMansion that the president's father, real estate developer Fred C. Trump, built around 1950. The larger residence is visible from the previous home's backyard.
