Mexico’s former president shared some choice words for President Donald Trump , describing the American leader as a “machine” with “no compassion” while at the World Government Summit in Dubai on Sunday.
he told CNBC in April of last year. That’s for sure. And why should we?”
With no success in getting Mexico to pay for the wall, which is expected to cost in the tens of billions, Trump has since shifted his plan to one that requires U.S. government funding for its construction. He argues the infrastructure is necessary for America’s national security and critical in combating drug flows into the country. The battle over wall funding, which congressional Democrats oppose, led to the longest government shutdown in the nation’s history.
Since the beginning of Trump’s candidacy and well after his inauguration, Fox has pulled no punches in letting the world know what he thinks. He’s called Trump “crazy,” “ignorant,” and said that “every Mexican is united against Trump.” The former public servant served as chief executive of Coca-Cola Mexico in the 1970s, having started his work at the drinks company in 1964 as a delivery truck driver.
Trump ran on a campaign to put “America First,” claiming that other countries had been abusing the U.S.’s goodwill and financial support for too long. He has often said, however, that “America first does not mean America alone,” seemingly vacillating between an isolationist stance and one that encourages greater cooperation among countries. Critics argue that his frequent disparaging of allies like the European Union and Mexico only serve to alienate the world’s largest economy.
