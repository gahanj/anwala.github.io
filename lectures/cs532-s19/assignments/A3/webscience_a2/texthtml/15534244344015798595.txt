Buzzfeed’s unethical publishing of an unverified dossier alleging numerous salacious acts committed by President Donald Trump angered CNN anchor Jake Tapper.
Emails released as part of a lawsuit reveal the CNN anchor told Buzzfeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith that publishing the document “makes the story less serious and credible” and “damaged its impact,” according to a review of the emails by The Daily Caller’s Chuck Ross.
So, reporting on the unverified document from the angle that the president-elect was briefed on it was fine, but publishing the unverified document “damaged its impact.”
“That was pretty uncollegial[.] Not to mention irresponsible[.] No one has verified this stuff,” Tapper wrote Smith in an email on January 10, 2017.
CNN had run a story about President-Elect Donald Trump being briefed on parts of the dossier, and used that to bring the unverified gossip document into the nation’s attention. Shortly after the CNN report, Buzzfeed published the dossier in full, which had been circulating among newsrooms for the months prior, but wasn’t published because no one could verify any of its claims. But reporting on it from the angle that Trump was briefed on the dossier allowed the media to get around that problem.
