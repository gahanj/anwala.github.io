President Trump has his bad days and his…well, not exactly what you’d call good days, but some days that are better than others. On his better days, he’s still as racist and idiotic as ever, but he at least manages some coherence. On his bad days, he slurs his words and struggles to so much as string a thought together. If he weren’t such a detestable individual one might even feel sorry for him on such days, when he looks like exactly what he is: a senile old man losing his mental facilities one sputtered word at a time.
Today appears to be one of the president’s bad days. While giving an address at the National Prayer Breakfast — because for some reason there are still swathes of the country engaged in the collective delusion that Trump is a religious man — Trump made a major teleprompter gaffe while touting the role that faith has played in this country’s past achievements.
While at face value it looks like a simple slip of the tongue, one can’t help but feel unsettled watching the video. This man is entrusted with running the most powerful nation in the world and is handily defeated by something as basic as a teleprompter. His mind is constantly scattered and his cognitive skills are in decline.
Rampant criminality and corruption aside, this man is mentally unfit to serve. He must go.
Watch the video below.
