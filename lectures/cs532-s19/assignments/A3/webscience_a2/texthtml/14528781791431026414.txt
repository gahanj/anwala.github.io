President Donald Trump reportedly tells visitors on tours of the White house that former President Barack Obama spent his time watching sports.
Sources told The Washington Post that the president would give impromptu talks to visitors and said that Obama would watch basketball all day in a private dining room near the Oval Office.
“He just sat in here and watched basketball all day,” Trump reportedly said. He added that the room was in “rough shape” and had a hole in it when he moved in after his inauguration in 2017.
An Obama official denied the claim to the Post, adding that the former president never watched basketball in the dining room and there was no hole in the room.
Social media users have criticized Trump’s comments as racist.
“Trump telling White House visitors to the president’s private dining room that Obama “just sat in here and watched basketball all day” is yet another racist lie from the man who spent 5 1/2 years lying about President Obama’s birth certificate,” CNN commentator Keith Boykin wrote on Twitter.
