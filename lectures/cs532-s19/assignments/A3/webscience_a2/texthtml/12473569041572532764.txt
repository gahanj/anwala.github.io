The Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Khamenei unloaded on America’s top leaders this week; telling a packed crowd that his country’s infamous “Death to America” chant includes the deaths of President Trump, Secretary of State Pompeo, and John Bolton.
“‘Death to America’ means death to Trump and John Bolton and Pompeo,” said Khamenei. “It means death to American leaders, who happen to be these people at this time.”
The Ayatollah’s comments come as Tehran celebrates the 40th anniversary of their religious revolution; overthrowing western-backed leadership and installing an Islamic regime.
The relationship between the US and Iran reached a new low this year after the United States announced its decision to withdraw from the International Nuclear Agreement; reinstating harsh economic penalties on Iranian leadership and businesses.
