McCabe alleges in the book that Trump and White House Counsel Don McGahn offered him protection in exchange for loyalty.
“The president and his men were trying to work me the way a criminal brigade would operate,” he wrote.
McCabe became acting FBI director after Trump fired James Comey
Rosenstein and the White House both publicly deny that Rosenstein was directed to write the memo, but, according to McCabe, Rosenstein privately said that Trump ordered him to write it.
“He said it wasn’t his idea. The president had ordered him to write the memo justifying the firing,” McCabe wrote.
