Rob Lowe has been criticised by fans after tweeting about the LAX protest.
The Parks & Recreation actor, 52, shared a message with his fans with his first-hand experience of what was going at the airport in Los Angeles.
Thousands of people have descended there to protest against new US President Donald Trump’s 90-day ban on citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from coming into the States.
Just landed. Saw grandmas and little children dragging heavy luggage for for BLOCKS just trying to get home. #laxprotest
But instead of talking about all the travellers who have been detained at the airport, Lowe instead chose to focus on something else.
He tweeted: ‘Just landed. Saw grandmas and little children dragging heavy luggage for for BLOCKS just trying to get home. #laxprotest’
Admittedly, not a nice situation for the elderly or kids but probably not as annoying as being held indefinitely and not knowing if and when you’ll be allowed to return home to see your family.
Have YOU been to a refugee camp? Talked to the families, or just know the talking points? Me, on the Syrian border. pic.twitter.com/T1884k1IEx
As his followers soon started to point out.
@RobLowe Are you complaining about #LAXprotest ??? Think about how far so many innocent Syrian families had to walk to save their lives.
@RobLowe I saw grandmas and little children being illegally detained just trying to get to a safe place.
@RobLowe wow it's almost like refugees leave all their belongings behind to try & avoid being murdered at home! but god forbid some luggage.
Hey @RobLowe i wonder if any other travelers have been inconvenienced by being STUCK IN A HOLDING CELL FOR 20 HOURS https://t.co/b99sTcNP5d
Lowe responded by pointing out his stellar humanitarian credentials.

But what everyone wanted to know was this.
