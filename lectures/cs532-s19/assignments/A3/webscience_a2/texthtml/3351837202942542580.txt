Trump BUSTS Obama’s Muslim SPY RING Linked To Navy SEAL’s Death

A shocking Muslim spy ring, employed as intelligence officers handling top secret military information, has been uncovered. What’s worse, the spy ring involves three Muslim brothers hired by Barack Obama, and you’ll be pissed off how these traitors are also linked to the recent death of Navy SEAL William Ryan Owen. Donald Trump is busting these scumbags, and we’re exposing everything the liberal media rats don’t want you to know.
The three alleged Muslim spies, Abid Awan, Imran Awan, and Jamal Awan, were hired as intelligence officers by Barack Obama’s administration and given top security clearance with access to our government’s most sensitive and highly top secret information. According to  Daily Caller , “Three brothers who managed office information technology for members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and other lawmakers were abruptly relieved of their duties on suspicion that they accessed congressional computer networks without permission.”
The brothers were assigned access to three members of the intelligence panel and five members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs along with dozens of congressmen who employed the suspects on a shared basis. This gave them direct access to our military secrets, like missions carried out by Navy SEAL Team Six.
They retained their jobs after Obama left, which is not unheard of since their positions were not seen as political appointments. However, they were fired by Trump’s administration within hours after Navy SEAL William Ryan Owen was killed in Yemen during the top secret raid on al-Qaeda operatives.
The operation was plagued with problems as  one military official remarked , “They [al-Qeada] were heavily armed and knew we were coming.” ABC News  also reports one source close to the raid said, “The SEALs got to the compound where they were instantly met with heavy fire, and it was obvious that al-Qaeda compound fighters had been expecting the Americans.”
With these three Muslim brothers having access to the secret documents about the operation and with government officials stating that al-Qaeda knew the SEAL’s were coming, well, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to connect the dots. The firing of the Awan brothers is linked to the Yemen raid where al-Qaeda knew we were coming, and it tragically ended with Navy SEAL Owens being killed in action.
The House Oversight Committee (pictured) is part of the deepest oversight network with responsibility for the most sensitive and secretive government intelligence, including covert anti-terrorism activity. The Awan brothers had access to everything this committee worked on, including the Yemen operation.
Capt. Joseph R. John, USN (Ret), the Chairman of Combat Veterans for Congress PAC, has written warnings about Obama appointing Muslim Brotherhood spies throughout our government, and at this point, most of them are still in their positions.  Captain John wrote , “Members of the Muslim Brotherhood, CAIR, and MPAC have sinister goals that are not in support of the US Constitution or The Bill of Rights. They have become a very dangerous ‘Fifth Column’ in the United States, appointed by Obama to very high and sensitive positions in the US Government agencies.”
He went on to write , “For nearly 8 years Obama has been filling the Washington bureaucracy including DHS, the CIA, DOD, the National Security Council, the White House, the State Department, every US Intelligence Agency, and the US Armed Forces with thousands of members of the CAIR, MPAC, the Muslim Brotherhood, and other Muslim Brotherhood front groups.”
With Obama having eight years to appoint Muslim operatives into high ranking positions, many with top security clearances, it’s going to take some time to get rid of all the rats. As one Trump political advisor told Politico , “trying to nail down who the leakers are is like trying to count the cockroaches under the couch.”
The liberal mainstream media nutjobs are taking delight, ignoring this very serious situation and reporting Trump created leaks. They refuse to see the big picture, and that is leakers are traitors and it goes beyond leaks. Giving our enemies information is treason, but the mainstream media is refusing to do their job and investigate the Awan brothers.
We the people, as patriotic Americans, can no longer stand by and allow the mainstream media to disregard the truth and refuse to report it. So, once again in the history of this great nation, it is up to us to spread the truth far and wide. There are radical Muslims who work against America in the United States, and we will expose them and root them out where ever we find them.
