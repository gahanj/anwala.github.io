For the thirteenth weekend in a row, demonstrators of the “yellow vests” (gilets jaunes) took to the streets in various French cities to protest against the social policy of the government. In Paris the event was noisy and a demonstrator was wounded. His hand was torn off, presumably after he was hit by a flash grenade from the police

This weekend again, tens of thousands of demonstrators were present in a number of French cities. In the capital Paris, hundreds of demonstrators had gathered on the Champs-Elysées on Saturday afternoon.
The protest did not happen without incident. The police had to intervene and the hand of a demonstrator was torn off. A French television channel showed images of the injured man, who was taken away by the fire brigade.
