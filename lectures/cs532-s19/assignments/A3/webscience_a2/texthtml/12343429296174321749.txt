We cover multiple arrays of topics for one simple reason. The world is interconnected, and it is not only financial factors that drive the markets. Geopolitics is another major driving force behind the markets. Crowd Psychology dictates that if you focus on the tree, you will forget that the tree is part of a forest and in doing so you will miss the bigger picture. For example, George Soros is behind the surge in fake stories, the massive Anti-Trump riots and the funding of plethora of revolutions that seek to change the existing regime.  Having the ability to cross analyse multiple factors with an open mind provides you with a much clearer picture of what to expect from the financial markets.
