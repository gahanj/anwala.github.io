In the latest installment of Donald Trump Jr being bad at Twitter, the president's son has attempted to support the border wall with a statistic on murders.
In his profound wisdom, Trump Jr cited the murder rates in the Mexican city of Ciudad Juárez in 2017, where more than 700 people lost their lives at the hands of others.
Juárez borders the city of El Paso in Texas, which in the same year only experienced 19 deaths, according to Trump Jr.
 
The rheotoric that Trump Jr is trying to convey here is simple. As there is a border wall in El Paso, it keeps out Mexican migrants, who he has deemed to be murderers.
Therefore, if there was a wall across the entire US/Mexico border then the murder rate in the entire US would fall dramatically, right? Well, no.
