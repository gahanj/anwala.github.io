In an interview airing Sunday on AM 970 "The Answer," Cornyn told John Catsimatidis that a compromise bill could still be possible while accusing Speaker Nancy Pelosi

"Unfortunately this reflects some of the worst of Washington, because this really hasn’t been about border security. This hasn’t even really been about the money. It’s been about Ms. Pelosi wanting to make a political point, and denying the president something that he would consider to be a win," he says.
Cornyn stressed that "cooler heads" would see Congress through to a compromise on the issues of funding for President Trump
"But I think cooler heads are prevailing," Cornyn says. "We have a conference committee … that’s going to work something out."
"The only question is — is this going to be something that both Ms. Pelosi and the president can essentially agree to where both get a win?" he says. "But we don’t need to shut the government down again.”
Congress has until Feb. 15 to reach a deal to fund the federal government that passes the White House's muster for border security measures. It's unclear whether Trump will stick to his previous demand for more than $5 billion for wall funding in any bill to keep the government funded.
Trump plans to address the issue of border security Monday at a rally in El Paso, Texas, as lawmakers meet for a final week of negotiations before the Friday deadline.
