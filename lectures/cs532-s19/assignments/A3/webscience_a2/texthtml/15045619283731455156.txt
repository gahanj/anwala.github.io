The court of the Danish city of Herning sentenced a woman with psychological problems to four years in prison for ill-treatment of her child because she had been draining half a liter of blood from her son every week for five years.
The court was of the opinion that with her actions she put the life of her son in danger and followed the arguments of the prosecutor. The mother, a nurse by profession, decided not to challenge the conviction. “I saw in her eyes that it had to stop, she could not take it anymore,” said her lawyer René Knudsen.
The 36-year-old woman began to take blood from her son when the child was only eleven months old.
“It was not a decision I made aware, I do not know why I started doing it. It has gradually happened. I flushed the blood into the toilet and threw the injection needles into the trash can, “she said in court. That lasted five years until she was arrested with a bag of blood in her hand in September 2017. She is no longer allowed to work as a nurse.
On social networks she cultivated the image of a single mother who was fighting for her sick son.
The child is now seven years old and lives with his father. Shortly after birth the child had a bowel disorder, but doctors did not understand why he had so little blood. He received a blood transfusion 110 times.
