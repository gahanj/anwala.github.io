Just days after President Trump said his administration was prepared to “build a Human Wall if necessary” to protect the nation from illegal immigration, a group of his supporters in New Mexico joined hands along the U.S.-Mexico border in support of the construction of a border wall .
Waving American flags and holding handmade signs, advocates for tougher border security formed a human shield along the partially fenced border at Sunland Park, N.M., just across the line from Ciudad Juarez in Mexico's Chihuahua state.

Trump cited “Tremendous numbers” of people entering the U.S. through Mexico as the reason for his "human wall" pledge in a Tuesday tweet.
Last Sunday, the Pentagon announced nearly 4,000 additional active duty troops will be deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border. Congress has wrangled over Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to construct a border wall. The impasse led to a 35-day partial government shutdown.
Congress is reportedly nearing a deal  that would include far less money for the wall -- about $1.6 billion. But whether Trump would accept the plan, which would also avoid another government shutdown, is unknown.
