Some readers wonder  how we come up with our job approval ratings for the president  since they often don’t show as dramatic a change as some other pollsters do. It depends on how you ask the question and whom you ask.
To get a sense of longer-term job approval trends for the president, Rasmussen Reports compiles our tracking data on a full  month-by-month basis.
Rasmussen Reports has been a pioneer in the use of automated telephone polling techniques, but many other firms still utilize their own operator-assisted technology ( see methodology ).
Daily tracking results are collected via telephone surveys of 500 likely voters per night and reported on a three-day rolling average basis. To reach those who have abandoned traditional landline telephones, Rasmussen Reports uses an online survey tool to interview randomly selected participants from a demographically diverse panel. The margin of sampling error for the full sample of 1,500 Likely Voters is +/- 2.5 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence. Results are also compiled on a full-week basis and crosstabs for  full-week results  are available for  Platinum Members .
Rasmussen Reports is a media company specializing in the collection,             publication and distribution of public opinion information.
We conduct public opinion polls on a variety of topics to inform our audience on events             in the news and other topics of interest. To ensure editorial control and independence,             we pay for the polls ourselves and generate revenue through the sale of subscriptions,             sponsorships, and advertising. Nightly polling on politics, business and lifestyle topics             provides the content to update the Rasmussen Reports web site many times each day.             If it's in the news, it's in our polls. Additionally, the data drives a daily update newsletter and various media outlets             across the country.
