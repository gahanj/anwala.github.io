Some suggested that the giant Trump depicted as “God Emperor Trump” refers to a famous miniature game called Warhammer 40k.
It came as part of the annual Carnival of Viareggio in Italy, where parade of floats and masks made of paper-pulp walk around the city depicting popular people, mostly political.
While the giant statue has impressed Trump’s supporters, it highlights Italy’s recent admiration and support of Trump’s administration.
