Washington, D.C. – Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued this statement on the situation in Venezuela:
“I support the decision of the National Assembly, Venezuela’s sole remaining democratic institution, to recognize Juan Guaidó, President of the National Assembly, as the Interim President until full, fair and free elections can be held.  The United States must respect legitimate democratic processes, and support the right of the people of Venezuela to protest and defend their human rights.
“Nicolas Maduro’s regime of repression and impoverishment for his personal enrichment continues to gravely violate human rights, and must be condemned swiftly by the full international community.  His recent decision to block bridges and cut off channels of food and supplies imperils the health and futures of the Venezuelan people, and must be immediately reversed.
“During this perilous time, the United States must support the people of Venezuela.”
