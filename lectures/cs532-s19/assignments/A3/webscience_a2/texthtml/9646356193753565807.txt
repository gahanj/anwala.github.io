Gallup: The Obamas are America's most admired man and woman, beat out Trump for top spot
Michelle Obama has taken Hillary Clinton's place as the most admired woman in the U.S., taking the spot next to her husband, former President Barack Obama, who has remained the most admired man for the last 11 straight years, according to Gallup's annual poll.
President Trump came in second place for the second year in a row but we must note that it's the 13th time (two for Trump) that a sitting president didn't top the list since 1946.
It looks like Obama is just more popular than Trump, even in retirement.
Here were how the votes were tallied :
Most admired man:
Barack Obama (19%)
Donald Trump (13%)
