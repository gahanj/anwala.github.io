President Trump said the United States will never become a socialist country in his 2019 State of the Union address.
"We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom â and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair," Trump said Tuesday night.
"Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country," the president said. "America was founded on liberty and independence - not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free."
