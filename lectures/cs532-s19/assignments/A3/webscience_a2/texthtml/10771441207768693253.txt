The statement was released shortly before the Massachusetts Democrat made her formal announcement about a 2020 bid for the White House.
President Donald Trump's 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale issued a statement Saturday about Warren's campaign, saying "The American people will reject her dishonest campaign and socialist ideas like the green New Deal, that will raise taxes, kill jobs and crush America's middle-class."
The Green New Deal, a set of progressive priorities regarding climate change championed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., calls for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and for those who want a job to be given one, among other policy positions . It has been widely panned by conservatives as unfeasible and expensive .
Parscale pointed to Warren's statements about having Native American heritage.
“Elizabeth Warren has already been exposed as a fraud by the Native Americans she impersonated and disrespected to advance her professional career, and the people of Massachusetts she deceived to get elected.”
