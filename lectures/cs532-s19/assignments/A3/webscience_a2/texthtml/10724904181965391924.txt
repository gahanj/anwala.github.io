Potential 2020 Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke is set to speak at a march against President Trump's border wall in his hometown of El Paso, Texas on Monday across the street from Trump's first "Make America Great Again" rally of 2019,  reports CBS .
Driving the news: Trump called El Paso one of the nation's "most dangerous cities" in his State of the Union address last week, erroneously claiming that a section of border wall built in 2008 lowered the city's crime rates. O'Rourke also authored a Medium post about Trump's visit, writing that El Paso is "safe not because of walls, and not in spite of the fact that we are a city of immigrants. Safe because we are a city of immigrants and because we treat each other with dignity and respect."
