President Donald Trump repeatedly stated during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would release his taxes, which he has not done. 
Since Democrats won a majority of the House in November, they have the right to issue a subpoena for Trump's taxes. 
Trump should have no problem with this as he has stated that an audit is the only reason for him not releasing his taxes. Problem solved.
