Today the President announced that he agreed to reopen the government for a small three week period to get federal employees and the United States Coast Guard paid.
Never Trump however was in full effect of this announcement, and the likes of Ann Coulter and Mike Cernovich couldn’t wait to attack the President on his decision.
The President has done more in his first two years than the President’s of the past 40 years. He’s an amazing President, and should be treated as such. Unemployment, GDP, military funding, 600,000+ manufacturing jobs, North Korean talks, just to name a few.
I for one still stand with my President, and a three week negotiating period from the master of the “Art of the Deal” isn’t going to detour me from my support of this amazing man.
The Tweet Storm of Huey and Duey can be seen below. Never have I seen such weak minded folks that give up on things in my life. Don’t be like this.
Good news for George Herbert Walker Bush: As of today, he is no longer the biggest wimp ever to serve as President of the United States.
Commander-in-Soy!
Sure feel safer today, with the feds taking Roger Stone off the streets.  No need for a border wall now.  Nothing to fear from MS-13. #OurTaxDollarsAtWork
Trump is a broken man. It's over for him.
Trump tweets about Roger Stone raid, "Who alerted CNN to be there?"  Just think!  If you were president, you could haul the FBI director's ass into the Oval Office and ask him yourself.
I'm vicariously embarrassed for Hannity and others, who have to spin this pathetic and weak display.
How many people were hired from Great Again dot gov?
Nancy Pelosi is alpha.
Old enough to remember when "experts" were saying Nancy Pelosi didn't deserve to take back he position at Speaker of the House.
We are now taking calls to talk about the Commander-in-Soy's blabbering "speech" today. https://t.co/gxpWo8htjA
80% of you are MAGA, and I respect your point of view.
But….An honest question.
Aren't you tired of having to make excuses for Trump?
NO WALL NO WALL NO WALL NO WALL NO WALL NO WALL

Trump is live, with more excuses? We shall see! https://t.co/StosJPcG93
