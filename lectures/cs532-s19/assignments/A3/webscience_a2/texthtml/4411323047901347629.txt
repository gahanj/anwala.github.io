Everyone is going down!
Everyone within Donald Trump’s inner circle is being indicted thanks to the crooked president — and the next one to go might just be his favorite son, Donald Trump Jr. And apparently, Donnie Jr. knows he’s going down, too.
On the “Overtime” portion of HBO’s Real Time, journalist Natasha Bertrand explained to host Bill Maher that Trump Jr. is probably going to be indicted any day now, and he’s already warning his buddies and saying goodbye.
When Maher asked Bertrand which of Trump’s corrupt family members would be the first to go — Don Jr. or Jared Kushner — Bertrand said there was no doubt in her mind that it would be Trump’s son. She said:
I think the Don Jr. is in more immediate jeopardy. He has been telling his friends and associates that he expects to be indicted, and he’s been saying that for the last couple of months.
His accounts about the Trump Tower meeting in 2016, and his accounts about the Trump Tower in Moscow and how involved he was in that could put him in some legal jeopardy there.”
This is a major admission from Donnie Jr., who has spent quite a bit of time on Twitter defending his father and everyone in Trump’s inner circle. Now it seems as though he’s resigned to the fact that he’s been found out, and is done trying to fight the inevitable. He’s saying his parting words.
We all knew that anyone who worked closely with Trump would be taken down with the president, and now the president is responsible for the indictment of his own son. It’s only a matter of time (hopefully not much longer) before the president himself officially comes under fire for all of his corrupt behavior.
