President Donald Trump was back at it early today, offering a menu of tweets and retweets that perhaps indicated he had his memory jogged by watching the new Lego movie. Today’s general Twitter theme: “Everything is Awesome!”
Of course, in the world of the tweetstorm, that means praise is mixed with jabs at enemies real and perceived. There was no shortage of that, as Adam Schiff, former President Obama, and the Democrats came in for a few broadsides.
