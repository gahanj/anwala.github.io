President Donald Trump is on a roll Saturday night.
First, he mocked Democrats for turning the border wall into a 2020 campaign issue.
Then, he skewered Sen. Elizabeth Warren with an apparent joke referencing the Trail of Tears.
Now, it seems Trump is taking on the Democrats’ Green New Deal — proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez –and just how “great” it would be for the “so-called ‘Carbon footprint’ to eliminate among other things cows and the military.”
“I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal,” Trump wrote.  “It would be great for the so-called ‘Carbon Footprint’ to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military – even if no other country would do the same.  Brilliant!”
