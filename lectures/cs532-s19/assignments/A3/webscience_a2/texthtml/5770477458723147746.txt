Thanks to President TrumpÃ¢â¬â¢s humiliating impulsiveness and appalling disrespect for everyone and everything around him, our relationships with the rest of the world have taken a nosedive for the worse. That much was made painfully clear on Saturday morning in the wake of the tragic van attack on a crowd in Munster, Germany.
GermanyÃ¢â¬â¢s security services announced they were treating the attack as terrorism but refused to share the identity of the suspect with the United States, according to CBS News.
The incident is being treated as terrorism, but the suspectÃ¢â¬â¢s identification has not yet been transferred to the U.S., a U.S. intelligence source told CBS News.
This is likely because the last time this happened Donald Trump immediately went to Twitter and began tweeting out unconfirmed information, exploiting the London Bridge terror attack last September to advance his Islamophobic agenda before British intelligence services had a chance to nail down all the facts Ã¢â¬â an incredibly inappropriate move for  which he was sternly rebuked by Prime Minister Theresa May.
You canÃ¢â¬â¢t really blame the Germans for wanting to not share classified information with the United States any more. Why would they, when the President might just blurt it out in a meeting with the Russian ambassador?
The president of the United States is so untrustworthy and so unrestrained that U.S. officials have even warned their counterparts to restrict classified information from Trump, lest he accidentally put lives in jeopardy like he did with IsraelÃ¢â¬â¢s mole within Daesh (ISIS/ISIL).
We wish the German intelligence services the best of luck in their efforts to get to the bottom of this morningÃ¢â¬â¢s heinous crime Ã¢â¬â and wish that we had a leader responsible enough to be trusted to be kept in the loop.
