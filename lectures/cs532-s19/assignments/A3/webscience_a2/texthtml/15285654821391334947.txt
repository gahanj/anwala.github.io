There has been a fair amount of rhetoric about the job growth and lower unemployment rate seen since President Trump took office. Candidate Trump touted that there would be 25 million jobs created over 10 years if he was elected. In January 2017, I wrote that this was a fairly easy campaign promise when you analyze the data and realize that it will only take 2% annual growth of the workforce to hit this target.
President Trump started with a distinct advantage with a workforce of 145.7 million, 9% larger than when President Obama took office. If the workforce were to only grow by 2%, that would add just over 2.9 million jobs a year or 243,000 per month. Over the course of 10 years, there would be over 29 million jobs added.
Additionally, over President Obama’s last six and five years in office after the economy had recovered from the Great Recession, the average employment gains were 2.42 and 2.48 million jobs per year. Pretty much on track to add 25 million over 10 years. So it appears that Trump can reach his 25 million job growth goal even if the economy continued to grow at the pace under Obama .
To provide a monthly comparison, the average employment gain in Obama’s last six years in office (after getting out of the recession's impact) was 201 thousand. And the average for his last five years was 207 thousand, essentially the same as the 208 thousand for the first nine months this year.
Over 2 million jobs added per year for the past 8 years
Below are the employment gains from President Bush’s last four years in office from just before the start of the Great Recession, through President Obama’s and so far through President Trump’s tenure.
Bush’s last four years in office:
2005: 210,000 per month or 2.52 million for the year
2006: 175,000 per month or 2.09 million
2007: 96,000 per month or 1.15 million
Last six months averaged 55,000 per month
2008: Negative 297,000 per month (recession takes hold)
Lost 3.6 million jobs
Obama’s eight years:
Lost 5.1 million jobs (teeth of the recession)
2010:  88,000 per month or 1.05 million for the year
2011: 174,000 per month or 2.09 million
2012: 179,000 per month or 2.14 million
2013: 192,000 per month or 2.3 million
2014: 250,000 per month or 3 million

Unemployment rate has been dropping for 9 years
The unemployment rate shows pretty much the same progression from President Obama to President Trump . The unemployment rate started to climb the last two years of President Bush’s second term and substantially in Obama’s first year as the Great Recession that he had inherited was having a huge impact.
Bush’s last four years in office:
December 2005: 4.9%
December 2009: 9.9%, increased 2.6%(teeth of the recession)
December 2010: 9.3%, decreased 0.6%
December 2011: 8.5%, decreased 0.8%
December 2012: 7.9%, decreased 0.6%
December 2013: 6.7%, decreased 1.2%
December 2014: 5.6%, decreased 1.1%
December 2015: 5.0%, decreased 0.6%
December 2016: 4.7%, decreased 0.3%
Trump’s through September:
December 2017: 4.1%, decreased 0.6%
September 2018: 3.7%, decreased 0.4%
The second graph that shows the U.S. unemployment rate continues on essentially the same path even with a slightly higher GDP growth rate (based on trailing four quarters growth).
