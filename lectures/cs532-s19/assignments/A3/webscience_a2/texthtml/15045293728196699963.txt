Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu, a former military prosecutor who knows the law inside and out, put some of his legal expertise on display in front of the television cameras on Friday, when he hammered Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker over what the Constitution actually says. Now Lieu is upping the ante by going directly after Donald Trump.
After Matt Whitaker’s embarrassing testimony went completely off the rails, Donald Trump decided to try to change the subject with a Twitter rant about how great North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un is. The whole thing was disgusting, even by Trump’s historically low standards. Ted Lieu wasn’t having any of it.
Ted Lieu fired back at Donald Trump with a complete evisceration of Trump’s tweet, retorting “We should all support diplomacy. But we can’t be naive, gullible or weak. North Korea HAS NOT: Eliminated a single nuclear weapon. Eliminated a single missile. Eliminated any chem weapons. North Korea HAS: Increased nuclear fuel output. Hidden its missile bases.”
Donald Trump also posted an utterly bizarre rant about the election: “It is all a GIANT AND ILLEGAL HOAX, developed long before the election itself, but used as an excuse by the Democrats as to why Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the Election! Someday the Fake News Media will turn honest & report that Donald J. Trump was actually a GREAT Candidate!” Ted Lieu simply replied, “Boring.”
