President Trump signed a new initiative Thursday to help bring economic security to 50 million women around the world by 2025, calling it a “historic step.”
The president said the goal is to empower women “to allow their home countries to become self-reliant” and less dependent on foreign aid.
The White House described the plan, called the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, as “the first-ever whole-of-government approach focused on advancing women’s full and free participation in the global economy.”
Using $50 million in starter funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development, the program will aim to improve women’s access to quality education and skills training, promote funding for women’s entrepreneurship and access to capital, and identify and reduce legal and regulatory barriers to women’s participation in the global economy.
The president’s eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump , said it’s an “ambitious” goal toward women’s empowerment, adding, “We’re going to get there.”
The plan will partner with private companies, including UPS and Walmart, Ms. Trump said.
