“Them Trumps” were back on “ Saturday Night Live ” spoofing the real Trumps as a black family — worried about the fallout from those taxpayer-financed golf vacations with Puff Daddy.
The sketch poses as a brief episode of the TV series — “by the producers of Empire” — that “ax the question: ’What if Donald Trump was black?’” 
This time the family is headed in their limo to the State of the Union address.
“Dad, you think this … speech is gonna set all those haters straight?” asks Darius Jr. (Chris Redd).
“Of course it is, son,” responds Kenan Thompson ’s Darius Trump decked out in a Donald-like blond wig (and red tie). “Now let’s get on up to the Capitol so I can do what I do.” 
But Daughter L’evanka ( Ego Nwodim ) is worried. “Dad! What about all the allegations” — like the “Trump Perm Academy” lawsuits and the Russian collusion probe.
“What happened between me and Russia  is between me and Russia,” Darius insists.
When wife Malika ( Leslie Jones ) warns him that special counsel Robert Mueller is closing in, Darius responds:  “Why you trying to play me? I know how to deal with Mueller. I keep my white boys on a leash.”
Not according to the “preview” for the next episode … when Darius is pulled over.
