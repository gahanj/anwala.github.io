Randy Rainbow Song Parody, "The Donald Trump Cell Block Tango (Part One)"
YouTube parody singer Randy Rainbow is back with yet another scathing video. In his new song, “The Donald Trump Cell Block Tango,” Randy completely reads President Trump, Robert Mueller and all of Trump’s indicted allies for filth to the tune of “Cell Block Tango” from Chicago.
Just like the original track, Randy opens up his parody by listing names, sounds and other keywords, except they're all related to the Mueller investigation and recent political arrests. After repeating “Trump, six, flip, cuckoo, Huckabee, Mueller” a couple of times, Randy breaks into the song’s chorus: “They had it coming.”
“The greatest witch hunt in history has dropped houses on six of the president’s personal associates,” Randy explains in one of the song’s verses. “Including Roger Stone, who’s been indicted on multiple charges, including lying, obstructing justice, witness tampering and lacking basic fashion sense.”
As the video closes, Randy does a mock interview with Sarah Huckabee Sanders, asking her about the arrests that have been made. After Sanders denies his accusations, Randy hilariously breaks out into the song’s chorus again, only this time Sanders “has it coming.”
