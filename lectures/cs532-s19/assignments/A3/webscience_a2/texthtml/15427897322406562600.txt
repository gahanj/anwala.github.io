Military commanders look aside as Donald Trump passes before his State of the Union address, February 5, 2019
I joined Monocle 24’s The Briefing on Friday to discuss the internal battle between Donald Trump and the US military, including over Trump’s abrupt order for withdrawal of American troops from Syria.
We discuss how the Pentagon, infuriated by Trump pushing out Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, is spinning out the timetable for any departure — and the wider conflict as a military does not trust its Commander-in-Chief.
