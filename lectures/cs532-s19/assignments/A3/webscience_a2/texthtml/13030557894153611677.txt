Donald Trump's Wall Could Be Shut Down By Some Butterflies

Donald Trump is ploughing on with the border wall cash negotiation policy of holding his breath until he passes out, but there's a new roadblock in his way that few factored into the battle to get the wall built: thousands of rare butterflies.
As USA Today reports , the National Butterfly Centre in Mission, Texas, is kicking off because it would be cut off from about 70 percent of its 100-acre property if Trump's wall were built along its currently proposed route, following the banks of a levee.
The presence of government agency trucks and a massive earth-mover preparing to tear up what the Butterfly Centre describes as "a remnant of native habitat in the Lower Rio Grande Valley Wildlife Conservation Corridor" hasn't helped either.
That's why it's about to file an emergency restraining order to try to stop the wall being built, arguing that the ground which would be turned into the much-vaunted big, beautiful wall was reserved to protect that native habitat as well as endangered species including the ocelot - not to mention the graves of Native American people. A 36-foot steel wall with bollards on top doesn't scream 'mellow wildlife sanctuary vibes' or 'peaceful final resting place of historically oppressed people'.
This section of the wall is scheduled for construction in mid-February, but the restraining order and other lawsuits against the wall are still working their way through the judicial system.
