Poll: Every Possible Democratic Candidate Beats Trump in 2020
A new poll by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic polling firm out of North Carolina, found that every potential Democratic candidate in the 2020 presidential election—announced and unannounced—would beat President Trump in a head-to-head contest. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who has not announced a presidential bid, came in the lead out of the Democratic hopefuls, with 53 percent of poll participants choosing him compared to 41 percent for Trump. Trump trails Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders by 12 points and California Senator Kamala Harris by 7 points. Harris officially announced her 2020 campaign on January 21, raising $1.5 million in online contributions in only 24 hours. Rounding out the pack of potential Democratic candidates was former representative Beto O’Rourke (TX), as well as senators Elizabeth Warren (MA), Cory Booker (NJ), and Kirsten Gillibrand (NY).
