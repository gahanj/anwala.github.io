Ali Carter stormed into the final of the World Grand Prix with a ruthless 6-0 whitewash of Xiao Guodong in Cheltenham.
An unanswered 382 points from Carter had put him 4-0 up at the mid-session interval, and Guodong’s luck was summed up by the fifth frame.
Leading 59-52 and down to the final ball, the 29-year-old potted the black but watched the cue ball roll back into the pocket to level the frame.
The black was re-spotted and a battle for position followed, however, Carter soon finished it off with a long pot.
And he made no mistake in the following frame to wrap the evening up early.
Judd Trump produced a break of 95 in the deciding frame to edge Barry Hawkins 6-5 and secure his place in the final.
The newly-crowned Masters champion had never been ahead against Hawkins, but seized his chance in the decider to claim another impressive win.
Hawkins had won the first two frames of the match, but Trump quickly hit back to level.
Trump will get the chance to add to his trophy collection this season when he faces Carter in today’s showpiece.
