Is this a serious question or do you live in a bubble?
I am 58 years old but cannot remember any president who has ridiculed himself and a become laughing stock everywhere he goes.
The USA is a great country but is being dragged through the sewer by the current POTUS.
The problem is he represents a great country so it reflects on the people of the USA.
Nobody trusts President Trump he cannot be trusted he pulls out of deals former presidents signed. Which means any deal with a serving president is not worth the paper its written on if the next president reneges on it.
He constantly lies stupid unnecessary lies.
“I landed [and] I’m on the ground and I’m waiting with the King’s and the Queen’s guards, wonderful people. I’m waiting. I was about 15 minutes early and I’m waiting with my wife and that’s fine. Hey, it’s the Queen, right? We can wait. But I’m a little early” DJ Trump. He told a rally in Pennsylvania.
The queen waiting for Donald Trump who was 15 mins late.
The whole world saw he was late. Why the stupid lie?
“In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country,” DJ Trump
Does this include
George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, No wonder the UN members laughed.
I could go on but will close by saying I think America IS a great country you've just got a complete and utter pratt in the White House.
