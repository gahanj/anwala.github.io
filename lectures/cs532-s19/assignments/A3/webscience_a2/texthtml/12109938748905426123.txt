We fed 270,000 words spoken by Donald Trump into a computer program that studies language patterns. This system analyzed his word choice and grammar, learning how to simulate Trump's speech. Here is the speech written entirely by artificial intelligence.
When prompting the neural network for written output, the system allows the user to select a “temperature”, which tells the program how creative or daring to be with its word choice. At low temperatures, the neural network always chooses the most-likely next character as it's generating a sequence, while at high temperatures it will choose a character that's farther down the probability list.
