Schiff was responding to a tweet from Trump late Friday in which the president said North Korea could see immense economic benefits under North Korean leader Kim Jong Un if a denuclearization agreement is reached between Washington and Pyongyang.

“North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, will become a great Economic Powerhouse.

North Korea will become a different kind of Rocket - an Economic one!” Trump tweeted  Friday evening.
