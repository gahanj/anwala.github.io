Go to http://www.preparewithandweknow.com to get your 2-week supply of food or upgrade to 4 weeks for over 40% off. That's 92 servings of breakfast, lunch and dinner or 252 servings for 4 weeks. (Try this link also - https://bit.ly/2HOFUb8 )
In statements made during recent interviews, FEMA administrator Brock Long has repeatedly urged all Americans to understand three truths: "FEMA is broke. The system is broken. If this is the new normal, Americans can't rely on a federal cavalry when disaster strikes. They will have to take care of themselves."
There’re two things you can count on when you buy from My Patriot Supply: getting high-quality food for the best value and freedom.
The emergency food you’ll depend on is made from the freshest ingredients. Meals are freeze-dried and sealed airtight with an oxygen absorber enclosed in resealable zipper packs for long-term storage that lasts up to 25 years.
