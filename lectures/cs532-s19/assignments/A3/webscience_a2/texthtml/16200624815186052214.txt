Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is becoming the laughing stock of the world.  Her silly âGreen New Dealâ offered everything from free health care, free money for those âunwillingâ to work and bullet trains to make airplanes obsolete.
President Trump on Saturday mocked AOCâs GND, telling Democrats to âpress forwardâ with it.
âI think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal. It would be great for the so-called âCarbon Footprintâ to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military - even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!â Trump tweeted.
AOCâs GND was such an embarrassment, they deleted it from her government website.
AOCâs advisor Robert Hockett went on Tucker Carlson for damage control and said the protection for those âunwillingâ to work was doctored.
