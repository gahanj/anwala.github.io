Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has reportedly compared President Trump’s behavior to that of a mob boss, saying, “The president and his men were trying to work me the way a criminal brigade would operate,” notes  The Hill .  
McCabe, who had become acting FBI Director after his boss James Comey was fired, makes the allegations in his forthcoming book titled, “The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump.” 
According to  The Guardian , which says it viewed an advanced copy of the book, “McCabe writes that after firing Comey, Trump and the White House counsel, Don McGahn, acted like mobsters by in effect offering McCabe protection in return for loyalty.” 
McCabe himself was eventually fired in March 2018 in a controversial move by the administration just days before he was eligible to retire. 
Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions cited McCabe’s repeated lack of candor as the reason, but the ousted official claimed his firing was “intended to undermine the special counsel’s investigation in which he is a potential witness,” notes the  New York Times . 
Trump took the opportunity to publicly blast him at the time,  tweeting : “Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI – A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!” 
McCabe also alleges in his new book that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had complained about being coerced by Trump into writing a memo justifying Comey’s firing.
