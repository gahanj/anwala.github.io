“Violent jihad gets the headlines, but stealth jihad gets the results,” reflected Middle East Forum President Daniel Pipes at a recent Washington conference about Qatari influence, echoing the growing calls on Capitol Hill for a crackdown on the Al Jazeera media network.
Middle East Forum’s Feb. 6 gathering — dubbed “Qatar: U.S. Ally or Global Menace?” — brought to light how the Qatari government uses the state-funded broadcaster to promote hardline Islamism and hatred of the West.
“The greatest problem with Al Jazeera is how, for a generation, it has mainstreamed and normalized an Islamist grievance narrative, which has served as sort of the mother’s milk for all sorts of Islamist movements,” said Alberto Fernandez, president of the Middle East Broadcasting Network.

Nineteen members of Congress, in March 2018, signed a bipartisan letter  that urged the Department of Justice to enforce the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) with respect to Al Jazeera. The act requires agents representing foreign interests in the United States to disclose their relationship with foreign governments.

The lawmakers stated that Al Jazeera’s content “often directly undermines American interests with favorable coverage of U.S. State Department-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations.” Later last year, reports emerged that the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2019 fiscal year would indeed mandate Al Jazeera to register as a foreign agent under U.S. law.
Yet Fernandez said he believes that “when we look at this problem, we do have to look at ourselves a little bit,” noting how three successive American presidential administrations have failed to make Al Jazeera’s incitement “a bilateral issue between the United States and Qatar.” In particular, he said the State Department’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs has not prioritized the Al Jazeera issue among the list of approximately 10 Qatar-related matters that are on its plate.

Mohamed Fahmy — a former Al Jazeera bureau chief in Cairo who is suing the network for alleged negligence and breach of contract after he spent over 400 days imprisoned in Egypt on charges of belonging to a terrorist organization — recounted his discovery of Al Jazeera’s radicalization and deployment of non-journalist Egyptian youths in the news-gathering process.

Fahmy recalled being approached by scores of students and Muslim Brotherhood sympathizers, who would be paid $200-$300 for footage they gathered for Al Jazeera. It was all “happening behind my back” as an Al Jazeera English bureau chief, he said, and the youths’ confessions would land him in prison.
“Often, we judge Al Jazeera by what you see on the screen, but a lot of it that angers security officials…is what happens in the news-gathering process,” Fahmy said. “This is not about press freedom. It’s about a network that resulted in the death of young people…whose minds were poisoned by the ideas that this network put in their head.”
Fahmy, who alleges that Al Jazeera employed him under false pretense by failing to inform him of the youths’ ties to terrorist groups, declared to the network that “I’m after you with my pen, with my camera, and in court.”
Samantha Mandeles, coordinator of Middle East Forum’s Islamist Watch project, noted that Al Jazeera has “savaged” President Donald Trump and his administration in more than 1,800 news and opinion pieces since the 2016 election, insisting that Trump is either Jewish or controlled by Jewish forces. Al Jazeera’s online channel AJ+, meanwhile, aims to give itself a veneer of liberalism by calling itself a “voice of the voiceless.”
Similarly, Fernandez explained that Al Jazeera “sets the mood music” for the “revolutionary” and violent appeal of Islamic terrorist organizations. He said that although Qatar itself is an authoritarian regime, the tone in Al Jazeera’s coverage caters to a populist sentiment through a progressive façade.
HOUSTON – Prosecutors say they will review more than 1,400 criminal cases that involved a Houston police officer who the police chief says lied in an affidavit justifying a drug raid on a home in which two residents were fatally shot by officers.
Authorities also have announced that the FBI is opening an investigation to determine whether any civil rights were violated as a result of the raid and shooting.
Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said Wednesday that the review will look at cases spanning decades that involved Officer Gerald Goines. Twenty-seven of those cases are active.
Goines has been suspended in the wake of the Jan. 28 raid in which a 59-year-old man and a 57-year-old woman were killed. Four officers, including Goines, were shot as they tried to enter the home.

A German man has been deemed unfit to keep his  firearms license after being shot by his dog in the arm, according to reports.
A Munich administrative court on Tuesday dismissed his appeal against an earlier ruling that revoked his license and hunting permit. The man – whose name was not released – was wounded in his arm in 2016 after his dog managed to release the trigger of a rifle left in his car.
The court felt he was unreliable ”because it must be assumed that he will handle firearms and ammunition carelessly in future as well."

Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) used a political action committee (PAC) to funnel campaign funds back to her boyfriend, according to reports.
Republican strategist Luke Thompson first made known on Twitter last week that Ocasio-Cortez’s boyfriend Riley Roberts had a house.gov email address and was designated as one of her “Staff,” therefore “drawing a salary on the taxpayer’s dime.”
While you were having a nice Valentine's Day, @AOC decided to put her boyfriend on staff – drawing a salary on the taxpayer's dime. Nice to see her adapting to the swamp so quickly. pic.twitter.com/bvncwzxY53
The revelation was met with fierce opposition by Ocasio-Cortez and her Chief of Staff Saikat Chakrabarti, who accused Thompson of “doxxing” Roberts despite the information being publicly available, and failed to explain why Roberts would need such access.
Actually this cal designation is a permission so he can have access to my Google Cal. Congressional spouses get Gcal access all the time.
Next time check your facts before you tweet nonsense.
He started doxxing him. That's a violation of terms in Twitter.
“Per the House Admin office, a family member can, in special circumstances, get a house.gov email address,” Thompson reported Wednesday.
“But Roberts is not a family member, and although AOC referred to him as her partner in November of last year, she omitted him from her mandatory candidate financial disclosures for 2017 and 2018. Perhaps they’ve gotten married since. If so — if he is her spouse now — we should see his finances disclosed along with hers in her 2019 disclosure form due in May. But to be clear, AOC did not disclose Roberts’s finances as a spouse during her campaign.”
As Chakrabarti noted, Roberts also isn’t an unpaid volunteer and “isn’t doing any government work.”
He's not paid. We have no volunteers in the office. He's not doing any government work. He can see her calendar just like spouses/partners/family members in other congressional office. Check your damn facts before you report bullshit. Lazy journos need to learn to do their jobs.
Additionally, instead of producing the appropriate evidence to refute Thompson’s claims, the mainstream media attempted to provide cover for Ocasio-Cortez using their own talking points.
“Instead of asking if Roberts had been supplied with the badge and pin appropriate to a Congressional spouse, evidence of which her office should have been able to produce easily, AOC’s worshipful stenographers in the press went into overdrive witlessly repeating her talking-points,” Thompson wrote.
Former chairman of the House Oversight Committee Jason Chaffetz said Friday that such an arrangement was “inappropriate.”
“It’s totally naïve and inappropriate – you wouldn’t allow it in most companies, let alone the House of Representatives. There should be real consequences,” he told Fox News.
“When I was in the House, my scheduler would forward my wife my schedule once a week. But you’re not allowed unfettered access. And he isn’t even her spouse…It should be referred to the ethics committee for further investigation,” he added.
It gets deeper: Chakrabarti co-founded a PAC called Brand New Congress LLC in 2017, which Ocasio-Cortez paid for “strategic consulting” for her campaign.
Brand New Congress LLC then hired Roberts as a “marketing consultant” for AOC’s campaign, paying him approximately $6,000.
A rich guy used a PAC to pay @AOC 's boyfriend $6,000 when her campaign was running out of money. After AOC won, she gave that rich guy a job in her office. Follow me on a journey. https://t.co/KSQqq3xKRY
“Why would Chakrabarti, a founding engineer at Stripe and a wealthy veteran of Silicon Valley, be hiring a no-name ‘UX Experience’ guy with little discernible marketing experience to serve as Brand New Congress PAC’s sole marketing consultant?” Thompson asked.
“The answer seems to be that Chakrabarti was funneling money paid to him by AOC’s campaign back to Roberts and by extension to AOC,” Thompson wrote.
In effect, Chakrabarti likely reimbursed AOC through Brand New Congress LLC to mitigate her campaign’s mounting debt, he says.
“Regardless of whether or not Roberts was officially AOC’s spouse at that time, it seems probable Chakrabarti was reimbursing her for her campaign expenses off-books. Brand New Congress PAC simply served as a pass-through to do so,” Thompson continued.
After Ocasio-Cortez won in the 2018 midterms, she then hired Chakrabarti as her Chief of Staff.
“That’s definitely unethical and potentially illegal,” Thompson wrote. “Chakrabarti may have made an illegal campaign contribution in excess of federal limits. Regardless, it raises questions about Chakrabarti’s hiring as AOC’s Chief of Staff after her election.”
A shocking aspect of this is that the mainstream media failed to uncover (or simply ignored) any of this information despite the fact it was publicly available for scrutiny.
For now, it appears AOC is adjusting to the swamp just fine.
