President Donald Trump delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress.
It will mark the third occasion during Trump's presidency that he will speak in Congress, and it is expected to be a colder reception, following the 2018 midterm election losses that handed Democrats control of the House and a lengthy stand off with Democrats that forced a government shutdown.
Stacey Abrams will offer a rebuttal on behalf of the Democratic party following Trump's speech.
