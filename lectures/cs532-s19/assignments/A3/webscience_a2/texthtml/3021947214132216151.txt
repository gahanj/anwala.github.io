Tyler Linfesty aka Plaid Shirt Guy became an inspiration to all after watching him react honestly to Trump's speech, unlike the rest of the rent-a-crowd. This compilation is a tribute to many more people that couldn't help but react to Trump's absurdity.
The Austrian clip (lady at the end) is only satire - the translation is not real. It's originally from Colbert. :-)
