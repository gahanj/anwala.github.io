In the tweet posted hours after Warren’s presidential campaign announcement earlier in the day, Trump joked that he would “see [Warren] on the campaign TRAIL.”
“Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!” he wrote.

Trump has frequently mocked Warren for her claims of Native American ancestry, dubbing the Massachusetts senator “Pocahontas” and making jokes aimed at past statements she has made referencing unspecified Native American ancestry.

Warren announced her candidacy for the Democratic nomination Saturday at a rally in her home state, taking aim at both Trump and a “rigged system” she said of which the billionaire GOP president was a “symptom.”
“Hard-working people are up against a small group that holds far too much power, not just in our economy, but also in our democracy. Like the women of Lawrence, we are here to say enough is enough!” Warren said. Trump is a “symptom of what’s gone wrong in America,” she added, calling out a “rigged system that props up the rich and the powerful and kicks dirt on everyone else.”
She joins a crowded field of presidential candidates that include her fellow Sens. Kamala Harris
