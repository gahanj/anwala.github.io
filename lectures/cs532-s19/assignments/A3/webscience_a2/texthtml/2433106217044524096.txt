M.A.M.O.N. (Monitor Against Mexicans Over Nationwide) is a satirical fantasy sci-fi shortfilm that explores with black humor and lots of VFX the outrageous consequences of Donald Trump´s plan of banning immigration and building an enormous wall on the Mexico - US border.
The dark comedy showcases a spectacular fight involving bizarre weapons, and numerous dark jokes about the cliches and stereotypical antics of the Mexican and Latino community, as the quinceañera, the quetzalcoatl, the lucha libre, the mariachi, the chapulín colorado, etc.
M.A.M.O.N. is part of the  Wecanfxit project, powered by Uruguayan production house Aparato.
Our mission is to change the world using our geeky weapons: cinematography, visual effects and CGI.
Our motto: Making the world a better place, one pixel at a time.
