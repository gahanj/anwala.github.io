Washington Examiner – “MAGA list: 205 ‘historic results’ help Trump make case for 2020 re-election.”  True!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 1, 2019
Trump promoted the site’s “MAGA list” of 205 “historic results” that could help him win re-election in 2020, published Monday.However, the content of the list that Trump bragged about was actually pieced together by his own White House aides. As evidenced in the third paragraph:And before the extensive list itself:Twitter users noticed, and called Trump out over his claim:Great moments in media: Trump’s team gives the Washington Examiner an “exclusive” list of 205 supposed “historic” accomplishments he will campaign on; the Examiner just publishes it in full; Trump tweets about it as if it came from the Examiner. pic.twitter.com/4xa1t9Gt6l— Daniel Dale (@ddale8) January 1, 2019
The Washington Examiner (laughable enough) was given a list to print, by you. That’s not reporting, that’s propaganda.— cj (@markergirl1) January 2, 2019
You gave them the story. It literally came from you. They had nothing to do with it.— Mike Gesler (@MikeGesler) January 2, 2019
From what I understand you/your “team” gave them the list and they published it-lol! This puts a whole new slant on your boast!— Terry Hamilton (@thamilton714) January 2, 2019
