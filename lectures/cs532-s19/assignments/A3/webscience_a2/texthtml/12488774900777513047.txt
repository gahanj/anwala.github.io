moscow time =06.48am 4th may 2016
that would mean the first data was collected from server before it overwrote the logs (24 hour cycle) on the 4th @ 22.48 (moscow time= + 8hrs)
which would mean they were collecting the DATA a full 24 hours before the DNC contacted CROWDSTRIKE
so how did the union of concerned nerds know the RUSSIANS were hacking the DNC before crowdstrike had run the falcon software..A FULL 24 HOURS BEFORE...and they managed to find a single ping aimed at one of many trump servers.. a single ping...
the word's "late at night", and take night as sunset,
on the 5th may 2016 SUNSET was 20.30pm ..
06:48:06 0-4 may 2016

Democrats want to subvert a lawful election by the people and the media helps spread the #DNC lies. thehill.com/homenews/house…
One of the top #DNC operatives casting smears for ratings is @maddow She knowingly and dishonestly claims that republican sentiment that #Democrats want to remove @potus from office is preposterous. newyorker.com/magazine/2018/…
On cue with every move President Trump makes, the #Democrats and #DNC media are ready and waiting to spin and manufacture hysteria in order to fill the airwaves and internet with any fiction that will help their socialist leaders regain power. . @POTUS washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns…
Does AUSA Moira Kim Penza, prosecutor in the fed. #NXIVM #RICO criminal racketeering case, realize that her indictments of #NXIVM leader, Keith Raniere aka "Vanguard," last March, may have affected the outcome of the 2018 Mexican Presidential Election? #ArizonaMafia #Democrats
Moira Kim Penza is 1 of the main prosecutors in the federal #NXIVM #RICO criminal case. A #RICO case is very serious; it is 1 of the most complex types of prosecutions the U.S. Government can initiate. Moira's boss is Richard P. Donoghue, U.S. Atty for the Eastern District of NY.
Penza is a smart lawyer. According to publicly available information, she studied at Cornell Law School, a private Ivy League University located in Ithaca, New York. Cornell was ranked the #13 law school in America, out of 203 law schools, by U.S. News & World Report, in 2018.

The Wilson Center offers an 'Alfa Fellowship Program'. Yes, that Alfa, where we also see Mikhail Fridman and Richard Burt.

Trump and Alfa Bank.
"It dawned on the researchers that this wasn’t an attack, but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the Trump Organization and two servers registered to an entity called Alfa Bank."
