“He does it because he loves our country and he wants it to be successful,” Carson noted, adding that some can’t acknowledge his success because it minimizes some of their arguments, especially the Democrats.
“It detracts from their argument that capitalism is horrible. That we are a horrible country. That we treat minorities the wrong way, we are racist,” he said.  “I guess that’s why there are caravans of minorities trying to get in here.”
Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a contender for president in 2020, recently lambasted Trump and claimed that he is a racist. However, Carson said he hasn’t “seen any evidence of it whatsoever.”
“[Trump’s] philosophy of course is that a rising tide floats all boats,” he said. “And if you create an environment through the corporate tax cuts, deregulation and some of the other policies that he’s put in place, it has a positive effect."
