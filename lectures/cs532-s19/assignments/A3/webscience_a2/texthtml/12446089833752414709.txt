Donald Trump is set to visit London in December for the next NATO Heads of State summit. The exact date and location have not yet been announced, but we must begin building the mobilisation now so the movement is ready to take action in December. Let’s unite against war and military aggression and ensure President Trump's visit to Britain will be met with the response that it deserves.
Trump's visit makes next Saturday's (16 Feb) public meeting even more important. Alongside his visit, the shifting sands of Trump's Middle East policy , the scrapping of the INF treaty and the attempted coup in Venezuela will all be high on the agenda. This is a hugely important meeting at a time when these monumental issues are being masked by the ongoing Brexit wrangling.
Stop the War stalwarts Lindsey German and Tariq Ali will be joined by the excellent campaigning MP for Brighton Kemptown, Lloyd Russell-Moyle, and author and Oxford University Professor, Karma Nabulsi.
The events of 2019 so far have shown how important the anti-war movement in Britain remains and for us to keep up our campaigning work we are asking you to join Stop the War as a member for as little as £2 a month.
We need your support to maintain the strength of the anti-war voice in Britain.
