New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez celebrated President Trump’s vow to ensure America never falls into the clutches of socialism, saying “he’s scared.”
As are the vast majority of sane Americans.
“Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” Trump said to applause from many Republicans in the chamber.
“America was founded on liberty and independence – not government coercion, domination, and control,” the President continued. “We are born free, and we will stay free.”
“Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.”
The Socialist Responds
Ocasio-Cortez viewed the attack, most pointedly aimed at her and another devout socialist in Bernie Sanders, as a badge of honor.
“I think he’s scared,” she told MSNBC . “I thought it was fabulous, it shows that we got under his skin.”

The darling of the far-left resistance party then claimed President Trump was actually concerned about the popularity of her policies.
“I think that he needs to do it because he feels himself losing on the issues,” she claimed. “Every single policy proposal that we have adopted and presented to the American public has been overwhelmingly popular, even some with a majority of Republican voters supporting what we’re talking about.”

While some polls susggest there is support for her platform of taxing the rich at exorbitant rates, the reality becomes a little more clear when voters find out details of the plan – and they don’t approve .
And while it might be gaining popularity in her own radical party, socialism is still nowhere near the approval rate of capitalism.
A Gallup poll in 2018 shows 56 percent of Americans view capitalism positively while just 37 percent feel the same about socialism. These numbers have varied very little over the past decade.
If Trump Is Scared, Pelosi Must Be Too
If President Trump is supposedly scared of Ocasio-Cortez’s and Sen. Sanders’s calls for socialism, then it appears House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is as well.
Here she is applauding when the President said: “America will never be a socialist country.”
“We are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” Pres. Trump says.

Say what you will about Nancy, she is acutely aware of the dangers Ocasio-Cortez’s wild ideas present to her party and the need for independent voters in 2020.
As for Ocasio-Cortez’s claim that Trump is ‘losing on the issues,’ a massive 76 percent of viewers approved of his State of the Union address and the ideas he laid out within it.

That sounds about right. She’s about as stupid, and dangerous, as they come. Former bartender with absolutely no clue as to how to run things. And you thought Hilary was dangerous. This clown is even worse. Time to say bye bye to this socialist idiot.

Pelosi has a good reason to be scared of the socialist splinter group as she for decades has been a staunch defender of insider trading in securities privilege, for the folks on the Hill. The privilege she’s been a major beneficiary of.
The socialist purists like Occasio-Cortez et al could abolish this semi-legal abnormality, should they come to power. Or maybe not, ’cause after all, socialists never miss opportunity to enrich themselves off citizens’ backs. See Venezuela’s Maduro, Zimbabwe’s Mugabe to name a few.
