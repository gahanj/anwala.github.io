An 11-year-old boy called Joshua Trump who was invited by his presidential namesake to his State of the Union speech fell asleep and has been hailed as a hero of the anti-Trump resistance.
Joshua Trump, a middle-school student from Delaware, was invited to the delayed event by Melania Trump . He dropped out of school after being bullied because of his last name.
As cameras panned to the audience, the boy could be seen napping while Donald Trump renewed his promise to build a US-Mexico border and declared illegal immigration “an urgent national crisis”.

Joshua’s parents told WPVI-TV that his classmates had called him an “idiot” and “stupid” for sharing the president’s last name. Although they took him out of school in 2017 to homeschool him, when he returned for middle school the following year the bullying persisted.
His mother, Megan Trump, signed him up for a different school bus to avoid students who were teasing him but on the first trip the driver questioned him about his name.
Joshua was one of the 13 people to receive special invitations to the address by the president and first lady.
