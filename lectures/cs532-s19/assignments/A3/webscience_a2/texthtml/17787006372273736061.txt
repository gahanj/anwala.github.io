President Donald Trump tore into his political opponents at a private lunch  with TV news anchors on Tuesday before the State of the Union address. While Trump called for unity during his speech, he was mocking Democrats just hours before.
Trump was particularly critical of former Vice President Joe Biden, who’s considering running for the Democratic presidential nomination.
“I hope it’s Biden,” Trump said about the 2020 presidential election. “Biden was never very smart. He was a terrible student.”
Trump referred to a plagiarism controversy where Biden admitted he didn’t fully understand how to attribute sources in an academic paper.
“His gaffes are unbelievable,” Trump said. “When I say something that you might think is a gaffe, it’s on purpose; it’s not a gaffe. When Biden says something dumb, it’s because he’s dumb.”
Trump also criticized other senior Democrats, including House Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
“Schumer … can be a nasty son of a bitch,” Trump reportedly told the TV anchors. Trump also referred to Senator Elizabeth Warren again. She is considering a presidential run.
“I hope I haven’t wounded Pocahontas too badly,” Trump reportedly said of Warren, who apologized following a DNA test attempting to prove Native American heritage. Trump has been criticized for referring to Warren by a nickname many Native Americans find offensive.
