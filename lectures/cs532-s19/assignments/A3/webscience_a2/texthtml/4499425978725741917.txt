President Donald Trump used his second State of the Union address on Tuesday to push the familiar themes of his administration – urging a wall along the border with Mexico, pressing for an end to foreign wars and claiming credit for an expanding economy – using familiar arguments. Not all of them were true.
Trump told lawmakers he wanted them to build a border wall, suggested they had already voted to do it, and argued it would cut crime. He said the U.S. economy was growing at a record rate, and claimed progress with foreign adversaries and allies alike. The speech largely built on claims Trump and his administration have been making for months, some true, some exaggerated and some simply false.
Some of his claims were not specific – that the U.S. economy is the "hottest economy anywhere in the world" and that he had achieved "impossible" manufacturing job growth – but others were more specific.
Read on to find out how his biggest claims stack up:
