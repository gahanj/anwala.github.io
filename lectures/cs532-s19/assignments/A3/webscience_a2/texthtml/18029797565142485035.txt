‘This is but a symptom of a greater syndrome that currently plagues our country as a result of not acting on President Trump’s bigotry…’

(Kaylee McGhee, Liberty Headlines) Rep. Al Green , D-Texas, vowed to force the House to vote to impeach President Donald Trump, blaming the recent racist scandals that have plagued members of his own party on Congress’s inability to fight bigotry, “starting at the top.”
Green said Virginia’s Democratic governor, Ralph Northam , and the state’s Democratic attorney general, Mark Herring , have both refused to resign because they’ve been made to believe that kind of behavior is OK.
“We no longer stare bigotry down; bigotry now stares us down,” Green said in a statement, released late Thursday night. “Further, an argument that Gov. Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring should resign will subject us to accusations of political hypocrisy if we refuse to take on a bigoted president.”
Following the revelations that a photo on his medical school yearbook page showed men in blackface and KKK robes, Northam last week faced near universal calls to resign from members of both parties.
After first saying he was one of the men, Northam since denied it an refused to step down.
Herring later came forward to confess that he, too, had worn blackface while in college.
Although no prominent public figures have demanded his resignation, he would be third in line for the governorship and faced the real possibility of a promotion when it was revealed that Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax was facing allegations of forcible rape.
“This is but a symptom of a greater syndrome that currently plagues our country as a result of not acting on President Trump’s bigotry,” Green said, according to The Hill.

Instead of facing the racism within his own party, Green has deflected , trying to turn attention back to Trump. Northam and Herring have been emboldened “to a great extent because the Trump presidency has sent a message that you can be immune to the consequences of bigotry, by daring those with the authority and power to constitutionally remove you from office,” he said.
Green didn’t say when he plans on introducing articles of impeachment against Trump, but he forced floor votes twice now, against the wishes of Democratic leadership. His articles of impeachment accused Trump of stirring racial controversy and inciting racial divisions across the country, despite a lack of evidence.
Ironically, given Green’s gripes about holding the current president accountable, it was Bill Clinton who, despite clear evidence of perjury and obstruction of justice, successfully dodged removal from office by a largely party-line vote in the Senate following his December 1998 impeachment.
Trump has not yet been linked evidentially to any conduct that would meet the bar of “high crimes and misdemeanors” established by the Constitution for impeachment, although some Democrats have projected devastating revelations from the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller stemming from an investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other Democratic leaders have sought for now to put an end to impeachment efforts from the radical leftists in their party, arguing that such an effort must have bipartisan support.
“The remedy must be more than talking points about a much-need conversation concerning bigotry,” Green said. “We cannot allow bigotry to go unchecked.”
