Marty Davis thinks President Donald Trump has “done more that’s right for trade in America than any president since World War II.” Davis, a Minnesotan and member of one of the country’s richest families, once worked on his family’s massive dairy farm. Now, he runs Cambria, a producer of quartz used in countertops and other surfaces. His battle against Chinese competitors who dumped hundreds of millions of dollars worth of government-subsidized quartz slabs into the U.S. market from 2010-2018 made him a true believer in Trump’s tariffs on some imports. Davis said the Chinese offered finished quartz at prices below the cost of his raw material.
 
Q: You said you were willing to compete with any company, but you couldn’t compete with a government. What did you mean?
 
Q: You got the U.S. government to place anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese quartz. What set you off?
 
Q: Many other international business people consider the president’s tariffs and trade policies an attack on globalization. Why aren’t you upset by what the president is doing?
 
Q: What do you think of a bill in Congress to limit Trump’s power to use national security as a reason to impose tariffs?
 
Q: You talk about CEOs and Wall Street, but American consumers like the cheap fruit, too. How do you ask people to make a sacrifice?
A: Trump needs to do a much better job of explaining it in a grassroots manner. But the reality is: How comfortable are you as a consumer getting subsidized by the Chinese government. Do you think that you are really the beneficiary? Or are you being set up to be the hostage?
