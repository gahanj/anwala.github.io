(1 Feb 2019) President Donald Trump doubled down on the need for a wall or possibly declaring a national emergency during a human trafficking event of the White House Friday.
Trump convened a roundtable to highlight the plight of human trafficking, that included Homeland Security Secretary Kirsten Nielsen and many others.
The president told reporters during the meeting that Democrats are doing a "tremendous disservice" by refusing to give him money for the wall, which he argues is exacerbating the trafficking issue.
"Human trafficking can go down by a tremendous percentage if we had a wall of our southern border, tremendous, because it's very hard to do human trafficking through ports of entry," said Trump
Trump has threatened to circumvent Congress and declare a national emergency if lawmakers can't agree to a border deal by a February 15 deadline.
Trump hinted that he might make an announcement in his State of the Union and urged reporters to listen closely to his speech.
"But actually having a national emergency does help the process," said Trump.
"It would certainly help the process. What would help a lot would be if the Democrats could actually be honest and to prove, they're not being honest. Everybody knows they're not being honest."
