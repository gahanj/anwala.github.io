Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, a potential rival for President Donald Trump in the 2020 general election, will speak during an event intended to outshine the president's El Paso rally.
O'Rourke, who gave up his congressional seat in an unsuccessful effort to unseat Texas Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz in last year's elections, made the city's safety and the need for immigration reform a major focus of his campaign.
He is now weighing whether to enter the race for the Democratic presidential nomination next year, which if successful would likely pit him against Trump in November 2020.
O'Rourke will join a march from Bowie High School, 801 S. San Marcial St., in South El Paso to the Chalio Acosta Sports Center, 4321 Delta Drive, near the El Paso County Coliseum, 4100 E. Paisano Drive, where Trump will have his campaign rally.

“I think the president’s decision to focus on El Paso and his horrible demonization and vilification of immigrants, specifically Mexican immigrants, and his desire to make us afraid of the border can work to our advantage,” he said in an interview with the El Paso Times. “In other words, as he comes down here and as he referred to El Paso in his State of the Union speech, the eyes of the country are literally on us and will be even more so on Monday.
“He’s offering us a chance to tell our story, and we’re going to take that chance, all of us,” O'Rourke told the Times.
