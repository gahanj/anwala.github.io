The abuse Pelosi has used for years using military luxury jets for her little junkets disguised as political use is well documented, yet no one in either party wanted to expose her abuse which cost taxpayers millions a year. With Trump hitting her back over cancelling SOTU, maybe now is the time to expose Pelosiâ€™s illegal use of military jets for her personal gain. It is bad enough millions have already been wasted with her personal use of these military jets commuting to Washington every other week as if commercial air travel is not good enough for her. Disgusting what these politicians have gotten away with for years, and she is not the only one abusing taxpayers. PERIOD
