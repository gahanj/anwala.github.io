Americans with a full set of teeth and a healthy disdain for Liam Neeson tried to warn the rest of the massive amount of dummies that Trump wasn’t for y’all, either. Of course, that didn’t stop the midwestern MAGAts from running to the polls to vote for the reality TV charlatan who had no foreign policy skills but did manage to handle both Clay Aiken and Arsenio Hall on The Celebrity Apprentice, so there is that.
Now, several Trump voters are in their feelings after doing their taxes and realizing that the president’s signature tax cut plan was a really a cash grab for the rich.
