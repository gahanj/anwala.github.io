The administration wants to issue the order before Mobile World Congress,  Politico reported  Thursday, citing three anonymous sources. MWC 2019, the world’s largest mobile industry show, runs from Feb. 25 to 28 in Barcelona.
The order, which was  previously expected  in January, would have a major impact on Huawei and ZTE even if it doesn’t name them specifically. The two Chinese mobile giants have been accused by the US government of posing national security risks.
The White House wants to get the order out ahead of Mobile World Congress to highlight the importance of cybersecurity in contracts for tech infrastructure, Politico noted.
This comes after a report that the US State Department is  discouraging European countries  from using equipment made by Huawei in their 5G rollouts — the latest step in the  saga surrounding that company .
Neither the White House, Huawei nor ZTE immediately responded to requests for comment.
In August, Trump  signed a bill  prohibiting the US government and its contractors from buying certain equipment from ZTE, Huawei and other Chinese companies, prompting some universities to  review and replace  gear.
