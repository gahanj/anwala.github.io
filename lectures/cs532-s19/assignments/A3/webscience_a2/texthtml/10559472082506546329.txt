Set on the ruins on Robert the Bruce's Castle, the Turnberry lighthouse has been heralded as a legendary beacon to passing ships and to golfers from across the globe. When it comes to luxury cottages in Scotland, there is none that surprasses the Lighthouse Suite.

Experience the lavish Scotland villa that is the Lighthouse Suite. Elegant in its decor and grand in its aura, the Lighthouse Suite offers breathtaking views across the Irish sea to the Isle of Arran and beyond. There is a large and lavishly furnished living room with an extensive private terrace for the enjoyment of al fresco meals or drinks or simply to contemplate one of the world's most iconic views. Above are two bedrooms, each with its own bathroom and terrace access.
