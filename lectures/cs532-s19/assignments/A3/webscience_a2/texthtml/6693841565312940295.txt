Back when Paul Manafort’s lawyers redaction fail first revealed that Manafort lied about sharing polling data with Konstantin Kilimnik, someone made the following claim to the NYT :
Both Mr. Manafort and Rick Gates, the deputy campaign manager, transferred the data to Mr. Kilimnik in the spring of 2016 as Mr. Trump clinched the Republican presidential nomination, according to a person knowledgeable about the situation. Most of the data was public, but some of it was developed by a private polling firm working for the campaign, according to the person.
Given what appears in the breach hearing transcript , that appears to be a totally blatant lie. And Manafort’s lawyers appear to have made similar cynical lies in that hearing to deny what Manafort had actually done.
For reference, here are the other filings on Manafort’s breach:
The data was incredibly detailed
The discussion of the polling data starts on page 82. Judge Amy Berman Jackson starts by noting that Manafort tried to deny the data had been shared and claimed at one point that it was just public data.
He said it just was public information.
Later in the hearing, when Manafort’s lawyers suggest that this was mostly public data — part of the claim that someone leaked to the NYT — ABJ asked then why the pollster (this is probably a reference to Tony Fabrizio, whom Mueller met with in the weeks before Rick Gates flipped and after Gates first revealed that they had shared the data) was making so much money.
In response, Richard Westling, from the same defense team working so hard to claim this was public data, then wildly shifted, arguing that the data was so detailed it would be meaningless to someone like him. In response, ABJ notes that that’s what makes the sharing of it so important.
But, as Weissmann lays out, not only had Kilimnik worked for Manafort (and therefore with this pollster, Fabrizio) for many years — so would know how to read the data — Manafort walked him through the data at the August 2 meeting.
Later in this exchange, ABJ has an ex parte discussion with the prosecutors, to see if something she’s been made aware of can be shared with Manafort’s lawyers. Remember: she is also presiding over Sam Patten’s case. Patten worked with both Gates and Manafort, and was working with Kilimnik in this period. He not only might be able to corroborate the data-sharing story, but he would be able to help Kilimnik use it, even if the years of working with Manafort hadn’t already prepared Kilimnik to do so himself. When Patten submitted a status report on December 31, it was filed under seal; his next status report is due on Monday.
The data was shared with multiple people, which Manafort considered a win-win
Andrew Weissmann lays out that Manafort ultimately admitted that the data would be shared both with a named individual and with some other entity. And he describes Manafort considering the sharing of that data to be a win-win, perhaps suggesting that it might help Donald Trump, but even if it didn’t, it would get him work in Ukraine and Russia down the road.
Weissmann returns to that — sharing this data, for Manafort, was a win-win, unless the fact that he shared the data subsequently became public.
Mr. Manafort had said there was no downside to Mr. Manafort doing it.
[snip]
MR. WEISSMANN: And meaning all of this is a benefit. The negative, as I said, was it coming out that he did this.
Of course, now it’s public and Manafort is willing to lie himself into further prison time to try to downplay that he shared detailed polling data with someone the FBI maintains has ties to the same Russian agency that hacked the DNC right in the middle of the campaign.
Update: JL notes that neither of the two Ukrainian oligarchs identified by NYT’s leakers, Lyovochkin and Akhmetov, fit the 9-character redaction after “Mr.” in the last screen cap. But “Deripaska” does. And we know this meeting was specifically focused on Kilimnik reporting back to Deripaska. In addition, Deripaska’s plane was in NY just after the meeting.
Manafort and Gates shared the data on August 2, not in the spring
At least according to ABJ’s understanding, Gates and Manafort shared the data not in the spring (as claimed to the NYT) but at the August 2, 2016 meeting at the Havana Club, to which — discussion elsewhere made clear — the two men came and left separately, emphasizing the clandestine nature of this hand-off.
ABJ’s understanding is backed by several Gates’ 302s, which must also correlate with emails that, per ABJ, corroborate Gates’ account.
Even before ABJ made that point, Westling appears to suggest that what Gates shared with Kilimnik was the most recent data.
One other reason this is important — but which didn’t get mentioned in this hearing: Manafort shared incredibly detailed polling information with someone who has ties to GRU a month before GRU went back to hack Hillary’s analytics. So they had very detailed data from both sides.
Kevin Downing twice attempts to render a jury verdict against Gates
Manafort’s team, generally, tries to claim that the sharing of polling data is just a matter of Gates’ word against Manafort’s, in spite of there being emails involving Manafort himself on sharing the data (and, apparently, emails showing whom Kilimnik shared them with).
But when ABJ notes that the poll data hand-off happened at the August 2 Havana Club meeting, in a fit of desperation, Kevin Downing claims that this all depended on Gates’ testimony and ABJ shouldn’t take anything he said as true because the jury found he totally lacked credibility. ABJ warns him twice not to go there.
MR. DOWNING: Your Honor, one other point. I know this Court hasn’t had the opportunity to review the testimony, probably, of Mr. Gates from Eastern District of Virginia, but he was found so incredible by the jury that a juror said to the press that they completely disregarded his entire testimony. So to the extent that this Court would cite Mr. Gates as any evidence, I think a review of the findings of the jurors in EDVA should be undertaken because if he is not corroborated —
THE COURT: Don’t. Don’t.
MR. DOWNING: Your Honor, it’s a fact.
THE COURT: I’m not going to base anything on what one juror said to the press.
In spite of having been warned once, Downing again returns to what the juror in EDVA said later in the hearing.
MR. DOWNING: And I will admit, on my end I won’t take it as a failure on my part because I did not think this Court wouldn’t take into consideration the fact how he was found to have no credibility at all by the jury over there.
THE COURT: You cannot keep saying that.
MR. DOWNING: I can keep saying it, Your Honor, because it’s true
THE COURT: First of all, you’re asking me to make a determination about what 12 jurors concluded because of what one juror was quoted in the paper as saying, which right now I don’t even have in front of me. But I believe she said we decided to vote on whether or not we could find him beyond a reasonable doubt, putting his testimony aside, which is different than saying we agreed, as 12 people, that nothing he said was true.
MR. DOWNING: That’s — that’s —
THE COURT: That’s totally different.
MR. DOWNING: I disagree with you. But I could go and get the press account of that.
THE COURT: I don’t know. I don’t have the press account. The press account is not evidence.
Downing floats bringing ABJ the press account himself, but then suggests he could provide the transcript. ABJ even offers to call Gates before her to testify.
Over lunch, ABJ goes on her own to find that press account. And, as she explains immediately after lunch, she doesn’t agree with Downing’s reading of it. Indeed, she calls it hyperbolic.
I went back and read the article that I believe I read at the time and, indeed, there was a juror who spoke publicly. She spoke publicly because she said she wanted the public to know that while she wanted Mr. Manafort to be not guilty, the evidence was overwhelming.
She indicated that the only reason he was not convicted on all counts was because of a lone holdout in the jury. She did not attribute that to Mr. Gates’s credibility. And reportedly, she did say, as I thought I recalled, some of us had a problem accepting his testimony because he took the plea. So we agreed to throw out his testimony and look at the paperwork. And then she added, I think he would have done anything to preserve himself, that’s just obvious in the fact that he flipped on Manafort.
So, I don’t believe — there’s certainly not anything in this record for these proceedings, or the public record, for that matter, that supports your argument that I should consider the fact that the jury unanimously concluded he was a liar, as was reported in the press by a juror, and threw out his testimony. I don’t believe that that is what the newspaper articles reported. Not that I would have relied on the newspaper article or what happened in the Eastern District of Virginia anyway, but I believe your argument was a little hyperbolic.
Manafort’s lawyers knew about this allegation because they tried to air it during the EDVA trial
In addition to trying to claim that this matter just pits Gates against Manafort, Manafort’s lawyers try to claim that Gates only made the claim about sharing polling data last fall, late in the process of his cooperation, meaning that they didn’t have an opportunity to prep their client on it.
I may be wrong about this, but we have a note — a September 27th, 2018 interview which we did not see until this submission was made, where Mr. Gates makes that statement.
Mr. Weissmann has suggested we had all of Mr. Gates’s 302s where he said this previously. I don’t think he said it before that interview. And so as far as we know, that’s new testimony from Mr. Gates compared to what he said in prior proffer sessions, where I think he said something more like it was more what was publicly available.
Weissmann corrects that by noting that at a proffer on January 30, 2018, Gates laid all that out.
Mr. Weissmann, with respect to the specific argument that they just made that this was a new twist by Mr. Gates, only in the 302 that they most recently received, do you have anything you want to add to that, respond to that?
MR. WEISSMANN: Yes, I do. So, I would direct the Court’s attention to Exhibit 236, which is a 302 with respect to Mr. Gates, and the date of that is January 30th, 2018.
He later notes the two 302s from early in Gates’ cooperation where that came up (it was actually January 31, not January 30).
In any case, after first raising Gates’ proffer from January mentioning Manafort sharing this polling data, Weissmann notes that Kevin Downing called attention to this during the EDVA trial.
Back in September, I suggested that Greg Andres’ success at getting this sidebar sealed probably had something to do with Manafort’s willingness to take a fairly shitty plea deal. It was a big fucking deal at the time. And the notion that Kevin Downing — who tried to get the information in the public record at the trial — is now claiming he didn’t know about it is simply contemptuous.
Manafort lied about sharing data with a Russian asset in hopes of getting a pardon
And this is where what appears to be at least the second reference in the hearing to Manafort’s hopes of getting a pardon appears (by context, this is almost certainly Weissmann, though the transcript labels it as Westling).
Manafort knows well what he did in August 2016. But he — and his lawyers, and whoever lied anonymously to the NYT — continue to lie about it in hopes that, by refusing to confirm that he conspired with Russia to get Trump elected, Trump will pay him off with a pardon.
The truth appears to be that Manafort walked Konstantin Kilimnik through recent, highly detailed polling data at a clandestine meeting in NYC on August 2, 2016, in part because even if it didn’t help Trump, it might help his own fortunes down the way. And he’s willing to bet that lying about that fact is his best chance for a pardon.
Update, from the comments: Eureka notes that the same night Manafort shared campaign data, probably with Oleg Deripaska, Stone defended him, insisting he was doing “everything humanly possible to help” Trump.
Aug 2, 2016 09:59:24 PM The idea that @PaulManafort is not doing everything humanly possible to help @realDonaldTrump win is patently false [Twitter for iPhone]

I will include the disclosure whether or not the stuff I shared with the FBI pertains to the subject of the post.

What if Trump was dumb enough to surround himself with idiots…Stone, Manafort, etc., and those idiots helped Democrats and loyalists in their (dems) attempt to take down Trump?
Trump figured out Manafort was crooked…late in his campaign:       from Wikipedia
On August 17, 2016, Donald Trump received his first security briefing…two days later, Trump announced his acceptance of Manafort’s resignation from the campaign 
Trump got woke up August 17, 2016….nothing has been the same ever since.Then he SOMEHOW got elected…and an investigation is STILL ongoing…and many people involved in dem’s coup attempt and subsequent cover-up will be exposed soon.  I give it 2 to 3 weeks. I see “regular joes” (like me) connecting dots all over social media now.
Deripaska, John Kerry, Susan Rice, Hillary Clinton, Victoria Nuland, Henry Kissinger, the U.K., Australia, Bill Browder, Bill Clinton, McCabe (maybe flipped), Comey (maybe flipped), Lisa Page, Strzok, and many more…maybe EVEN Obama himself.

Not surprisingly, the NY Times article conveys a ridiculously naive and cursory sense of what polling data might be.
It’s possible it was nothing more than a simple state by state breakdown of Trump supporters by gender, race and age. But the Times should have done due dilligence in explaining how specific it can get and how much it can be integrated with messaging strategy.
And if the Trump campaign had already handed over other data — voter databases, identifications, and messages, then this so-called polling data becomes much more — it is potentially a guide to which specific messages to use, who to target, and when to reach them. It is more like the blueprints and detailed instructions an architect hands off to a builder, not a simple drawing of a new addition.
“Polling data” may be the latest version of “adoption policy.”

emptywheel –
boy! i am really confused now – by the title of this post if nothing else. are you saying mr. m. never shared data with kilimnik? apparently not. or is it just that the date of the sharing was aug not “spring”? or is it that the data was “public”, i.e., publicly known because published and discussed for any and all to know?
as for the trump campaign manager’s  “selling out” his candidate, do you mean that that manager was free lancing with no thought the campaign would benefit? is it that this was m’s way of paying deripaksa back? i would never be surprised if manafort (or trump) sold someone put, i just don’t see it here yet from the extant text.
paul manafort was the trump campaign’s manager thru august 19, 2016. is it your belief that he was not working for the benefit of the campaign when he shared the polling data with kilimnick on aug 2? do you believe that manafort had no suspicion or knowledge at the time of the russian social media campaign? i realize i sound like an attorney but it is important to get the details of this meeting right and i am confused at the moment. what is the “totally blatant lie”? “public” when not.

Kevin Downing’s a real piece of work.
Check out Lucifer’s Banker by Bradley Birkenfeld for how duplicitous he’s always been. People like him, Trump and Manafort do seem to be birds of a feather sharing a narcissistic sense of entitlement and a casual disregard of facts and the truth.

now i can ask a question i’ve been wanting to ask since the previous post yesterday on this matter. does paul manafort qualify as a spy for sharing this polling data with a russian military officer? if he were sharing say, manufacturing details of a boeing passenger liner with, say, a chinese gov’t “dep’t of commerce” employee he might well be. but what about the campaign manager for a newly certified u.s. presidential candidate?
i’m a believer in the patrick fitzgerald approach of finding the simplest, most unambiguosly culpable, easiest to understand charge and sticking with that for conviction. 2-3 years in prison is a sufficient instructor. i’m satisfied with sco’s charges, but manafort’s breech of faith with the american people tempts me toward at least talking about far more serious charges.
does paul manafort qualify as a spy
So are you asking if Manafort should be charged under 22 USC 618 – Agent of a Foreign Principal (which he was) or under 18 USC 951 – Agent of Foreign Government (which is what Maria Butina was charged with)?
If you’re asking about 951 I wonder if we wouldn’t see an indictment of Konstantin Kilimnik at the same time to solidify the link — and we’d have to see something more specific in the indictment about Kilimnik’s relationship to Russia as an agent.
The counterintelligence investigation may not be helped by a criminal charge now.

Since a couple commenters asked, here’s my take on…The sell out was Manafort testifying to the Grand Jury that he gave the Trump campaign data to Kilimnik/GRU by way of the Ukrainian Oligarchs.
Mueller’s team called it a win-win from Paulie’s perspective. A win if it helps Trump because he would get the genius points and/or points for playing ball giving the data to his handler and the Russians so they could bash HRC good and proper in all the low places.
Anyway, that’s what I think.

Were Manafort’s lawyers always this bad? I can’t tell if they were bad to begin with, they’re just getting worn out with this case (because their client is already in jail, has already been convicted of multiple felonies by what appears to have been a sympathetic jury and a sympathetic judge, has already taken what most people agree is a lousy plea agreement, and is now accused of breaching the terms of his plea agreement–seriously, how many lawyers get stuck with a client who is this far in the hole?), or they’re having trouble keeping up with both their client’s line of bullshit as well as their own.
And are we still in the dark about who’s footing the bill for Manafort’s lawyers?
At this point, I don’t understand why they’re even bothering. He’s either going to prison for most (if not all) of the rest of his life, or he’s getting pardoned and then immediately getting hit with state charges. All his legal team is doing right now is reducing the chances of a pardon. He’d be better off getting his lawyers to take the maximum prison sentence in exchange for his choice of the prison he wants to potentially spend the rest of his life at. That would at least have the benefit of getting him out of the Alexandria jail and into a nicer facility. What makes Manafort’s case different from everyone else’s is that Manafort is already in jail. There’s not much benefit for him to drag out all of his legal maneuvers.

i think ew’s current write up suggests that there may be no reason now to expect a pardon. i would think trump might issue a pardon even under these circumstances because so long as manafort challenges gates’ recollection and does not give a reaffirmation of his testimony in open court of the polling data exchange with russia, there is a hole in the collusion story that allows for uncertainty, ambiguous interpretation, and cries of “fake news” from the loyal until hell freezes over, but once pardoned one assumes manafort’s lips are sealed forever. however crippled a nag, legitimacy and history ride on this issue.

plus the locations of pockets of such folks which are key to swinging a close election, how to manipulate those so vulnerable to actually turn out if ‘for’ the party you want to boost, or decline to vote if ‘for’ the party you want to suppress, as well potential factors available to exploit within those locations (which, of course, being able to view of their Facebook pages could assist in identifying).
There are places in the country where conservatives will vote D if they identify that same preference with their local D candidate (e.g. ‘respectfully’ or institutionally conservative, say in support for The Troops or farmers or fiscal restraint versus identifying the local R candidate as a fire-breathing radical white supremacist crazy person – there’s no shortage of R candidates who fit that or encourage or at least allow voters to assume that’s who they are). Such voters would seem to me vulnerable to being at least moved off or ‘de-incentivized’ any enthusiasm of voting for a moderate mainstream candidate, even conservative or at least traditionally institutionalist in her policies, if her opponent were to spend several weeks of rallies pointing to at her showing up a little late for a candidates’ debate because she’d had to go the washroom.

thanks. i was actually thinking of keith gartenlaub’s case in as much as he was an employee of an american corporation who was suspected of spying for the chinese (though he ended up getting nailed by doj on questionable childporn charges).
a political campaign is not a corporation, but it is a formal, legal american organization and manafort was its chairman, its CEO, at the time of the data “transfer”.
But while Manafort may have operated within the campaign under a title, he was not compensated by the campaign. He may have been compensated by some other entity/ies — in which case, appropriating any campaign material without the express consent of the candidate for use by some other entity sure looks illegal.
Unless the candidate had given Manafort to act carte blanche on half of the campaign…which means the candidate has exposure, too.
Mmm. Messy.
EDIT — shouldn’t have hit my mouse. Anyhow, I think the question is at what point does Trump try to pardon Manafort? If he doesn’t attempt it will Manafort rat him out (because Manafort surely knows, being partner to King Ratfucker for as long as he was)? Or will Trump try to blame Manafort for any conspiracy and leave him in the can and hope Manafort can’t rat him out?
I want to know where Pence is in all of this. Could Pence flip on Trump, offer a conditional pardon after X number of years served if Manafort offers to rat on Trump and helps get Trump impeached+removed? Very soap opera-y but here we are, tinfoil is back in fashion.

says:
I’ve puzzled over the question of the timing of pardons. I have thoughts but no conclusions, of course.
One puzzle is why is Trump waiting? He’s not a patient man, nor is he a trusting one. He must know the longer he waits, the odds increase that someone cracks.
There is the issue of pardons being part of an obstruction case, but it’s unclear to me if they’re a make or break issue, and it also seems like obstruction is an issue pretty far down the list of worries for him.
There is potentially some political fallout, but if there was a time to get it over with, December would have been the time to do it.
I wonder a bit if Trump is holding off because he wants to keep his conspirators sweating longer out of pure curdled spite. Trump may also hate the idea of Manafort getting out if he is still in danger.
I’ve also wondered if he doubts pardons will matter — he may have a sense that his goose is cooked even if every Russia related charge falls short. A slam dunk paper trail case may have fallen into SDNY’s laps when they seized Cohen’s records, for example.
Trump may also know that Mueller has broken the Russia case far enough that Manafort doesn’t really matter, and now Trump is just dangling a pardon insincerely as a damage control exercise.
It’s also possible Manafort has been playing coy with Trump about what information he still holds, and the two of them are locked in a stalemate. Manafort may be saying “pardon first, then I’ll tell you what I have” and Trump may be insisting Manafort tell him what he’s been keeping from Mueller before he decides if it’s pardon worthy Neither side may trust the other enough to go first. I wouldn’t trust Trump if I was Manafort, or vice versa.
It’s also possible Manafort wants more than just a pardon that Trump can’t or won’t deliver. He may want Trump to talk to Russia to get all of his overseas obligations taken care of as soon as he gets out of prison. He may be haggling over a payoff.
I’m sure there are other ways to go in the garden of forking paths that I haven’t considered.
— May not poll well ahead of 2020;
— Looks obstructive (because it is, of course);
— Issue of legality – can president’s pardon power overcome his own status as an unindicted co-conspirator in at least one case? (Cohen’s not getting a pardon for campaign finance law violation, IOW);
— President can’t pardon crimes in advance or in progress.
That last one’s a kicker because I think the conspiracy is still under way and Manafort in particular may still be working on crimes related to the campaign.
I’m sure others will have more input and suggestions.
BobCon
says:
The last one is definitely an interesting one.
I’d love to find out some day if this is something simple, like Manafort has millions squirreled away in illegal accounts and there is no way to bring them home in the future without committing a crime — or if it is something more complicated that is connected to ongoing Russian interference.

Thanks for the article. Knowing that data was shared can be corroborated by how the influence campaign was conducted. Knowing what types of voters were targeted, and where they were located, and who did the targeting would confirm the sharing of data.
The final step would be compute the likely number of voters who did not vote, or switched preferences, and that affects whether the results of the election were legitimate.
I don’t see a way to get that data to the public with an order from the judge presiding over the grand jury to disclose the evidence.
To me, Congress seems to be a branch of government, and a disclosure seems consistent with Rule 6(e), but apparently there is a difference of opinion on that question.
Thanks again.

“I think it’s highly unlikely that anyone in the campaign okayed (or was even aware of) the handover of the campaign data, so the initial “selling out” would have been Manafort handing over the campaign data in the first place…”
that statement is probably formally true if for no other reason than i would never expect an experienced operative like manafort to go to his principle and tell him or ask him about doing something so highly improper.
but that does not mean manafort did not have clear approval from candidate trump to work with the russians in any way helpful to the trump campaign. it is the case that the campaign had already, on june 9, 2016, effectively exchanged a letter of intent with the russian federation for a deal involving russian help in trump’s presidential campaign in exchange for relief from american economic sanctions. trump was unquestionably aware of this agreement as he was of the trump tower moscow bribery effort.
manafort could easily have seen his polling data exchange as a reasonable request to the russians for specific assistance in the upcoming 2 month (labor day until election day) battle for the presidency knowing that trump would repay the russians if he won, which trump did in fact proceed to do working thru general flynn.

Well, if the leakers to NYT are Trump administration (Trump, Rudy, etc) then why reporters whould write such articles?
NYT reporters know who their sources are, so they knowly help Trump to advance his naratives. But why would they do it?
If Trump/Pecker can blackmail/extort Jeff B., anybody potentially is exposed.
Maybe Jeff B. investigation and the other investigations will uncover some of these shenanigans.
Every single time I see somebody defending Trump with hyperbolic naratives I ask myself if they are trying to cover their own corruption acts, or they were extorted, forced based on dirt on them or family.
There has not been one inocent person so far that defended Trump.

Update: JL notes that neither of the two Ukrainian oligarchs identified by NYT’s leakers, Lyovochkin and Akhmetov, fit the 9-character redaction after “Mr.” in the last screen cap. But “Deripaska” does. And we know this meeting was specifically focused on Kilimnik reporting back to Deripaska.
This strikes me as being pretty significant. If Manafort’s camp was intentionally leaking an incorrect date for the polling data meetup (information which itself became public via his lawyers’ redaction ‘fail’) to NYT and trying to obfuscate on Deripaska’s acquiring it (by keying in on the two Ukrainian oligarchs instead), that looks like a pretty direct signaling to the White House that Manafort has the collusion evidence and will be expecting to be “made whole” if he’s to continue sitting on it. Then within a week, the White House forces through the lifting of sanctions on Rusal (and other Deripaska companies), despite congressional opposition, and having misrepresented both Mnuchin’s own conflict of interest and the actual financial effect on Deripaska. Sounds awfully quid pro quo.

one can ask oneself how it is that a person like trump who is notorious for continuing to support questionable people who he has nominated and needs, e.g., flynn and kavanaugh and whitfield, despite public criticism, would so easily cast manafort aside. an answer i will provide is that trump violated his “support and be damned with critics” inclination because he wanted to take all precautions to insure that during the upcoming campaign, the public did not learn of his agreement with putin.

I’m still trying to figure out how this relates to the Corsi/Stone correspondence August 2nd (It’s time to let more than Podesta to be exposed…/Hillary sick), and the publicly-issued Manafort kill switch August 2 evening. Was Manafort’s handing off of the polling data the trigger for the press complaint/staging by a ‘longtime ally’ of his– i.e. this job complete, time to move on?
I’ve commented on this article before, in the context of an (apparent/possible) operation to extract Manafort and replace him with Bannon/Conway:
Ally of Trump staffer Paul Manafort: The staff is suicidal, he’s mailing it in
Published 10:24 PM ET Tue, 2 Aug 2016
but later noticed something interesting in the tweet about it (830pm ET)- or rather the replies.
John Harwood: “longtime ally of Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager: “Manafort not challenging Trump anymore. Mailing it in. Staff suicidal.””
at 633am ET August 4th, distinct from the other replies, is this from Texans for Trump @ TrumpResults/status/761148088329183232:
“Americans concerned about Hillary’s health issues.” (followed by an url that reads radaronline . com /videos/hillary-clinton-coughs-health-concerns-video )
It makes me think of a linked theory of mind as to why that reply would go to that post, though other explanations are of course possible.

Also, these people are all terrible.
I’ve looked for a transcript of that bit just because it’s given me so much pause. Whitaker’s face doesn’t read like he had already been coached to say that and yet I can’t help thinking this bit about pardons was deliberate as hell, a communication intended to tell those operating under plea agreements or indicted or soon-to-be-indicted that Trump has already prepared pardons.
Did we watch more of the obstruction and conspiracy even while we thought we were watching an oversight hearing?
SC
says:
Ms Escobar asks her question about pardons at 5:58:45.
Yes, his answer does seem oddly, um, happy, I guess. I’d guess, his long pause and almost-smiling response happened because her question is worded in such a way that he can answer it without stumbling or lying. Maybe.
(Unless I missed an earlier exchange,) Whitaker’s very brief answer to Escobar’s question “Did you ever create, direct the creation of, see or become aware of the existence of any documents relating to pardons of any individual?” is, in full: “I am aware of documents relating to the pardons of individuals, yes.” The thing that struck me at the time was: She asked about “any individual” and he volunteered “individuals” when he didn’t have to to affirmatively answer the question. After watching it again, it’s unclear to me if it means anything. I guess it might.
(Just an aside but: Watching a slice of the hearing again was not an uplifting experience. I get that members have diverse concerns and I know they don’t all have legal experience but there were many loosely worded questions by the Dems and little apparent coordination, at least compared to similar hearings run by the GOP. There was little follow up and fine-tuning of questions as Whitaker stumbled and showed weaknesses. The pardon question is a good example of a missed opportunity. Why didn’t Nadler follow up, given Whitaker’s response? I know that time was running out but but even just “Tell me more! How many? Have any of the pardons been related in any way to the administration?” would have been useful. If he lies, he’s on record lying. Why did Escobar and Nadler waste time on questions that, very soon, Whitaker will have no involvement in?  Sadly, the Dems let Whitaker get away with a lot. And while the GOP clearly had no interest in pursuing serious questions, Collins and Jordan were sadly effective in using their time to coach Whitaker through dissembling and distracting.)

@Rayne – Right??? The clip I posted from CSPAN captures the deer-in-headlights ‘OH SHIT’ expression on his face. Escobar was smart enough to ask about documents, not conversations, and you can see from the look on her face that she knew she’d nailed him.
Why no one in the MSM picked up on this is… well. Just disappointing.
(Also, the popcorn discussion yesterday got me thinking about sriracha butter & we made sriracha butter roasted cauliflower tonight and goddamn.)
This was such a near thing, the very last question just as Rep. Escobar’s time was finished. What if Nadler hadn’t let her ask this last question?
Nadler: TIME IS EXPIRED. I WILL LET HER FINISH THIS ONE QUESTION.
Escobar: 04:15:24 DID YOU EVER CREATE, DIRECT THE CREATION OF, SEE OR BECOME AWARE OF, THE EXISTENCE OF ANY DOCUMENTS RELATING TO PARDONING OF ANY INDIVIDUAL?
Whitaker: 04:15:44 I’M AWARE OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO PARDONING OF INDIVIDUALS, YES.

By August 11th, Trump was talking like an owned, passive object as regards the campaign.  I read this as a sign he had been ‘read-in’ enough to know that he and the campaign were in others’ hands.  He was questioned by friendlies (e.g. Bolling at Fox) about his lack of GOTV apparatus.  TPM and WaPo wrote up some of the details re Trump’s relative campaign deficiencies, more details at links.
“One of the big things about the RNC is they have this whole infrastructure of data and information and contacts and email lists and mailing lists and phone numbers. That is something that is important to your campaign,” Bolling said. “That’s not at risk. Is that in jeopardy at all?”
“I don’t know. I will let you know on the ninth, on November 9th,” Trump replied.
“We are gonna have tremendous turnout from the evangelicals, from the miners, from the people that make our steel, from people that are getting killed by trade deals, from people that have been just decimated, from the military who are with Trump 100 percent,” he went on. “From our vets because I’m going to take care of the vets.”
“I don’t know that we need to get out the vote,” the Republican nominee concluded. “I think people that really want to vote, they’re gonna just get up and vote for Trump. And we’re going to make America great again.”
(emphasis added)
In an interview with Fox News noted by Talking Points Memo, Trump dismissed the idea of having a get-out-the-vote (GOTV) operation like the one described above.
…
But it’s also clear that Trump’s campaign is far behind past campaigns (and his opponent) when it comes to setting up GOTV operations. There is one campaign office in Florida, a tenth of what one former head of the party in the state told Politico he would expect to see. There is no field office in southwest Ohio; Mitt Romney had four by early June 2012. As of June, Trump had just over 70 paid staff. Hillary Clinton’s campaign had over 600, many dispersed to battleground states.
(internal links removed)
His owned-man chill sounds like someone who is relying on the work of others to get him elected, and meh – if not, no skin or hard work off his nose.  Unlike how he normally speaks of himself publicly, he talks like the passive object of others:  what TPM, e.g., called ~ ‘a newly conciliatory approach towards a potential loss.’
Then on August 12th, Trump gives his Altoona stump speech, which I refer to as the Altoona Looney Tunes speech where he goes ‘full Manafort Ukraine’ on the tactics, asking for police-type officials to monitor polling places as opposed to just ordinary citizens.  Shortly thereafter, he talks to the Mercers et al. at a Hamptons party, with a story ‘per sources’ throwing Manafort under the bus as trying to constrain him and his style as the given reasons why Bannon and Conway come on later that week.

@Rayne -Also, I hadn’t read the exchange quite the way you did – about BDTS using the question to send a message to Paulie et al. Which is even worse than what I’d been thinking.
Instead, I read the exchange as Escobar getting BDTS to publicly admit that yes indeed, he’d seen pardon paperwork, which is a red flag that Trump is preparing to pardon his loyalists, which in my mind should have everyone going ‘WAIT WHAT THE FUCK?’
Instead, resounding silence from the media. AAAARGGHHH.

i keep thinking about the data sharing and Cambridge analytica (also Israeli company Psy Group) – together with the odd database traffic between Alfa Bank, Spectrum Health, and the Trump campaign. Spectrum health is headquartered in Grand Rapids Michigan and has close ties to the DeVos family. They have healthcare facilities in Wisconsin, Michigan and PA. So: health records likely have names, street addresses and email addresses. Look at it all together and you know where people vote (name and home address) and what their likely hot-button issues are (FB account tied to email address, issue analysis from CA or Psy Group).

First post after several months of lurking. I’ve been curious about something ever since first learning Paul Manafort was advising trumpster-fire, just before he was named as chairman of the campaign: isn’t it obvious that his time in Ukraine, helping Yanukovych get elected, was directly related to the sudden shift in GOP’s Russia stance? The parallels between these two campaigns just got stronger and stronger over the 2 1/2 years since those pre-2016 election days.
I’m constantly confused and surprised that MSM do not draw those lines with more clarity. Please forgive my lack of detail, but wasn’t Yanukovych’s election won with help from Putin? Didn’t Manafort help craft their ethno-devisive rhetoric? Didn’t Yanukovych immediately threaten NATO withdrawal and then borrow a ton of cash from Russia? Doesn’t it now seem even more likely that his election was a trial run for our election? Is it not likely that Paulie gave Putin polling data to help him ‘engineer’ Yanukovych’s election?
I wish this wasn’t my first post, and I do sincerely apologize for jumping in with conspiracy theory blather on a site that has so effectively told the the story with facts and established sourcing, but why do we not hear about this on a daily basis in the MSM?
Is it that I have been fooled by poorly sourced articles or is it that such theories are so basically at the core of the story that they are no longer necessary to discuss? Please forgive my unsourced questions. Thank you all for being here and holding your journalistic standards so high. I will now go back to holding my breath/tongue/blather.

The reason this is all so confusing is that we’re all assuming that the Russians had Trumpy from the beginning.  Now, that may be still be true.
If that’s true, then all of this Manfort reveal is the crucial point when the Russians started figuring out that trump could actually win.  That would have changed the nature of the Moscow deal in interesting ways.
If trump wasn’t always on board, then this is a backdoor attempt from Manafort above and beyond what the campaign was willing to do.  He’s lying about it because he doesn’t want to piss trump off (keep his pardon in play).
If trump is mad at manafort in this scenario, then it gets interesting.  How will a newly scorned Manafort cooperate?  is it too late?
I hope this helps, guys.
Also, it’s still possible that Manafort saw this as a side grift, where he could earn additional favors and work off debts and Trump didn’t know he was doing this… but, they were still knee deep in other scams.
I personally have a hard time believing that trump is clean or will come out clean.  He was “sold out” by a fellow crook who didn’t cut him in, most likely.

Yeah, vote suppression, strategically employed, was the essential strategy since clinton was unambiguously favored  nationwide. This would have been obvious to the russians who knew american politics well enough to manipulate voters as well as to american political practitioners.
But where to employ the strategy? That would be where understanding the peculiarity of the electoral college, together with up-to-date polling data would have been important in deploying the emotional vote suppression tactics that social media like facebook make possible. Mass coverage was unnecessary; targeted messages would have been the weapon of choice, as trump’s media guy perscale and the russians both clearly understood.
Afer the election i believe it was discovered that dem voting, compared to 2012, was off by 12,000 votes in milwaukee and by about 50,000 in the suburbs around philadelphia. I don’t recall a similar summary for michigan, the third state that put trump over the top in the electoral college (but i know of some folks here who almost certainly do :) ).
The peculiarity of the 2016 near-philadelphia results is highlighted by the fact that two years later in the 2018 election the congressional seats around philly changed from republican to dem, as did numerous local offices – a near revolution for that area.
It is important to keep in mind that the russians had a lot riding on this election if trump won – economic sanctions relief. Finding a some means to help trump get elected would have had very high priority.
Getouttahear @7:11 above cites the jane mayer study of the 2016 election.

Sam Penrose: Slip of the keyboard, perhaps: “contemptuous” -> “contemptible”.
Nothing wrong in the original.  contemptuous = showing contempt, contemptible = deserving contempt.  Both are good adjectives describing Kevin Downey’s behaviour, but in ew’s context above — trying to pull the wool over ABJ’s eyes despite her clear warnings — contemptuous is more directly apropos.

If someone could clarify on redactions, please:
On page 138 of the breach hearing transcript, discussing redactions, ABJ mentioned items “completely redacted at every point prior to this and will continue to be.”
Let’s say we have two individuals, A and B. The decision is that A should remain redacted but B can appear in the public [redacted] transcript.
Does that mean B’s identification relates only to this transcript, or B will be named in some/all documents going forward?
Is there any consideration to revising documents previously released to publicly name B when previously redacted on these specific discussion points?
Let’s say A and B were part of the same event (meeting, email, etc.). Is it possible B would be redacted in the portion of the transcript dealing with A, but named everywhere else mentioned? Or if you’re publicly named, you’re named everywhere?
Thanks to everyone for your continued enlightenment.

— are they all the documents Schiff wants,
— are there documents Schiff can’t readily have because they are related to an ongoing counterintelligence investigation and not a criminal investigation,
— is Schiff providing cover by fulminating out loud in public about this when Schiff may already know all of the above?

I’m not certain what Schiff’s aim is because the last time the DB document request hit the news, Trump had a fucking tizzy and there’s nobody in the White House now who can restrain him if he goes off again. I don’t know if Schiff is hoping Barr’s near-term approval will put him in a position to push back but it’s a pretty stupid gamble since Barr could do little more than be fired or quit to stop Trump’s likely tantrum.
Unless Schiff is trying to goad an expedited approach to impeachment by poking Trump. I don’t think the House Dems are ready to work together as cohesively as they should to that end based on their performance in the House Oversight Committee hearing with Whitaker.

@Leila512: there’s still ambiguity over whether Parscale has been interviewed by Mueller’s team.
We know that he had an Assange poster (“Dear Hillary, I Miss Reading Your Classified Emails”) on the wall of his campaign “bunker”, that he described his digital strategy as “voter suppression” (i.e. aimed at potential Clinton voters), that he spent a shitload of money on Facebook ads (with Facebook employees embedded in the team), and that he had the credentials for his boss’s Twitter account, which points to “Twitter for iPhone” tweets in 2016 coming from him or Scavino (or others).
(Note that the iPhone tweets spell “Wikileaks” correctly, when the Android tweets spell it “Wikileakes”.)
So there’s very good reason for Mueller to talk to Parscale and Scavino… unless they are targets.

One thing I can’t quite square from the transcript: Paulie’s lawyers thought there was value in raising the Kilimnik meeting in Gates’s EDVA cross-examination based on discovery of his 302s, but Weissmann is probably right to argue that putting it in the public record would have “negative consequences” on a pardon, assuming that the campaign was unaware that its internals were being shipped to Deripaska.
So: was it that Paulie and his lawyers had already prepared the backstory they supplied to the NYT and wanted to make it Gates’s word against his unless Mueller’s team were willing to introduce other evidence?

So Manafort provided Kilimnick, whom the FBI assesses has ties to Russian intelligence, with detailed polling data on August 2nd at the Havana Room in NYC at 53rd and Fifth Avenue.  The timing is very interesting – let’s not forget what happens the next day at Trump Tower – Don Jr meets Erik Prince, George Nader and Joel Zamel at Trump Tower to discuss proposals to help the Trump campaign win the election (Jr reportedly rebuffs Zamel’s written proposal, per NYT).  Sorry in advance for the long post – this thought has hit me like a bolt of lightening after vociferously tracking this corrupt story for 2+ years now.
Writing this in the middle of the night because I just thought of this and can’t get this out of my head: Trump does not seriously believe he will win the GOP nomination or the presidency (more focused on making money / branding), until early June.  Up and through end of June, the illicit focus of the campaign has been Hillary’s emails.  By end of June, Trump campaign must get all of their ducks in a row for the GOP convention in mid-July.  Democratic convention occurs a week later, Wikileaks releases emails on convention eve, etc.
By the end of July, the Trump campaign could reasonably conclude that (1) there will be more leaks of embarrassing Democratic emails by the third-party holders of said emails and that some actors hostile to Hillary would proceed on this basis (I don’t recall, when did Rebekah Mercer tell Alexander Nix to have Cambridge Analytica index the stolen emails for Assange?), and (2) Trump, now with the GOP establishment behind him, desperately needed to bolster its ground game and its digital operation to stand a change against Hillary on Election Day.  I.e. By the end of July, procuring votes and data (or suppressing votes, saying nothing of the Democratic voter analytics stolen by Russia which Roger Stone called “pretty standard”) became just as, if not more important, than finding Hilary’s emails…indeed, the Trump campaign needed to be more active with the latter, and could be passive with the former.
Below is a timeline threading some of these points together.  Two questions for the board in case anyone has educated guesses on these two points: (1) when would the Trump campaign data operation have obtained access to the RNC/GOP data files? and (2) when precisely was Cambridge Analytica brought-in to assist the Trump campaign (surely, the answer to this second question is no later than mid-August when Bannon comes aboard).  As we all know, Jared Kushner and Brad Parscale were running point for Trump on their own data operation.
May 26, 2016. Trump officially wins the GOP primary.
June 3, 2016.  Rob Goldstone first emails Don Jr. with the offer of Hillary dirt as part of “Russia and its government support of Mr. Trump.”
June 7, 2016. Trump promises to give a speech the following week on all the terrible things the Clintons have done.  The speech never occurs.
June 9, 2016.  Trump Tower meeting occurs.
Sometime in June, 2016.  Kushner begins overseeing all Trump campaign data efforts.  “Within three weeks” from this time, Brad Parscale’s team running “Project Alamo” is in the triple digits. https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2016/11/22/exclusive-interview-how-jared-kushner-won-trump-the-white-house/#382955873af6.
Also sometime in June 2016.  Cambridge Analytica and Brad Parscale/Trump data team have an initial meeting. https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/21/politics/trump-campaign-cambridge-analytica/index.html.
July 27, 2017.  Trump delivers the infamous, “Russia, if you’re listening…” speech.
August 2, 2016.  Manafort (with Gates) provides Kilimnick with polling data at Havana Club.
August 3, 2016.  Don Jr, Erik Prince, Stephen Miller, George Nader and Joel Zamel meet at Trump Tower to discuss efforts to assist the campaign.
By mid-to-late August 2016, NYT is still describing Trump’s get-out-the-vote and digital operation as “bare bones”. https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/22/us/politics/donald-trump-fundraising.html.
Anyway, sorry for the long post.  Hope readers here found this as interesting as I did thinking it over.  This thought / timeline hit me when I thought about the whole election interference “the other way around” for the first time — i.e., as evidenced by the Trump Tower meeting, the Trumps clearly first looked to Russia for illicit election interference.  Shortly after that meeting, they became frustrated that Russia would not deliver them the actual “goods” around the same time that they realized they actually needed to field a competitive general election campaign and mature data operation.  They therefore sought alternative (non-Russian) means of assistance but were pleasantly surprised once Wikileaks started releasing DNC emails on the eve of the Democratic convention.  The Trump campaign realized they could turn their “active” assistance solicitation away from Hillary/DNC emails towards something else, hence a flurry of data operations activity from mid-June to early August.

exactly 2 weeks later, on august 2, 2016 trump campaign manager paul manafort was in new york having a meeting with russian intelligence agent konstantin kilimnik. the topics included at least discussion on settling the russian-ukranian conflict that had been bubbling for several years, on economic sanctions the u.s. had imposed on russia, and on detailed gop polling data.
on aug 19, manafort was fired as trump campaign chair and nominally left the campaign after news reports appeared about his long history of working for pro-russian ukrainian politicians. manafort’s assistant rick gates stayed with the campaign thru election day.
it seems reasonable to assume that by removing manafort quickly trump was trying to insure that questions would not arise about any associations his campaign might have with russia.

However fast the Twitterscape reacts to such revelations, the old fashioned person to person formation of opinion is working differently. Eventually family conversation will conclude Trump had permanent COI.

I keep thinking about the data analytics operation Pascale and Kushner spoke so openly about before the election. They said they knew how to target messages at the micro/voting precinct level. How did they tie the voter records (street addresses) to the FB records/psychographics to analyze hot-button issues? Enter Erik Prince and Betsy DeVos.
The DeVos family has close ties to Spectrum Health. Health records include name, street address AND email addresses. FB uses email addresses. Voila! If you combine that data and feed it to Cambridge Analytica or Zamel’s Psy Group you now know who to target and what messages to use. Spectrum Health had that very odd database activity with Alfa Bank and the Trump Campaign.
Oh – my fave part of this? Spectrum has facilities in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.
Oh, the health care database — that’s an interesting angle. Thanks for sharing that!
EDIT — afterthought…wonder if it would be worth mapping all the health care insurance breaches across the country to see if there’s a pattern based on Congressional races. Hmm.

Woah! This is interesting. Enough coincidences not to be a coincidence :)
Thanks.
STG this is like the fourth comment asking about Facebook/Cambridge Analytica/SCL/user data in the last 12-18 hours.
I doubt these issues have “slid off the investigative table” since the Russian Internet Researcy Agency’s troll farm has already been indicted.
It’s important to think of Facebook data as social MEDIA. There will be First Amendment issues complicating investigation into Facebook even if they say they aren’t a news provider. It’s also important to think about the scope under which the Special Counsel’s Office is authorized. What people may want to have happen to Facebook/Cambridge Analytica/SCL may not happen through SCO; should we trade off hammering the entities which hacked and manipulated data or should we hammer on the witting/unwitting distribution system?
And frankly, the public needs to do a better job of creating a theory by which social MEDIA can be regulated without infringing on First Amendment rights. There hasn’t yet been a solid theory of data privacy and personal data as commodity legislators can use to beat back the likes of Facebook/Cambridge Analytica/SCL short of cloning EU’s General Data Protection Regulation .
That said, I think this House of Representatives needs to look at Facebook’s testimony to Congress and punish him if he made false statements. This is low hanging fruit.

Later in this exchange, ABJ has an ex parte discussion with the prosecutors, to see if something she’s been made aware of can be shared with Manafort’s lawyers. Remember: she is also presiding over Sam Patten’s case. Patten worked with both Gates and Manafort, and was working with Kilimnik in this period. He not only might be able to corroborate the data-sharing story, but he would be able to help Kilimnik use it, even if the years of working with Manafort hadn’t already prepared Kilimnik to do so himself. When Patten  submitted a status report on December 31, it was filed under seal; his next status report is due on Monday.

Further sealed filings — a joint status report — in Sam Patten’s case, per a gov’t filing this afternoon. // Background: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/a-dc-lobbyist-linked-to-players-in-the-russia-probe-has …
