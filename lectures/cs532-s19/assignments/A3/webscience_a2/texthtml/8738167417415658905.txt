Sen. Elizabeth Warren formally announced her candidacy for the White House on Saturday, and hours later President Donald Trump weighed in on his newest campaign opponent, appearing to make a joke with reference to the Trail of Tears.
Soon after the Massachusetts senator's campaign announcement, Trump tweeted:
“Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President,” he wrote on Twitter. “Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!”
Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!

The president's use of the word trail in all caps is a potential reference to the Trail of Tears, the forced relocation of Native Americans from their homelands in the Southern United States to reservations in Oklahoma in the 1800s.
Thousands of Native Americans died during the event.
Andrew Jackson was the president who signed the Indian Removal Act into law in 1830. Trump picked a portrait of Jackson for Oval Office in 2017.
In January, after Warren posted a video on Instagram saying that she was forming an exploratory committee for a presidential run, Trump tweeted:
"If Elizabeth Warren, often referred to by me as Pocahontas, did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen, with her husband dressed in full Indian garb, it would have been a smash!"
Warren apologized on Wednesday for "not having been more sensitive about tribal citizenship" after The Washington Post published a 1986 Texas bar registration card where she listed her race as "American Indian."
It was at least the third time in a week that Warren has apologized for her past self-identification.
