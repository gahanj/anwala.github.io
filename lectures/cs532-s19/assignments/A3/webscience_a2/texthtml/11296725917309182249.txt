Stock market rise and fall means little and even though all politicians like you to think there is a correlation to economy, it is over hyped and has little to do with actual economy. Trump will point out stock market rise just as all politicians will point out positives whether deserved for credit or not, nothing new. For those who are invested, or have 401Kâ€™s or pensions, it is a positive for these people, but is not an indicator of economic strength.
