The weather was so warm for a couple of days last week that I decided to take a few hours off to work on my tan.
I especially needed to get rid of those pale, half-moon patches under my eyes. They stand out like big flashlight spots in the middle of my face.
I got them when I gave my pair of sunlamps to the chickens, who complained that they were cold. My mid-winter tan touch-up wasn’t finished, but the coops were in fact pretty chilly when the temperature dipped into the teens or single digits. So the birds got some warmth, gathering under my lights at night, but I was still walking around looking like some kind of weird owl.
Thinking a dose of real sun would help, on Tuesday I dug a folding beach chair out of the lawn shed, took it down to the pond and set it up where I could sit and stare directly into Old Sol. No need to worry about UV rays at this time of the year, I thought — it’s early February and the sun is still low in the sky, even in the middle of the day. I could leave my bottle of Coppertone on the shelf and instead take a jug of lemonade and a bag of chips to keep me company.
I situated myself in a spot where the tall weeds of last summer had been matted down by the raccoons and the oversized snapping turtles that patrol the little lake. I took a long drink of lemonade, a big handful of nutrition. Ah, peace.
I marveled at the tranquility all around me. No mosquitoes to swat, no flies coming over from the coops to check me out. The chickens were providing a nice backdrop of sound, clucking quietly as they took advantage of the thaw to peck around in the mud and goo of their outdoor yard.
Since it was midday, no school buses were grinding their way up and down the rise and fall of the road nearby. No drivers heading to work were careening past trying to find a shortcut around the stoplight traffic jam in town. The only intrusive sound was the Asplundh truck on the other side of the field disgorging another load of ground-up tree branches, but that noise was of my own doing — I had invited them to dump there so I could get my supply of wood chips rebuilt.
As I let my mind drift I got to thinking that maybe there was something to this idea of “executive time” after all. Donald Trump is in the news again because of his less-than-overload daily things-to-do lists. But his aides say he needs those big vacant blocks of time in his daily work schedule to think things through, to compose his tweets and to mull over the advice, insights and judgments of his friends Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity.
Sarah Sanders says people who say he’s lazy are getting it all wrong. He’s the hardest-working president of all time, she and other aides maintain, working even harder than Millard Fillmore. He plays golf now and then, but he doesn’t waste nearly as much time as Thomas Jefferson did putting around in his garden, or as Harry Truman did playing the piano, or as Ronald Reagan did chatting with his astrologer.
So I decided to do a little brain work myself, to let my mind — free, at least for a few hours, from the stress and strain of daily farm work — just noodle around a bit, sneaking up on problems obliquely, from different angles. Direct, frontal assaults sometimes blind you to other possibilities.
Remarkably, it worked. I had a new vision, an awakening, when I was stirred from my reverie by the sound of twigs snapping on the other side of the pond. Opening my eyes, I saw a young deer, a yearling, stretching her head and neck down to get a drink of water. She was lovely — tawny, slim and doe-eyed, as does tend to be.
Why was I always at war with creatures like this? So what if they ate my beans, shredded my cucumber vines, reduced by squash plants to rubble? And so what if they nibbled off the tops of my new broccoli and cauliflower? Why did it matter that they always chomped down my sweet corn, the day before it was ready to pick?
I had tried to keep them out with wire fences, electric fences, double fences. It didn’t work. What I needed was a wall, a tall wall, a steel wall. Something fearsome, awesome — beautiful, in a word. The deer would know they’d met their match, and no matter how hungry they were, they’d give up and go away.
The solution was so obvious, so clear, so simple. A wall would be expensive, maybe even unsightly, but you have to do what you have to do. The Great Wall of China worked, didn’t it? And it even became a tourist attraction. People from the world over travel great distances to go look at it.
This “executive time” thing is a good idea, I thought. It’s not laziness, it’s creative. I dozed off, happy and satisfied with myself. Maybe I really am a stable genius.
