Later this year, babies who were not even born when the 9/11 attacks happened in 2001 will be old enough to sign up for military service and go lose a foot, an eyeball or their very lives in the same old fight that’s still going on in Afghanistan.
According to Congress, the American people need to continue sending our best and brightest to the meatgrinder in Afghanistan – and Syria (!) – forever and ever, with no end in sight.
The US Senate just voted 68-23 to continue dumping American blood and treasure in the sand of a nation that shows no signs of adopting democracy or indoor plumbing anytime soon.
All of us were filled with patriotic fervor when the 9/11 attacks happened. We wanted to deliver some much-deserved payback to the cowards who flew airliners into the World Trade Center towers, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field.
Here we are, almost 18 years later. Osama bin Laden is (allegedly) dead. Afghanistan’s infrastructure is permanently smashed and will likely never recover until the people of that nation decide to get their act together.
The other nations of the world have been hoping that this will happen for the past couple of thousand years, to no avail.
Afghanistan now has the highest infant mortality rate in the world – by far – and the Taliban are still sneaking around in the vast wasteland and deserts, biding their time for us to leave.
Why are we still there? Would any of us have agreed to this if we had been told in 2001, “Oh, and by the way, we’ll still be sending soldiers to die in Afghanistan long after Osama bin Laden is dead and the war has been won?”
We’ve lost another 37 American soldiers in Afghanistan since Donald Trump was elected president, including 3 this past January. Lord knows how many additional soldiers have been grievously maimed since then, just so Clinton Foundation donors like Boeing, Raytheon and James Comey’s former employer Lockheed Martin can continue to make money hand-over-fist.
A lot of us on the conservative side of the fence fell for a stupid argument back when we first wanted to kick Afghanistan’s rear end: “We need to fight them over there, so we won’t have to fight them over here!”
Little did we know that the joke was on us. It turns out that there is another effective way to not have to fight Taliban members, Somali pirates and Syrian warlords in America.
Stop bringing them over here as phony refugees and giving them useless TSA jobs at the airports!
Meanwhile, as Congress votes to send everyone else’s kids off to die in Afghanistan, Syria and Somalia forever, it just so happens that there is a far more violent, dysfunctional and dangerous threat to America out there in the world… and it’s right on our southern border!
Since the Mexican drug cartel war kicked into high gear in 2007, there have been an estimated 80,000 civilian casualties in Mexico as a result. That doesn’t include the astonishing 70,000 deaths every year that America is suffering thanks to the illegal drug trade that easily pours across our wide-open southern border.
We lose more Americans to illegal drugs from Mexico every year than we lost in the entire Vietnam war. Doesn’t that seem to be a slightly more urgent national security problem for America than protecting poppy fields in Afghanistan?
How about if we survey the troops to see which tour of duty they would prefer? You can go to Afghanistan where there’s no clear mission objective, no end to the conflict in sight and any random person on the street could detonate themselves and suddenly end your life, or… you could protect the homeland on the US southern border (preferably from behind a giant, concrete wall) where there’s clean drinking water on demand and R&R in Las Vegas is just a short drive away.
Congress seems to be hopelessly gridlocked on some of the issues that mattered the most to voters in 2016.
Obamacare repeal? Can’t be done!
Deporting DACA signups? Too cruel!
Building a wall on the southern border? Too expensive!
Fine, can we hang up a “Mission Accomplished” banner and bring the boys home from Afghanistan at long last? Oh, look! Bipartisan unity!
