HOO BOY: Rob Lowe’s joke about Elizabeth Warren’s title if she’s president is NOT going over well on the Left
Posted at 11:54 pm on February 9, 2019 by Doug P.
Rob Lowe imagined a Warren presidency — specifically her title — this way:
Elizabeth Warren would bring a whole new meaning to Commander in “Chief”.

And with that, a great triggering ensued…
Look at all the #sjw heads exploding over this gentle ribbing of Senator Red Face.
Because nobody is allowed to laugh at anything ever.

Looks like someone is bring whole new meaning to Rob "Lowe" amiright https://t.co/cxY8OjTZv6
Well, you get the idea.
Warren’s bogus ancestry claims don’t hold a candle for many to anybody who makes a joke about them, apparently:
It's amazing how many people to seem to think jokes about Elizabeth Warren pretending to be Native American are more offensive than Elizabeth Warren pretending to be Native American. https://t.co/GDuZ34pFq9
Rob Lowe here is trending on Twitter because people are so outraged over the fact that someone would dare point out Elizabeth Warren's claims of Native American ancestry, and use it as a funny pun. https://t.co/Xit5tLOtn0
If only people could be as outraged at @ewarren for lying about her ancestry as they are at Rob's joke. https://t.co/8c8ajzv5rE
If only.
