Donald Trump is perhaps best known for the money he's made (and lost) in real estate, his less-than-humble demeanor and his hit reality TV show, 'The Apprentice'. In recent years, the business tycoon has also been chasing the dream of holding the highest office in the land.

Watch as Donald, in a 1988 appearance on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show', shares his thoughts on running for office. For more on #oprahwinfreyshow , visit http://bit.ly/1ODj0x7
