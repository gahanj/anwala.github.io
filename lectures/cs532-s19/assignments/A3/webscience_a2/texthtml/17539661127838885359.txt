Trump attended the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America’s Youth Initiative in Maryland, where she highlighted her work as part of the "Be Best" campaign with babies and others affected by the opioid epidemic.
"You are our greatest agents for change," Trump told attendees in prepared remarks. "Through your voices, you have the power to influence, transform, and lead your communities from within."

The first lady noted that one of her guests for Tuesday's State of the Union  was Ashley Evans, a recovering addict who found help through a program in Ohio called Brigid's Path.
"Recovery is possible," Trump said. "It is because of programs and organizations like Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America or Brigid’s Path that offer care, resources and essential tools that can save lives and teach positive and life-saving ideas to those in need. These programs are so vital to our nation and within our communities."

Following her remarks at the event at National Harbor, the first lady was set to attend a policy briefing at the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
Trump has in recent months  visited local hospitals  and met with students to discuss the opioid epidemic and cyberbullying, two main areas of focus for her Be Best campaign.
