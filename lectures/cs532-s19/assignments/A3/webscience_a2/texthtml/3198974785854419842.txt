A Hinsdale accountant — code name “Combover” — stole millions of dollars from a wealthy Chicago family and used the money for a luxurious lifestyle that included buying three condos in the Trump International Hotel & Tower .
Those are the allegations prosecutors levied against Sultan Issa, who they say stole $55 million from his former clients. Issa served for years as the personal accountant to the family of Roger Weston of Winnetka, who sold GreatBanc to Charter One in 2006 for $180 million.
Issa, who is charged with one count of wire fraud, bought the Trump Tower units through LLCs using the name “Combover,” an apparent knock on President Trump’s hair, according to the Chicago Tribune, which first reported on the charges. Cook County property records show the Combover LLCs purchased units on the 35th, 64th and 79th floors, along with a parking space.
In addition to the stolen millions, prosecutors say Issa used fraudulent documents to secure at least $83 million in loans for himself, sometimes using Weston family property as collateral. He also stole $8.8 million from other investors by claiming he would invest it in ventures including a high-end auto dealership he owned in Burr Ridge, according to the charges.
Issa used the money buy 25 residential properties in Illinois, Montana, Michigan, and Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, along with two private jets, four yachts, about 60 guns as well as watches and jewelry, prosecutors said. [Chicago Tribune] — John O’Brien
