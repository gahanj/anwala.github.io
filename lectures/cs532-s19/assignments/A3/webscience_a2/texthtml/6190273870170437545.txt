Trump was quick to criticize Schiff (D-Calif.) and the investigation, which he called "presidential harassment" and a continuation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's "witch hunt." He also warned that other Democratic committee chairs could launch their own investigations of his administration.
So now Congressman Adam Schiff announces, after having found zero Russian Collusion, that he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life, both financial and personal, even though there is no reason to be doing so. Never happened before! Unlimited Presidential Harassment....
....The Dems and their committees are going “nuts.” The Republicans never did this to President Obama, there would be no time left to run government. I hear other committee heads will do the same thing. Even stealing people who work at White House! A continuation of Witch Hunt!
On "Fox & Friends First" Thursday morning, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton agreed with Trump that the House Intelligence Committee's new probe is a continuation of the "abusive investigations" already underway.
"The Democratic National Committee [and] the Hillary Clinton campaign manufactured this Russia collusion unicorn theory, and Mr. Schiff is taking it up, and he's going to keep on his party's abuse of power to target President Trump," Fitton argued.
He said Schiff doesn't have the ability to issue FISA warrants against the president, but he can attempt to subpoena him and his administration, and also "fish around" in Trump's personal finances.
He said Schiff essentially becomes "political opposition lead researcher" for whichever Democratic candidate emerges from the primary to take on Trump in the general election.
Fitton said Trump's phrase "partisan investigations" was actually a charitable description of what he's facing from Democrats.
"It's a slow-motion coup attempt. They want to overthrow him. And Democrats have this fever dream of impeachment, and Schiff is setting the groundwork for it."
