'SNL' mocks Jeff Bezos' National Enquirer photos: 'Is he working with an Amazon Echo or a Dot?'

This week's episode of 'SNL' mocks Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. USA TODAY
The Jeff Bezos blackmail scandal combines tawdry details about genital size with a potential quid-pro-quo tying into the Trump-Russia investigation. Therefore, it's a story that's irresistible to the media and therefore, "Saturday Night Live."
The show addressed the story first thing upon returning from its two-week break in a spoof of NBC's "Meet the Press," with Kyle Mooney as Chuck Todd, joined by a roundtable of some of the country's most decorated journalists: Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson (Kenan Thompson), Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan (Cecily Strong) and Donna Brazile (Leslie Jones), the former chair of the Democratic National Committee.
Whatever you think of the New York Post's journalism, you can't hate on their headlines.

Now, one might expect serious journalists like them to focus on the part about a tabloid blackmailing the world's richest man and how it might cost National Enquirer publisher David Pecker the immunity deal he signed with Robert Mueller. Nope, all they wanted to talk about was the size of Bezos's package.
"When I hear billionaire's penis, I immediately think small potatoes," said Noonan. "It's like they say – if it's small, it looks funny, you better have the money, honey."
Robinson went with an Amazon product analogy: "As a journalist, this is not something I ever thought I'd have to cover, but as a human being I'm naturally curious," said Robinson. "Is he working with something the size of an Amazon Echo or is it more of a Dot?"
Jeff Bezos accused  American Media Inc. (AMI) of blackmail and extortion and 'SNL' won't let him live it down.

Nothing could get Todd and his guests off the topic of Bezos's anatomy – not even Tuesday's State of the Union address or acting  U.S. Attorney General Matt Whitaker 's (Aidy Bryant) dropping a potential bombshell about President Trump directing him to interfere in the Mueller investigation.
Why should Kate McKinnon have all the fun? Aidy Bryant donned a suit and bald cap to play atcting attorney Matthew Whitaker.

The burly, bald Whitaker told the "Meet the Press" host that once his three months as AG are up, he'd soon return to his day job of "breaking up fights on 'The Jerry Springer Show.' "
Just as Whitaker was about to reveal what Trump had told him, Todd interrupted him to announce the Bezos photos had been released.
"Ohhhh!" Robinson exclaimed. "Christmas in February!"

"You all see why I have to fake this national emergency, right?” Alec Baldwin said at the top of “Saturday Night Live” on Feb. 16, mocking President Trump’s Rose Garden speech announcing his latest gambit to get his border wall. “I have to because I want to.” The skit irked the real occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, who tweeted, "THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!"

Appearing as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Kate McKinnon made light of his a comment in which he advised furloughed federal workers to take out loans to tide them over rather than seek help from food banks. "That was silly of me," her Ross deadpanned. "I simply meant there are other ways to get money, like liquidating their stocks or selling a painting. Even a lesser Picasso will get you through a week or two of yacht maintenance."
The shutdown humor didn't end with the Fox News sketch. A "Deal or No Deal" parody featured President Trump (Alec Baldwin) trying to win funding for his proposed border wall by playing "Deal or No Deal." Manning the briefcases: singer Cardi B (Ego Nwodim), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Kate McKinnon) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Alex Moffat).
