I shared a copy of the memo with Law Director Barbara Langhenry, who dismissed the complaints in it as not representative of the “dedicated and skilled lawyers” on her staff.
Cleveland’s salaries trail behind the those of city lawyers in Akron, Canton, Cincinnati, Columbus, Dayton, Toledo and Youngstown.
Langhenry, who has spent much of her legal career in the department, did not dispute the figures and said lawyers hired by the city are fully aware of the pay scale.

CLEVELAND, Ohio — Browns receiver Antonio Callaway had his marijuana charge dropped, his lawyer Kevin Spellacy told cleveland.com .
His charge for driving with a suspended license was amended, and he pleaded guilty to speeding Oct. 14th in Strongsville, going 58 mph in a 35 zone, in a hearing Jan. 25th.
That’s how minute it was and at the end of the day, they knew they had a problem proving a case against him that he knew he possessed marijuana which he didn’t know.’’

A versatile multi-instrumentalist, Tork mostly played bass and keyboard for the Monkees, in addition to singing lead on tracks including "Long Title: Do I Have to Do This All Over Again," which he wrote for the group's psychedelic 1968 movie, "Head," and "Your Auntie Grizelda."
