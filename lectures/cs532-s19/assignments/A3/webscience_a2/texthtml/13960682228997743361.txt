Here’s the latest from our commander-in-chief:
Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!
If you had asked me ten minutes ago, I would have sworn that Donald Trump had never heard of the Trail of Tears. But apparently he has. What’s more, he thinks that this episode in our obscene genocide of American natives is something worth joking about.
I suppose that by tomorrow Sarah Sanders will have invented some alternate story about why TRAIL is in all-caps, and then chastise us all for immediately thinking the worst of Trump and being so ultrasensitive about everything.
FACT:
Mother Jones was founded as a nonprofit in 1976 because we knew corporations and the wealthy wouldn't fund the type of hard-hitting journalism we set out to do.
Today, reader support makes up about two-thirds of our budget, allows us to dig deep on stories that matter, and lets us keep our reporting free for everyone. If you value what you get from Mother Jones, please join us with a tax-deductible donation today so we can keep on doing the type of journalism 2019 demands.
