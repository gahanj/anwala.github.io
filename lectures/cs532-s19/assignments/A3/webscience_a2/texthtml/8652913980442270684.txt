The supreme leader of Iran is defending his trademark “death to America chant.”
During a rally Friday, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said he will keep chanting “death to America” as long as the U.S. acts “maliciously” toward the country.

The supreme leader also said his verbal attacks are not a threat against everyday Americans, but rather a threat against President Trump and his cabinet.
“U.S. authorities complain and ask why do Iranians say: ‘Death to America’ — let me make something clear for U.S. leaders, ‘Death to America’ means death to President Trump, National Security Adviser John Bolton, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,” stated Ayatollah. “It means death to American rulers, we have no problems with the American people — ‘Death to America’ is about the rulers of America, it’s about the group of people who are currently in charge.”
His remarks seemed to come in response to President Trump’s State of the Union address.
