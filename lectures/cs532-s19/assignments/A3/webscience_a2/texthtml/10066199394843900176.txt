The main argument that Democrats, the media and Hollywood nimrods use to prove collusion is the meeting at Trump Tower and the Russians in attendance.
But, every Russian at that meeting is tied to Hillary, not to the Trump. They are tied to Fusion GPS, the company that Hillary and the DNC hired to write a fairy tale now known as the Hillary dossier. There are several fishy things you have to look at and if you do, there is no way you could believe this was not a setup.
From The Gateway Pundit: Dan Bongino recently shared on his podcast facts about the meeting at Trump Tower –
This meeting’s a set up. It’s a set up! It’s a set up! It’s a scam! It’s a set up”
Bongino laid out how the entire meeting at Trump Tower was a set up. The ‘Russians’ involved were all connected to Hillary Clinton.
On FOX News, California Congressman Devin Nunes, who sat through hours of testimonies related to the Trump – Russia farce, said the following –
… but something also probably important to note about the so called Trump Tower meeting. This is the meeting that actually Fusion GPS met with the people before and after that meeting.
Fusion GPS, once again, was a Clinton Campaign paid for operations outfit. They were clearly involved in the set up of the Trump Tower meeting. So if they want to bring Cohen in and talk to him, that’s great, we’ll participate. But the truth, if you really want to get to the truth behind the Trump Tower meeting, Fusion GPS and the Clinton campaign are all over it, and probably behind it.

The testimony before Congress by Rinat Akhmetshin is the most telling. What was the object of the meeting? To change US policy via the Magnitsky Act, which sanctioned several Russian oligarchs. Assuming that’s what they wanted, look at his testimony:
The Trump Tower guests claim they wanted to affect government policy.  Trump Jr. responded by saying, hey, we’re just in campaign right now.  We aren’t government. We can’t do anything for you. Come back to us “when we win.” Meaning you’re talking to the wrong people. We have no power to do anything for you on this subject right now.  But Akhmetshin’s response is not what you would expect from someone who wants to affect government policy.
Take special notice of Jr.’s words: “WHEN we win.” What was Akhmetshin’s response to that boast?
“Yeah, right,” Whatever….
That means that Akhmetshin didn’t think they had a snowball’s chance in hell of winning….so then, ummm, why were they there then?
And why do we think Fusion GPS was involved in the meeting?
The night before the Trump Tower meeting, [Glenn] Simpson [from Fusion GPS] had dinner with another client,  Natalia Veselnitskaya . He had dinner with her again the night after the meeting, he told Congress. [Veselnitskaya was at the Trump Tower meeting and is suspected of working for Simpson.]
This is one of the many things we need a second special counsel to investigate.
