(5 Feb 2019) White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said President Trump would use his address "to call for an end to the politics of resistance, retribution."
"He's calling for cooperation," she said, adding that Trump will point to examples of where this has happened on his watch. Officials said the president is also expected to highlight infrastructure, trade and prescription drug pricing as areas in which the parties could work together.
