(CNN) â€” President Donald Trump had an insult and a warning in his State of the Union address when he said "we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country."
It was a warning because he suggested the US could follow the same path as Venezuela, which despite its oil riches has become an unstable country.
It was an insult since he was suggesting Democrats want to take the US toward socialism, which has long been thought to be a dirty word in US politics.
"America was founded on liberty and independence --- not government coercion, domination and control," Trump said. "We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country."
Get used to this topic. Trump used it repeatedly in November as he campaigned for Republican candidates and its inclusion at the State of the Union address suggests he'll be bringing it back as the 2020 campaign ramps up. Here are some of the ways Trump has used the specter of socialism, including about Venezuela, as an argument against tax hikes, as part of a pledge to protect Medicare, and as a dream for his ideal opponent.
