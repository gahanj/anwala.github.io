Judd Trump can make a bit of personal history on Sunday at the World Grand Prix if he can continue his exceptional run of form in Cheltenham.
The 29-year-old takes on Ali Carter in the final of the Grand Prix and can claim his third title of the season, an achievement he has never managed before.
Trump has already lifted the Northern Ireland Open and Masters trophies this season and is hot favourite to add the 2019 World Grand Prix to his collection on Sunday evening.
Victory for the Masters champ will also see him climb to number four in the world rankings, overtaking John Higgins, thanks to the £100,000 first prize.

Trump found himself 5-4 down in a race to six in his semi-final with Hawkins but battled hard to get over the line.

He made breaks of 52 and 95 in the final two frames to reach the final, but knows he will have to improve against Carter.
‘I got back level and ahead in the frame, but I gave him easy chances which was disappointing. I felt maybe my concentration wasn’t as good as it has been in the past so it’s something I need to work on for the final,’ Trump told Gloucestershire Live.
‘It was a really tough game I had to come from behind all of the time. I didn’t really start off too well either so really happy to get over the line.’

Ronnie O’Sullivan is the only player to have won three events so far this season, having claimed the UK Championship, Shanghai Masters and Champion of Champions.
Judd now has the opportunity to join him on that number of trophies with just a little over two months until the World Championship begins in Sheffield.
Standing in his way is Carter who is in his first ranking final since 2016 and is a little surprised to have made it this far in Cheltenham.
‘It would be a little bit surreal to win on Sunday. I am in the final now. I have so much going on behind the scenes at the minute,’ Carter said after his semi-final win.
‘To be in the final I feel a bit punch drunk. I will look forward to it.’

The two men have a very even head-to-head record with Trump winning 11 and Carter 10 of their 21 previous meetings.
However, Trump goes into this one as the runaway favourite with the bookmakers with Betfair pricing him at just 1/4 and ‘The Captain’ out at 11/4.
The final is played over two sessions on Sunday 10 February, starting at 1pm and 7pm.
