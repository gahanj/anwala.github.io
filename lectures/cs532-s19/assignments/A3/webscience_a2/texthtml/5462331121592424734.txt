The ‘Viareggio Carnival’ in Italy celebrated its 147th year by featuring a gigantic float of U.S. President Donald Trump dressed as the “God Emperor” – a meme that went viral during the 2016 presidential election.
YouTube channel Gab Pac  uploaded a video showing the Trump float in action:
Revelers can be seen dancing and celebrating in the streets as the float moved its arms, head and even eyes.
Here are a few interesting observations about the insanely-detailed float:
Much of the float’s costume was most likely inspired by the popular tabletop game Warhammer 40K ( see Emperor of Mankind )
Trump is wearing a Roman-style laurel wreath crown on his head
On his right shoulder pauldron can be seen what appears to be either ancient Roman Emperor Julius Caesar or Russian President Vladimir Putin as well as a hammer and sickle (so, probably the latter?)
The chest piece and left pauldron both feature an eagle with its wings spread, along with a Lovecraftian-themed coat of arms
His right hand is gripping a sword. The hilt features a round sun-like object with a triangle in the middle ( all-seeing eye? ) There are also Twitter bird logos “flying” around the hilt’s guard. The blade has the inscription “DAZI VOSTRI” which is Italian for “Your Duties”
Trump’s left hand is a “Power Claw,” or a giant powered gauntlet (h/t Emprah)
On his left knee is the Statue of Liberty’s face and on his right knee is (possibly) former U.S. President Ronald Reagan
