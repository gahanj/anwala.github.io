INTRODUCTION
241 years ago, the Founding Fathers did something no prophet, seer or revelator saw coming.  They formed a government on the belief that human rights come from God, not from the king.  Ever since that moment, dark and terrible powers have been trying to destroy America.
This book is about the rise of the most powerful crime syndicate politics has ever seen.  Hundreds of people have been murdered, including world leaders, witnesses, reporters, and even presidents.   A Deep State Coup is currently underway to destroy President Donald Trump.  America has been invaded, and the Republic is under attack.  The terror plot in this book is as real as it gets.
America won a major battle on November 8th, 2016, but the war is not over.  Based on actual events, this book is a true story of the rise of the Clinton Crime Syndicate told from the eyes of my own characters.  You may cry.  You may laugh.  You most certainly will be awakened to the reality of just how dangerous and powerful they have become.
