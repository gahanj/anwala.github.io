Call them the tremendous Trump trifecta.
Donald Trump’s daughter Tiffany Trump, 25, attended the Taoray Wang runway show with her mom, Marla Maples (who was married to Trump from 1993 to 1999), during New York Fashion Week on Saturday. Alongside the duo in the front row was former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is dating Donald Trump, Jr.
Maples, 55, wore a dramatic ivory suit and told The Post that her daughter Tiffany is burning the midnight oil as a student at Georgetown Law.
“She’s working so hard,” said Maples. “I’m like, ‘Honey, do we have time to eat?’ And she’s like, ‘No, mom, I have to study.’ That’s how it is now, but I’m very, very proud of her.”
School “is going well,” Tiffany told The Post at the show, where she sat next to her boyfriend , Nigerian businessman Michael Boulos. The couple also attended Wang’s last NYC fashion show together in September.
Guilfoyle, who attended the State of the Union speech with beau Trump, Jr. earlier this week, rocked a scarlet number by the Chinese designer.
“I think she’s phenomenal and I wear her clothes all the time,” she said. “She’s one of the more important, pivotal designers right now. Nobody is doing what she’s doing.”
