While this is so heartbreaking...it is needed for us to see the truth and brutality of this atrocious crime against the most innocent among us!
Feb 17
Thank you for this video: There is not better medicine against abortion than to see it. How could a country not bee doomed that allows it.

I myself had a abortion at 19. And there were circumstances for the reason I made that decision. Although every year the month I knew my child would have been born I think to myself my child would be the age it would be at that time. I believe in abortion as long as it's 1st trimester.
Feb 16
I have the same thoughts 19 years later. It's nice to finally see a like minded comment in this thread.

It’s sad when we can read you could afford an abortion, but you couldn’t afford the expense of birth control which would’ve prevented this horrific act. I too, was pregnant at a young age. However, I didn’t choose to force the unborn child to pay for my error in judgment. I chose to give life to a family in desperate need of a child. I don’t need to wonder what he would have looked like, how … More
Feb 18
I was on the pill, as well as on antibiotics to which my doctor neglected to tell me that antibiotics reduce the rate of the pill. Some may believe it's a horrific act. To me at the time I did what I needed to do. I do not regret it is it was the best decision for me at that time I have no guilt I have no shame.
Feb 18
How sad that you can see the brutality of dismembering babies in the womb and not feel shame or guilt... heartbreaking that it does not break your heart :(
Feb 18
Anyone that does this has something mentally wrong with them. I was 19 when my handsome, smart, amazing son was born....he has grown into an AMAZING young man.....I NEVER REGRET having him and the world is a much better place because of him. Mpayne I feel sorry for you.
Feb 19
I had to have one in my early 20s. It was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. My dr told me IF I carried to full term that odds were that it wouldnt live to see its 5th birthday. I made the decision to not put my baby through a life like that. When I told my dr of my decision he asked if I wanted to hear the heartbeat. That wasnt fair. But I feel even to this day that I made the right … More

This is the saddest thing I have ever seen! The devil is a demon! He has taken over many people. Dear God, Please make this stop! Amen!
Feb 13
This is graphic and is horrible!! But it has to be shown to stop the murder YES ABORTION IS MURDER!!! I cried while watching this and then I got mad. People get all upset over people abusing an animal and I am a animal lover. I love cats! These little babies are human. These babies are little people. God can't bless America because of the sin that is being legalized. God help America! These … More

Here we go again with sensationalized videos of fabricated stories to misinform people and tailor their votes towards a certain direction. Quit thinking strictly with emotions and start thinking critically. This is not a live video, as it was deliberately mislabeled to be, and no where in this video does it show any babies specifically being killed by the doctors. It shows dead babies being … More
Feb 12
Of course their aborted dead,,, a day or 2 before scheduled abortion the Dr. gives something that kills the baby. Also puts seaweed ( that's what Dr. calls it),, inside the female to cause the cervix to thin. Maybe you could research this!
Feb 12
Broke u aren't woke. Abortion murders a living, viable fetus. Say what you want, this is premeditated Murder 1.
Feb 13
Broke-n-woke if a baby is “born dead” they are not dismembered as the babies are in some of the images. I think you may have gone back to sleep, time to wake back up.
Feb 18
You don’t like the truth. Science is showing you. The blind cannot see the truth and live on darkness. :(
Feb 18
Broke-u-aint-woke... are you freaking kidding me... statistics say that over a million babies are aborted world wide yearly... Make no mistake most if not all of these babies in the video are ripped literally from their mothers womb alive, because the mother did not want them.... and yes by the millions... I hate that you are so blind you can not see....that we are guilty of murdering our … More
Feb 19
You dont know more any anyone else if them babies were already dead.
Feb 12
This is graphic and horrible... But these are human beings that have been brutally murdered and their lives should not have been lost in vain. We must fight for the lives of every unborn child.
Feb 13
if those devils at planned murderhood and the demorats have their way this would happen too!!!
Feb 12
This has got to stop they are murdering poor innocent babies and hurting them i mean this country has turned bad that is horrible those babies feel at that they are doing to them how mean and horrible act
Feb 11
I dont judge people that have abortions even though I personally could never do that. That being said I think it is so wrong to do late term abortions. That's something you should have done in the first few months. When your at 6,7 months that's a baby. To be put into labor and deliver the baby just to let it lay there and died should be considered murder. If someone murders a pregnant woman … More
Feb 11
I completely understand if the baby is dead in the womb why you would abort it. But there have been several cases where the doctors have been wrong about a child with disabilities not surviving. People the majority of the time just have sex for fun and dont think about what could happen. Having a baby is a beautiful thing but most people are too selfish to realize that and just think that they … More
You both are wrong and sound like the idiots. What Bkuhl is trying to say is the law will recognize a pregnant women’s fetus as an individual human being, whether the mother is early or full term, when prosecuting someone for the murder of a pregnant women. Thus charging them with a double murder. But when it comes to abortions they completely contradict themselves, changing how or when they … More
Feb 11
OK so I've read these comments and I want to say first hand I have seen a criminal case actually two criminal cases where a pregnant woman was murdered. In one the child was considered as a second murder but in the other the woman was five months pregnant and they were not charged with HR child's death. So to say that they go by heartbeat is incorrect. At five weeks I heard my own sons heartbeat,… More
Feb 18
Bkuhl...I agree with you to a degree...but what of those fully formed babies at 10-12 wks...is it not just as wrong to tear that tiny body with fingers, toes and sometimes nails...limb from limb in the womb... hell I can't pull the wings off a butterfly and you are okay with abortion at any stage...we have to have a standard of what is life... to respect...and that is at conception... although I … More
Feb 14
Ramblings from your stories don't justify ruining the lives of millions, you care about this baby now but what about when it's born, if it's gay or transgender, according to the Bible you relentlessly quote it's life then become worthless. When it's in the system discarded and forgotten by any form of care, or even resented by the parents who were forced against their will to bring it up. As … More
Feb 18
IT IS A LIFE Isobelmoore, it just has not lived one yet...the one who should be looking forward to a life with her child is now wanting to kill it ….
Where is the love of a woman aka mother who would be willing to sacrifice everything...to love and care for that child no matter what?
Do we as decent human beings not have a duty to protect the innocent from the selfishness or immaturity of it's … More
Feb 11
This is fucking stupid. For one; no, this isn’t even how abortions work, this is a completely false article. And two; for all you people saying “child killers” “Abortion is murder” “if you have unprotected sex you should have to have the baby” MIND YOURDAMN BUSINESS. Who the FUCK are ANY of you to tell ANY woman what she can and can’t do with her body. It has absolutely nothing to do with you, … More
Feb 11
I believe that the unborn is a human being to and has the same rights to life as you do.Once that life is established then its not all about you any more
Feb 11
Abortion isn't the key there are so many couples in The United States willing to adopt do the humane thing give the child up for adoption..
Feb 11
Rosie166 you said it's nobody's business what they do. And it's "her body" and she can do what ever she wants with her body. Well, the baby is not a part of her body. It is a separate body. I agree, she can do what ever she wants to do to herself, but no one has the right to kill another human being in the process. And about it being none of our business, and we need to "mind our own business", … More
Feb 11
Rosie you say this isn’t the way abortion works? How is it different. When the gestational age is older, that is exactly how it works, piece by piece, limb by limb. If a female of reproductive age doesn’t want to become pregnant, there are many ways to avoid this. One sure way is by not having sex. Abortion is not a form of birth control.
If the female wants to have sex, then use birth control … More

I have been raped, molested, beaten by exes, cheated on while pregnant and then had a miscarriage and so much more so please spare me this you don't know people's situations crap. The woman that screams my body my choice is usually the woman who is running around having unprotected sex without using any protection and thinks that abortion is the answer to her own fuckups. This is actually how … More
Feb 18
love the reply Tamrob! I sware (yes I said sware, I speak with an accent ..lol) people need to be slapped with the truth and stop defending this shit! And people need to be told they have to grow up and be responsible!
Feb 11
This is so wrong what they doing with them poor babies this is one thing I agree with the Republicans stop killing them babies if you can lay down and have unprotected sex you need to keep your child your mom didn’t aboard you so why you want to kill them babies they didn’t asked to come here like we didn’t asked 

Okay so all of you have an opinion... well i have fact... one its late stages of pregnancy the babies are formed to perfectly for them to just of found out.. two im a mum and i dont believe in late term abortion or abortion in genral unless there is valid reason... those reasons are abusive relationships if the woman falls pregnant in a situation she had no controle over... a victim of rape … More
Feb 10
Judgment has already been made .. this is murder and genocide. Regardless if it is rape or any other situation. It wasn't that child's fault... killing the child that is very much alive and feeling is murder.. life begins at conception this irregard for life to throw our babies away in the evening trash is no better than the mentality of the rapist of this world who take advantage of women and … More
Feb 11
I understand your point of view but you never know how the baby is gonna be born it’s a miracle to have a baby and it’s life telling that there is still hope! They told my mother that my little sister was gonna have Down syndrome and that it was gonna be a complicated pregnancy and life for the baby!! My sister is now 14 and is perfectly fine! My little brother had 4 holes according to the … More

Just goes to show we’re all just meat. First we’re fish, and then we breathe dry air and become mammals. Either way we’re all just meat.

Feb 9
LOVECHILDREN what is your problem? Apleaplea didn't say anything wrong. He just said that it's late term abortion when baby is alive and he is right, also he said that doesn't agree with late term abortion. I study biology and I can clearly see that this was late term pregnancy. So what's the problem? Also, it's YOU'RE and not YOUR, learn English instead of flaming people on random sites for no … More

It is very important that such things are made available to the public. Who is in favor of abortion needs to see what he is in favor off.
A recent Government report has revealed that Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, received over $1.5 billion in taxpayer funds from 2013 to 2015.
The Guttmacher Institute has looked at the reasons for late-term abortion,
Feb 10
any woman that screams, "my body-my choice", needs to consider birth control if she cannot keep her knees together. definitely she needs to see this in high school sex education. this is repulsive on too many levels. every woman that has an abortion has no heart or soul.
Feb 8
This is late term abortion and only done in cases where the fetus has birth defeacts that would subject the child to suffering if it was born. Or the mothers life was at risk or if the fetus had died already in utero. Franly I may not have one and i have carried a dead baby inside me until my body went into full labor and i am all for womens rights. Just cause somethng is not right for me does … More

I don't see your point. A "late term" child is the same child it was early on.

CAN'T WAIT TILL GOD'S JUDGEMENT COMES UPON THOSE THAT KILL A LOVING CHILD.

Hey LOVECHILDREN if that’s even your real name lol, you have no right to cast judgement on these people your sin is just as bad as any of theirs you are in the same boat as a murderer, a drug user, or any kind of sinner God doesn’t discriminate against sin nor his children he loves us all and you can’t and won’t judge them you Hippocrate calling the name of the lord as a rath on their heads this … More

This is the horrifying truth of abortion. Look closely. This is a perfect formed human being. If this were done to animals the ASPCA and their following would be in an uproar. Why aren’t we as a nation?
Feb 9
birth control isn't 100% effective you know. and some of 'em have detrimental side effects
Feb 8
I swear people are so stupid to support abortion. Why open your legs to someone you don’t even want to have kids with. And rape is not always the case. There’s always adoption. You know the consequences but are lazy and stupid.
Feb 8
A lot of women use birth control and try their best to not have a kid so it's their choice to have it or not. Also if you really think adoption is the best, many kids given for adoption sometimes never get adopted, if you really care about children you'd be helping by adopting as many kids you can or doing charity. Sometimes people don't even care about the children themselves, but only the "… More

@Ceci_xoxo5 think tho you can give a childup for adoption but do you ever adopt your self more children going for adoption than people adopting meansitdoesnt work

THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD ADOPT A CHILD NO MATTER WHAT . IT ALL WORKS OUT . RAPPED OR NOT. WATCH WERE A PERSON TALKS ABOUT SURVIVING AN ABORTION. THEY WANT TO LIVE. DON'T YOU WANT TO LIVE. AND IT'S YOUR CHOICE TO PUT WORDS IN A CHILD'S MOUTH. IT WAS RAPPED ... IT WORKS OUT . LIVE AND LET LIVE. I DON'T CARE . GIVE IT UP . I GUARENTEE THE CHILD WILL WELCOME … More
Feb 9
THERE WERE 1000'S OF PEOPLE WANTING TO ADOPT , HAD EVERYTHING , BUT, THERE HOUSE WAS EMPTY . AND THEY CAN'T HAVE A CHILD BUT, THE GIRL HAS A CHILD AND IT'S INCONVENIENT .. THEY WILL SEE THE CHILD IN THE NEXT LIFE.

Once again LOVECHILDREN shut up ur trying to do a good deed I know but you show it in a way that makes you seem absolutely stupid

I wish gloria.tv had a share button so we could get the word out. But I don't think there is one.

Irish society does. They voted for it. American society had it thrust upon us by the tyrants wearing black robes. The majority of Americans do not support abortion. If there were a referendum on abortion in America like there was in Ireland, abortion would be outlawed.
Feb 8
no it wouln't only 40% at most think it should be removed so don't go oh it would be outlawed. Not only is that statement false but 100% in accurate!
Please consider adoption or closed adoption! Please like and share our page!
