After hearing President-elect Trump commit to repealing the Affordable Care Act on his first day in office, I vowed to hold the Administration accountable for its actions to undermine the health coverage upon which millions of Americans rely. I recently released an account of my efforts to uncover Administration actions that threaten the health and well-being of all Americans. The report entitled, “ How to Engage in Oversight of an Uncooperative Administration: Republicans’ Secret Roadmap to Health Care Sabotage ,” details how I was able to pry closely held information of deliberate health care sabotage from the Administration.
Today, the Administration and Congressional Republicans continue to plot to take away health care coverage from hard-working Americans and their families. Until Republicans in Washington end their maniacal obsession with undermining our health care system, I will use every tool at my disposal to hold them accountable for their actions.
