Elizabeth Warren officially launched her bid for the 2020 presidency Saturday
Trump tweeted: 'Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore?'
The president also made another 'Pocahontas' swipe at the Democrat
Critics have claimed she claimed Native American heritage in hope of gaining preferential treatment as a minority
Meanwhile Warren has avoided taking direct jabs at Trump
D onald Trump couldn't help but make fun of Elizabeth Warren once again on Saturday as she officially launched her bid for the 2020 presidency.
The leader of the United States posted on social media about the US Democratic Senator's decision to challenge him for the role of POTUS, bringing up the topic of her claiming Native American heritage throughout her law career.
'Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President,' he posted on Twitter . 'Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!'  
Elizabeth Warren officially launched her bid for the 2020 presidency Saturday and Donald Trump made a dig on social media
The US President made another 'Pocahontas' swipe at the Democrat on Saturday in a tweet
Trump began calling Warren 'Pocahontas' in the spring of 2016 in order to blunt her attacks as she threatened to become a key surrogate for his presidential rival Hillary Clinton.
'Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas because she faked the fact she is native American, is a lowlife!' he tweeted as the Republican primary season wrapped up in May 2016.
Critics have claimed she claimed Native American heritage in hope of gaining preferential treatment as a minority.  
Weaving specific policy prescriptions into her remarks on Tuesday, from Medicare for All to the elimination of Washington 'lobbying as we know it',  Warren avoided taking direct jabs at Trump. 
She aimed for a broader institutional shift instead, urging supporters to choose 'a government that makes different choices, choices that reflect our values'.
Trump 'is not the cause of what's broken,' Warren told an elated crowd in Lawrence, in her home state of Massachusetts, without using the president's name.
'He's just the latest – and most extreme – symptom of what's gone wrong in America.'
Warren takes to the stage during an event to formally launch her presidential campaign. Mr Trump 'is not the cause of what's broken,' Ms Warren told an elated crowd in Lawrence
The Massachusetts woman acknowledges cheers as she takes the stage during an event. She said Trump is 'just the latest – and most extreme – symptom of what's gone wrong in America'
Warren delivered a sharp call for change at her presidential kick-off, decrying a 'middle-class squeeze' 
Warren delivered a sharp call for change at her presidential kick-off, decrying a 'middle-class squeeze' that has left Americans crunched with 'too little accountability for the rich, too little opportunity for everyone else'. 
She called to fight economic inequality and build 'an America that works for everyone' as she asked for support in her campaign. 
She and her backers hope that message can distinguish her in a crowded Democratic field and help her move past the controversy surrounding her past claims to Native American heritage.
The New York Times  reported last month that Warren worries she damaged her standing with Native American groups and other liberal blocs, especially minority constituencies, by willingly releasing her DNA results. 
Warren's results were her ultimate response in October 2018 as Trump continued to taunt her during public rallies. Trump has mocked her for years, calling her 'Pocahontas' and a 'fake Indian'.
On Monday it was revealed Warren apologized to the Cherokee Nation after releasing the results of a DNA test that showed a tiny sliver of her ancestry was Native American. 
Donald Trump Jr. tweeted suggesting a handwritten document showing she identified as 'American Indian' was leaked on the same day as the SOTU address so it would go under radar
Pocahontas was an Algonqiuan Indian princess who lived from 1595 to 1617
Tuesday the 69-year-old responded after the emergence of a State Bar of Texas registration card showing she identified as 'American Indian' on April 18, 1986. 
'I can't go back,' Warren told The Washington Post  Tuesday. 'But I am sorry for furthering confusion on tribal sovereignty and tribal citizenship and harm that resulted.' 
Warren told the Post the apology on Tuesday applied to her records for Harvard, University of Pennsylvania and Association of American Law Schools. 
Supporters turned out in below-freezing temperatures, many hoisting signs — 'Win With Warren,' one read.
A Massachusetts bakery created 'Persist' cookies for the event to honor the candidate's slogan, 'Nevertheless, She Persisted,' words first spoken in the Senate to rebuke her.
Asked if fellow New Englander Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, could pose a serious threat to Warren in New Hampshire's critical primary should he get into the race, longtime backer Carlos Garcia said Ms Warren is 'such an effective communicator that I think that people will respond to that very well'.
Warren (top right) is part of a growing field of potential Democratic presidential nominees that also includes (from top left) former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Cory Booker, Senator Kamala Harris; and (from bottom left) Senator Sherrod Brown, Senator Bernie Sanders, Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
Warren went straight from her kick-off to New Hampshire, home to the nation's first primary, where her campaign projected that 350 people turned out for an event in the city of Dover.
She plans to spend Sunday in Iowa, where the lead-off caucuses will be the first test of candidates' viability.
Ms Warren enters the race as one of the party's most recognisable figures.
She has spent the past decade in the national spotlight, first emerging as a consumer activist during the financial crisis.
She later led the congressional panel that oversaw the 2008 financial industry bailout.
After Republicans blocked her from running the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency she helped create, she ran for the Senate in 2012 and unseated a Republican incumbent.
