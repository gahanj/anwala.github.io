South Korea has agreed to pay more to the United States for its forces stationed there. The new deal must still be approved by South Korea’s parliament. It would boost Seoul’s contribution to over one trillion won, or almost 900 million dollars. That’s an increase of eight percent from the previous year. The two allies are expected to negotiate a new deal later this year. About 28,000 U.S. troops have been stationed on the Peninsula since the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice. The South Korean contribution covers wages for their civilian workers, construction costs for U.S. bases, and logistics support expenses.
