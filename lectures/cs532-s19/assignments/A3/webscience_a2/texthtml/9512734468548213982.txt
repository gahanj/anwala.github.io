In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Trump made an appeal for bipartisanship, asking Congress to “reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution.”
That plea evidently didn’t resonate with one senior adviser to his reelection campaign. Katrina Pierson, who also served as Trump’s national campaign spokeswoman in 2016, took to Twitter after the speech to compare Democratic congresswomen who wore white in tribute to the suffragists to the Ku Klux Klan.
 
The only thing that the Democrats uniform was missing tonight is the matching hood.
Pierson’s jab was among the discordant notes on a night the president had pitched as a paean to cooperation before mostly sticking to hard-line demands for a wall along the southern border and repeating attack lines against undocumented immigrants.
Despite the Democrats protest Trump paused to recognize the great achievement of the newly elected women to Congress, many of whom are Democrats.
