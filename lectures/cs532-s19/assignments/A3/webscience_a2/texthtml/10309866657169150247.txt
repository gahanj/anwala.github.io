So he doesn't hesitate to swipe job growth from the twilight of the Obama administration and claim it as his own. That overreach, seen in his State of the Union speech and other forums, extends to his boast about the shrinking numbers of people on food stamps, where he's helped himself even more heartily to Obama-era progress.
