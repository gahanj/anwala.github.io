John Cleese
MSNBC just gave a precise explanation of Trump's thinking:
'He views The Rule of Law as presidential harassment'
To comprehend this, remember Trump's life is built on the premise that there are no rules that apply to him.
He even cheats at golf
Everything follows from that

1. Exactly right.
3. I have a friend who plays Golf and is an investor
When someone proposes a deal to him, the first thing he does is play Golf with them, if they cheat he knows what type of character he is dealing with and the deal is off.
Of course not everyone plays Golf, but he has other ways to define prospective partners characters, and playing games is one way to do it.
The orange buffoon cheats at everything, he is a low life.
7. When Michelle Obama first started dating our future President, she asked
her basketball star brother Craig Robinson to shoot some hoops with him;
"When Robinson's sister, Michelle, began dating her law firm colleague,�Barack Obama, who played basketball recreationally, she asked her brother to play with Obama and give her a character assessment so that she would know whether she could become serious with him.[10][11]�He gave an encouraging report to her.[9][12]�As he later related, "When I played basketball with Barack, he was quietly confident, which means he had good self-esteem without being cocky. He was certainly a team player � he wasn't a pig, he passed when he was supposed to pass, and he cut when he was supposed to cut. To me, that speaks to a lack of selfishness. He had natural leadership ability, because he didn't just pass me the ball because he was dating my sister. Whenever a player gets tired, he reverts to the player he truly is. That's how you tell. And we played for hours. That's how I could tell."[10]�The story of this�pick-up game�and of a "test" being passed became a key part of the Obama narrative.[10]"
17. What a great description of how to gauge people!
Watch them when they�re tired because the true person will through.  Especially in when competition activity is present.
4. If you cheat at golf
you will likely cheat on your taxes as well as on your spouse.
5. I play golf with an 85 year old,
he routinely shoots his age or better. When other people play with us (he keeps score) if he sees them "rolling their ball" he simply doesn't mark down the score for that hole. He told me that when you don't cheat you don't have to worry if people are watching you. I like the look on people's faces when they ask him what they shot, after 9 holes and he says 21. (lots of blank holes.)
6. WhatZig Ziglar says in his book:
"The Secrets of Closing The Sale" is that "A man who will cheat at golf will cheat at anything.". He hit the nail on the head when it comes to drumpf.
8. He was on MSNBC this morning? What show? nt

10. Everything follows.
12. He* even cheats at golf.  How republican is that?
* republican draft-dodger-in-chief
13. Nobody will tread you better than they treat their own loved ones.
My Dad used to say that.
Look at how he�s treated his wives.
14. And his brother and nephew.
"Donald Trump cut off medical treatment to his nephew's sick baby"
19. Not surprising since he tears families apart and imprisons children.
Frankly, I honestly expect him to throw his own children under the bus if he thinks that can save his own hide.  Even Ivanka.
I also suspect they suspect this too, which is why they defend him so hard.

16. K&R
He is incapable of following the rules or the rule of law.  He is thoroughly immoral with an outrageous sense of entitlement.
He is a repulsive excuse of a human being.
22. Another to keep the estate tax on large estates ...
to avoid raising spoiled, entitled, amoral people like DT.
23. Good Grief, you Libtardy people!!! Trump never cheats❗❗❗
I have it on good authority that Trump was the Captain of the Trump University Golf Team, a position that required HugelyHonesty.
And when the TUGT played the GreatLeader Kim Il-sung University Golf Team (GLKIsUGT) Trump counted every stroke of the 18 hole match against DearLeader  Kim Jong Il beating the Commie's 34 with a 40 under par 32.

25. In college...
Don the Con was captain of the golf team at Sam Houston Institute of
Technology.  He wanted the cheerleaders to follow him and yell
"Go SHIT" when HIS OPPONENT was about to swing!!!
27. Great observations...
� as a K-12 teacher, I can report this cheating starts early... the normal child grows... most everyone grows beyond this, a normal part of child development.  But there are those who cheat far beyond normalcy.  They cheat in sports, academics, everything... the "lessons" they learn, no matter what you do, are "What can I get away with?" and "How can I improve my cheating?" There is n help from home, because the practice is accepted there.
