A woman who helped reverse a rule against bee-killing neonicotinoid pesticides and GMO crops on national wildlife refuges has been chosen to oversee the protection (or some say destruction) of national wildlife refuges
In what environmental groups are calling a cruel joke, the Trump administration’s has chosen a former agro-chemical executive to head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service.
Aurelia Skipwith worked as a corporate affairs executive at Monsanto for six years before spending the last year and a half in the U.S. Department of the Interior, where she oversaw the dismantling  of dozens of wildlife protections, including:
The discontinuation of studies assessing the impact of pesticides on endangered species
The reversal of a decision  prohibiting bee-killing neonicotinoid pesticides and genetically modified crops on national wildlife refuges.
If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Skipwith’s duties will include enforcing federal wildlife laws, protecting endangered species, managing migratory birds, and conserving and restoring wildlife habitat.
It should also be noted — since one of her main duties would be to protect fish — that agro-chemical companies like Monsanto are largely to blame for the “dead zones” of the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, where runoff from synthetic fertilizers and pesticides has contributed to making entire coastlines uninhabitable by fish.
The pick continues a Trump Administration trend of filling top environmental positions with members of the industries the agencies are intended to regulate, notes the Organic Consumers Association .
It also continues a trend of government, in general, to put the fox in charge of guarding the hen house.

She knows the chemical companies. You have that exactly correct. She had already worked to dismantle existing wildlife protection.
What makes you think that she will support our environment over her profits.
BTW. This is systemic. USDA has had multiple members of Monsanto and other companies on its board for years … Who, when the job is finished, go right back to their field positions within their respective companies.

In my neighborhood, I am finding so many dead bees in my yard. We don’t use pesticides but apparently some of the neighbors do although I don’t know which ones. Every other week, my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter asks me why do the bees die. They crawl around until they die. It is so sad, wish I knew what to do about it.
Pretty sure the appointment of yet another Monsanto Minion won’t help. I think that company is so evil and feel they are a major problem of decimating the earth

Where’s input from any of the 50 state wildlife commissions, Audubon Society, Nat. Wildlife Fund, Ducks Unlimited, and any other game specific hunting and fishing groups as well as various commercial fishing and guide services?
What is her background as a sportswoman in any capacity or a birding enthusiast or ..? This makes no sense.

What’s the difference between red tide and blue-green algae?
Both are photosynthetic microscopic organisms that live in water. Blue-green algae are properly called cyanobacteria. Some species of cyanobacteria occur in the ocean, but blooms – extremely high levels that create green surface scums of algae – happen mainly in lakes and rivers, where salinity is low.
Red tides are caused by a type of algae called a dinoflagellate, which also is ubiquitous in lakes, rivers, estuaries and the oceans. But the particular species that causes red tide blooms, which can literally make water look blood red, occur only in saltwater.
What causes these blooms?
Blooms occur where lakes, rivers or near-shore waters have high concentrations of nutrients – in particular, nitrogen and phosphorus. Some lakes and rivers have naturally high nutrient concentrations. However, in Lake Okeechobee and the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee estuaries, man-made nutrient pollution from their watersheds is causing the blooms. Very high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus are washing into the water from agricultural lands, leaky septic systems and fertilizer runoff.

“The Washington DC-based environmental organization Mighty Earth set out to determine which specific companies were most responsible for “the widespread manure and fertilizer pollution contaminating water from the Heartland to the Gulf.”
“America’s largest meat company, Tyson Foods, stood out for its expansive footprint in all the regions suffering the worst pollution impacts from industrial meat and feed production,” a press release about the August report says.”
