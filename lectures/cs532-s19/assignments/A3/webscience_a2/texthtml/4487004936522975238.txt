The Trump family has had enough of the slander and libel against them.
This week, The Telegraph agreed to pay First Lady Melania Trump “substantial” damages after they ran an article in their magazine a week ago that included a “number of false statements” that should have never been published.
The British newspaper stated “The Mystery of Melania,” it’s cover story for it’s January 19th edition of the magazine, made erroneous claims about her family and career.
The article shockingly enough can no longer be found on the website.
The Telegraph has since wrote an explanation titled “Melania Trump — An Apology,” where they wrote that the First Lady’s father was not “a fearsome presence and did not control the family.”
It also retracted that she didn’t leave her studies of design and architecture at university due to an exam, but because she wanted to pursue her career as a model.
They went on to say they wrongly stated she was “struggling” as a model when she met Donald Trump, now President Trump.
In the U.S. The apology also said the story erroneously reported she cried the night her husband was elected president.
“We apologise unreservedly to The First Lady and her family for any embarrassment caused by our publication of these allegations,” the Telegraph article said. “As a mark of our regret we have agreed to pay Mrs. Trump substantial damages as well as her legal costs.

Thrilled to see that she won! Now, CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, VOX and I am sure many others needs to be sued as well! I am going to post this on everyone of their websites and ask “Are you next”!
