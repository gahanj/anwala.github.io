Fundamentalist Christians are strong supporters of President Donald Trump, even though he seems to have violated all of the 10 commandments. And even though first lady Melania Trump was a part-time softcore porn model, fundamentalists are still urging Trump to wage war on pornography.
Rick Wiles, a crackpot End Times preacher, has come up with a unique plan to help fund Trump’s proposed border wall.
“We know that masturbation is a grave sin, but many of the young people are still doing it,” said Wiles on Jim Bakker’s show. “Trump could pass a tax on masturbation supplies, such as lube and Kleenex, and the government could use that to pay for the wall.”
Arizona politician Gail Griffin had a similar idea. She suggested Trump fund the wall with fees from pornography blocking software.
“House Bill 2444 would require companies that make or sell electronic devices in Arizona to install software that blocks porn. To remove the block, all you’d have to do is prove you are 18 and plunk down $20, payable to the Arizona Commerce Authority,” said Laurie Roberts of The Arizona Republic. “The money would go into a newly created account called the John McCain Human Trafficking and Child Exploitation Fund, with the proceeds to be used for one of 10 things.”
Many Evangelicals seem to be obsessed with the dangers of masturbation. According to a Christian Post article, some Christians blamed porn and masturbation for the falling birth rate.
“Teenagers are having less sex now partly because of the easy accessibility of online pornography, Kate Julian noted, referencing a 2017 study in the Journal of Population Economics which examined the introduction of broadband Internet at the county-by-county level. The study found that with the arrival of high-speed Internet, the teen birth rate fell 7 to 13 percent from 1999 to 2007,” said The Post.
