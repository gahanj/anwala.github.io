ââU.S. President Donald Trump has appealed for unity among Americans in his second State of the Union address on Tuesday evening at Capitol Hill, urging the  two parties to work together and unite the nation. 
"Victory is not winning for our party, victory is winning for our country," he told Congress and Americans.
"The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican Agenda or a Democrat Agenda. It is the agenda of the American people," Trump said, urging the Republican Party and the Democrats to work together "for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure."
"We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good."
'Unprecedented economic boom'
Trump said:
- 5.3 million new jobs were created, including 600,000 new manufacturing jobs;
- Unemployment fell to 3.7 percent, the lowest in over half a century;
- Estate tax for small businesses, ranches, and family farms was cut;
- Obamacare's individual mandate penalty was repealed.
Trump said the U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when he took office, praising it as the hottest economy anywhere in the world.

Trump said in the State of the Union address that border issue is a moral one and that the U.S. is committed to ending illegal immigration.
"The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well-being of all Americans," Trump said. "We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens." 
Besides for illegal immigration, Trump also said the government is to crack down on the human traffickers, cartels and drug dealers that are also part of the border issue.
In his speech, Trump reiterated his determination to build the border wall despite the fact the parties have yet failed to reach a funding deal.
"Where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down," Trump said.

Trump highlighted the strong presence of women in the country's workforce as 58% of all new jobs created last year were filled by women. 
"We also have more women serving in Congress than ever before," Trump said. 
Tuesday night saw a group of Democratic women, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, dressed in suffragette white in support of women's "hard-earned rights".

U.S. to continue defense buildup
Trump said the U.S. will keep build up its military defense and never apologize for advancing America's interests.
"The United States is developing a state-of-the-art missile defense system."
He mentioned the latest withdrawal from the INF treaty with Russia, saying there might be an option to come up with a different multilateral treaty, or perhaps no.
