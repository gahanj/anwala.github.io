Hello All!
One last update here. I received the funds today. No refunds were requested which is incredibly generous of you all!  I've already contacted the Annunciation House and will be getting the donation over asap. Thank you again.
Hello! So here is where we are. The total of the Go Fund Me after fees is $3,909.90. Total cost incurred is $1,443.12. Leaving us at $2,466.78 to be donated. The funds are not available yet, they will not be until the 18th. All cost up till now have been taken care of out of pocket. The cost covered shipping and equipment needed to get baby Trump in the air.
El Paso is now an official channel for Baby Trump! They would like to keep one on the border for future needs. So please reach out to https://www.babytrumptour.org/ for any request.
A few of you asked about refunds. I would like to offer refunds to anyone who donated and would like their money back. Please message me here through Go Fund Me with proof of your donation and I'll contact you directly. Please keep in mind the Annunciation House runs on donations. It would be great if we can get them as much support as possible.
 
 
Hello all, quick update. The winds are pretty bad today. We are doing all we can to see what we can do to get Baby Trump up. I'll send a update shortly.
