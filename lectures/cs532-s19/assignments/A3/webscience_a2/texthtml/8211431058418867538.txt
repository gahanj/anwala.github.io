We created this in June of last year to promote the launch of this site and ran it as a advertisement on FB and Twitter.  The ad said, "Join the Social Media Revolution."  
 It didn't do well at all and generated almost no response. But a month later Jon McNaughton, came out with his "Crossing the Swamp," which was an original piece of art based on the same idea.  Now granted ours was not a true work of Art but was just a modification of the classic Painting; however we were surprised that his piece went insanely virile while a month earlier ours barely got any clicks. Such is the world of promotion.
Is this the "New" Democratic Party we've Heard  about.
