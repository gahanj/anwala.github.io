Some people just had enough of Elizabeth Warren’s talking.
During the Senator’s official announcement for president today in Lawrence, Massachusetts, some “supporters” positioned directly behind her split early.
Watch:
Before the event started, the duo was see huddled together under a blanket. As the rally dragged on and Warren spoke at length, they’d finally had enough and left.
The man wearing a green shirt could be seen whispering in the woman’s ear next to him, and she soon after made room for the pair to make a break for it.
The rally was well over 2 hours long.
It’s not the first time Democrat supporters have been bored with their candidate.
During a campaign rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin in 2016, at least one Hillary Clinton supporter seemed to be less than impressed with her presentation.
The woman, positioned by the campaign perfectly in front of the cameras and standing right behind the candidate, repeatedly yawned and clapped tepidly throughout the Democratic front runner’s remarks.
At one point, she held up her “Fighting For Us” rally sign over her face to try to conceal her yawn, but even that didn’t seem to help.
