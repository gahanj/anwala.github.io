(5 Feb 2019) White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway on Monday said US President Donald Trump would use his State of the Union address "to call for an end to the politics of resistance, retribution".
"He's calling for cooperation", she said, adding that Trump will point to examples of where this has happened on his watch.
Officials said the president is also expected to highlight infrastructure, trade and prescription drug pricing as areas in which the parties could work together.
Conway added that President Trump may declare a national emergency so that he can get funds for a US-Mexico border wall, but he sees this as a last resort.
She also defended the president's use of his time, calling him a "very active president".
