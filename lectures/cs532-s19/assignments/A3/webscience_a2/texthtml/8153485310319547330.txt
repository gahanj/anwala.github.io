Our products
We specialise in a range of products including necklaces, bracelets, pet ID tags, trainer tags & keyrings.
Our skills
We offer a wide range of hand made, hand stamped gifts for all occasions.
Our inspiration
Our products are hand made to order from our family run workshop in the Lake District, UK.
We are very proud to be a family run business. Using traditional techniques, our range of handcrafted products are individually shaped, cut, polished and then personalised by hand stamping. Using only hand tools means that no two pieces are ever the same - quite simply every piece is handmade and individually unique. Our aim is to provide a range of inspiring and thoughtful gifts for any occasion. Don't just think it, say it!
If you are looking for a unique product which will be totally memorable, a wonderful keepsake, super thoughtful and completely unique - then look no further!
