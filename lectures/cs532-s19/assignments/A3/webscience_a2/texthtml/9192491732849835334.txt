We are excited to announce the 2018 recipients of our annual leadership awards. The goal of the Day 1 Families Fund awards is to shine a light and support the organizations that are doing compassionate, needle-moving work to provide shelter for young families in communities across the country.
These 24 organizations are working on a number of initiatives that support families in need – from emergency shelter and safe short-term shelter for families to get on their feet, to access and support for permanent housing and support services that help families move forward together. We hope these grants provide the additional resources these leaders and their organizations need to expand the scope and impact of their efforts.
