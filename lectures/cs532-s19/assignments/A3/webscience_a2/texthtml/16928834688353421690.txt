Craig Unger said Donald Trump has been compromised by Russia "for decades"—and he's not the only one.
President Donald Trump is not the end of Russia’s financial links to the United States, according to a biographer who has written about ties between Trump and the Russian mob.
In a Reddit AMA , Craig Unger, author of House of Trump, House of Putin: The Untold Story of Donald Trump and the Russian Mafia, said Trump has been compromised by Russia “for decades” — and that other Republicans have fallen prey to Russian influence as well.
“Trump was first compromised by the Russians in the Eighties back in the days of the Soviet Union and the Cold War,” Unger wrote. “In 1984, my book shows, the Russian Mafia first began to use Trump real estate to launder money and it continued for decades and may have accounted for billions of dollars flowing to Trump.”
In 1998, he added, Trump took out full-page ads in the New York Times and the Washington Post after his first trip to Russia that touted “a foreign policy that was very anti-NATO.”
Rep. Tom DeLay (R-TX) — who represented Texas from 1985 until 2006 and served as House Majority Leader from 2003 to 2005 — began receiving money from Russia in the 1990s, according to Unger.
“I believe most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by” Russian money, the author added. “The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee run by Mitch McConnell got millions from [Soviet-born businessman] Leonard Blavatnik.”
“As for the endgame,” Unger concluded, “I think it is already [beginning] to unravel.”
