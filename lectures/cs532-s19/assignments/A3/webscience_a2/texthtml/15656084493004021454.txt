President Donald Trump has selected eight ambassadors from the ranks of his paying members across his various golf clubs, according to a Friday USA Today report.
These golfers would represent countries including South Africa, the Dominican Republic, Hungary and Romania.
As USA Today points out, it’s not rare for Presidents to give out smaller ambassadorships to close allies. What is unusual, though, is that most Presidents don’t run their administrations while sustaining such deep entanglements with their businesses.
“You have to question whether these members of his clubs are getting these appointments because they deserve them or because they’re his paying customers,” Jordan Libowitz, the communications director for CREW, told USA Today. “You get into really bad territory when people start wondering if the President has put the government up for sale.”
