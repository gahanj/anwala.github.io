EA on talkRADIO: Journey Through TrumpLand — Bezos, the National Enquirer, & Trump
Donald Trump with David Pecker, CEO of American Media Inc. (File)
In our latest 15-minute journey through TrumpLand, I joined talkRADIO’s Alexis Conran to discuss the connection between Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, the tabloid National Enquirer, and Donald Trump.
We explain Bezos’ declaration that he is being blackmailed by the Enquirer over his impending divorce and current relationship. The personal and the political intersect, as David Pecker — the CEO of the Enquirer’s parent company — is a close friend of Trump and has used the tabloid to spread false stories about Trump’s opponents. Pecker even handled a $150,000 payoff during the 2016 campaign to Karen McDougal, the former Playboy model who claimed a 10-month affair with Trump in 2006.
We also discuss the state of America, following a Trump State of the Union address that was upstaged by women legislators and disapproving military commanders. And there’s an update on the Trump-Russia investigation.
