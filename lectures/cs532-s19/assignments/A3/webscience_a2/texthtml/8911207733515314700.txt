Dr. David Duke is a PhD of History,  and former member of the House of Representatives in Louisiana. He came within whisper of winning a U.S. Senate Seat in 1990, and in 1991 unseated the sitting Republican governor of Louisiana.
As you can readily discern by this video Dr. Duke is completely different from the image of manufactured by the globalist media. He has been an anti-war activist all over the world, and a true human rights activist for freedom of speech and thought, and the fundamental rights of all people to be free and independent and have government that represents their true interests rather than the globalist elite.
