EXCLUSIVE to @FoxNews …New Air Force One’s coming… @realDonaldTrump reached an informal deal with Boeing for 2 new AF-1s. Fixed price deal is for $3.9 million. WH says this is a savings of $1.4 billion on total original cost estimates of more than $5billion
“President Trump has reached an informal deal with Boeing on a fixed price contract for the air force one program. Thanks to the president’s negotiations the contract will save the taxpayers more than $1.4 billion,” deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News.
Trump made the issue of lowering the price of the next generation of Air Force One airplanes an issue in the early days of his transition period.
Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!
“The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program. I think it’s ridiculous, I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,” he told reporters in December 2016.
