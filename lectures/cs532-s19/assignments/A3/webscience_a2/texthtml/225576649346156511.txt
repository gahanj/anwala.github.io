HOUSTON, TX— Rep. Robert “Beto” O’Rourke (D-Texas) continued today his reckless and radical Senate campaign based on impeaching Pres. Donald Trump. He is the only candidate to the U.S. Senate to call for impeachment.
The most recent incident was at the National Press Club in Washington D.C.  In response to a question by the Dallas Morning News , O’Rourke said: “…if I were asked to vote on this, I would vote to impeach the president.”  O’Rourke explained that, “Impeachment, much like an indictment, shows that there is enough there for the case to proceed and at this point there is certainly enough there for the case to proceed.”
O’Rourke has been consistent throughout his campaign for U.S. Senate that he would vote to impeach  Pres. Trump, such as on KFYO radio  on April 10, on Showtime’s “The Circus”  in May — and as far back as an interview with Reuters  in November 2017.
