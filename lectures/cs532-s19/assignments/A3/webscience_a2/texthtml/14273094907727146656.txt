In January 2018, according to the results of the medical examination, doctor Ronnie Jackson noted that Trump is in excellent physical shape, and his mental health is beyond doubt. However, the doctor drew attention to the extra weight of the American leader, who was the result of the love of fast food.
In the same year, Russian Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov, commenting on Trump’s health information, said that the Kremlin does not plan to report in detail and publicly, as is done in the United States, about Vladimir Putin’s health. He stressed that the Russian legislation “does not provide for mandatory publication of data on the president’s health,” but said that “the president is completely healthy and can give a head start to many.”
Putin himself during a big press conference in December 2018 in response to the question of how he feels, joked : “Do not wait!”. According to the head of state, “his health is the same as everyone’s.”
