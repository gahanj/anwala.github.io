Mueller indicts 16 Russians for allegedly helping TRUMP in 2016 but?
Editor: Johnathan Meyers | Tactical Investor
One of the main reasons we cover such a broad range of topics is because the masses are being systematically brainwashed to see what they are being directed to see. You can only solve the problem if you understand the problem; if you do not, you will either never solve it or continue trending on the path of stupidity forever. To become a good investor, you need to see the full picture and not the snippets that the mass media conveniently and almost gleefully is willing to provide.  Mass psychology states that it is imperative to acknowledge the forest while looking at the tree. In other words, emotions drive the markets, and you need to focus on what emotions Mass Media is trying to stir up to spot the next significant trend. With that in mind, we think you might find the following article to of interest:
 
Special counsel Robert Mueller’s office has charged three Russian entities and 13 Russian nationals with “violating US criminal laws in order to interfere with US elections and political processes.”
The indictment was the fifth in Mueller’s Russia investigation, which is examining the extent of Russia’s election interference and whether members of President Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with Moscow to tilt the race in his favor.
