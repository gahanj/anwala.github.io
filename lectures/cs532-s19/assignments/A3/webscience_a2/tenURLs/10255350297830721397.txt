Rosie O'Donnell told NBC Late Night host Seth Meyers that she has been in a "severe depression" since Trump won the presidency in November 2016. O'Donnell said she spends "90 percent of my waking hours tweeting hatred towards" Trump. O'Donnell also recounted how their infamous feud began with commentary made during her time on The View.
"As bad as everyone feels and they have felt since November 8th, I know for me, I've been in a severe depression," she said. "Although I'd like to say, today after your show I'm going to get a Bob Mueller tattoo. Because I love him."
O'Donnell also revealed she has a therapist that she uses to talk about her outrage at Trump.
